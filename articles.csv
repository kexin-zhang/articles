HONG KONG When U.S. private equity heavyweight Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] started looking at China's logistics sector in late 2009, there were more modern warehouses in Boston than in the whole of the world's most populous country.

But as Chinese consumers embarked on an online shopping spree, demand has soared from appliance makers, express delivery firms and e-commerce companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc, far outpacing supply and prompting a parallel binge in investment in warehouses and logistics businesses.

Deep-pocket investors including Carlyle Group LP, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Warburg Pincus have splashed $12 billion on the sector in China since 2013, says real estate consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle.

""The thinking was even if it didn't necessarily scale to the size we were anticipating, we had a good sense that while Boston is a pretty decent size city in the U.S., China should have far more modern warehousing space over the longer term,"" said Jeffrey Perlman, who heads Southeast Asia at Warburg Pincus and also focuses on real estate investments across Asia Pacific.

""We were taking that directional bet that, with this transformative shift from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-, consumption-based economy, ultimately you need to store the goods somewhere.""

Although China's economy expanded in the second quarter at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis of 2008-09, online shopping revenues have soared and are expected to double to 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.13 trillion) in 2018 from last year, consumer and internet consultancy iResearch estimates.

Online retail as a percentage of total retail in China has grown steadily to 12.6 percent, and is forecast to reach 17 percent in 2018, according to iResearch and China's National Statistics Bureau.

By comparison, U.S. e-commerce sales accounted for 8.1 percent of total sales in the second quarter of 2016, underscoring the fast adoption of online shopping in China, where consumers with rising incomes use smartphones to order everything from appliances and clothes to flowers and pizza.

India, another emerging Asian giant with a burgeoning middle class, has seen a similar trend and is also attracting investment in warehouses.

""These changes are structural changes,"" said Jimmy Phua, head of real estate Asia at CPPIB. ""Certainly competition has been increasing. What we know, what we see is no secret, the world sees it as well. Other investors, other managers, can see that in this sector there will be sustained growth.""

China's logistics market reached 1 trillion yuan in 2015, led by an increase in so-called storage spending that includes warehousing, processing and packaging of goods.

CPPIB has committed $2.6 billion to China's logistics market, including a $1 billion investment unveiled late in 2015 in a venture with Goodman Group.

Warburg Pincus-backed e-Shang has grown into one of the largest logistics providers for e-commerce companies including JD.com, with Thomson Reuters publication IFR saying the company could raise $1 billion in a 2016 initial public offering (IPO).

To be sure, the surge in investments has created an oversupply of warehouses and pressured rents, particularly in smaller cities, while increased competition from new players has made it harder to secure land in top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, analysts and investors said.

Still, investors expect the impact on rents will be less severe for large, more modern warehouses that have been the focus of private equity firms, while the oversupply of logistics space will likely be limited to lower-tier cities.

Real estate consultant DTZ Cushman & Wakefield forecasts warehousing space will grow 10 percent a year through 2020.

""E-commerce particularly is growing at rates that are significantly higher than the overall GDP growth, that's a huge demand driver for the logistics sector,"" said Jason Lee, Carlyle Group LP's head of Asia real estate.

Carlyle-backed China Logistics Property Holdings Co Ltd, which just went public in Hong Kong in a $459 million IPO in July, is spending 2.1 billion yuan in 2016 to add some 1.1 million square meters (11.8 million square feet) of new warehousing space to its portfolio this year and build new warehouses that will be completed in 2017.

With planned investments of $1.8 billion through 2019, the company expects to build 34 new logistics parks, adding 4.5 million square meters of space, according to its IPO prospectus.

Hong Kong-based real estate private equity firm Gaw Capital Partners, which joined last year with logistics company Vailog China to develop and buy warehouses, is raising a second investment vehicle after making a $300 million push last year.

The second vehicle, with co-investments from sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, will close in the next 3-6 months and will be at least the same size, said Kenny Gaw, president and managing principal at Gaw Capital.

""I can't predict how the growth of e-commerce will be in the next 10 years, but it's still one of the fastest growing sectors in China,"" Gaw said. ""And China will remain the biggest e-commerce market in the world.""

The new policy, issued on Monday in a letter to new and returning students, follows a public furor surrounding the sexual assault of an unconscious, intoxicated woman by Stanford swimmer Brock Turner outside a frat party in 2015.

Outrage over the six-month jail term Turner received in June, widely condemned as too lenient, and the victim's account of the assault and its repercussions on her life has helped galvanize concern about rape on U.S. college campuses and the role played by alcohol abuse.

It also brought a torrent of unfavorable attention to Silicon-Valley-based Stanford, which ranks as one of the nation's most prestigious private research institutions.

Stanford insisted on Tuesday that the new policy was part of long-evolving tighter alcohol restrictions that had nothing to do with Turner.

University officials pointed to a letter to students in March calling for new solutions to the ""serious issue"" of on-campus drinking, particularly hard alcohol. The letter cited U.S. government data that more than 1,800 college students die each year from alcohol-related incidents and nearly 100,000 fall victim to sexual violence associated with alcohol.

""It does not emanate from the Brock Turner case,"" university spokeswoman Lisa Lapin said on Tuesday. ""Having said that, do we want to make sure that cases like Brock Turner don't happen again? Absolutely.""

The new policy prohibits any liquor bottles of 750 ml or larger in any housing for its nearly 7,0000 undergraduates - even students at or above California's legal drinking age of 21. Smaller containers of hard alcohol, defined as 20 percent alcohol by volume, are still allowed.

Also newly banned is consumption of hard liquor by undergrads at all campus parties, regardless of container size or students' age.

The policy exempts graduate housing and parties hosted by campus groups consisting entirely of grad students.

The new rules drew criticism from some quarters, including Stanford law professor and sociologist Michele Landis Dauber, who called the restrictions misguided.

Dauber, who is leading a petition drive seeking to recall the judge who sentenced Turner, said rather than curb liquor consumption the policy would ""change the place where it's consumed"" by students.

""They're going to pound as much hard alcohol as they possibly can in a short time period before the party,"" she said.

Back in 1972, John Lennon hired Leon Wildes, an immigration attorney who had no idea who he was.

Wildes' son, Michael, remembers his father coming home to tell his mother about their first meeting.

""And he said, 'A singer by the name of Jack Lemon and his wife Yoko Moto,' "" Michael recalls. ""My mom looked at him like he wasn't well. 'Are you talking about the Beatles and John Lennon?' My father said, 'Yeah!' ""

Over the next five years, Lennon and Ono were often caught on camera outside immigration court in New York City — as well as on late-night talk shows such as NBC's The Tomorrow Show With Tom Snyder.

""What is your status in the country right now?"" Snyder asked Lennon during a show taping in 1975.

Arizona Dreamers Five Years Later 6:32

""That's why Leon's here,"" Lennon answers. He glances over at Leon Wildes sitting across from him on a dark TV set. ""What, what am I, Leon?""

""Well, John was charged with being deportable in the U.S. for being an overstay,"" says Wildes, who has written a new book about Lennon's deportation case called John Lennon vs. The U.S.A.

In other words, Lennon was on a tourist visa that expired while he was helping his wife, Yoko Ono, with a custody battle over her daughter from a previous marriage.

So Wildes got that visa extended. But immigration officials gave them only just over month before Lennon would have to leave. Later, Wildes put in an application for a green card, which was denied.

But Lennon still wanted to stay in America.

""I like to be here because this is where the music came from,"" Lennon said. ""This is what influenced my whole life and got me where I am today.""

Wildes appealed the denial.

But FBI files show that the Nixon administration wanted Lennon, along with his anti-war activism and influence over young voters, out of the country.

So Wildes started digging for another route.

""I always had a feeling that the government must have a program to exercise some discretion,"" Wildes said.

Asked why he had that feeling, Wildes said it was ""because there were rumors of certain guys who were — had critical criminal backgrounds and bad immigration histories and seemed to be still around.""

Those guys probably benefited from what's now known as ""prosecutorial discretion."" It's based mainly on the premise that the federal government doesn't have enough resources to deport all of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

Under federal law, immigration officials can choose to prioritize certain deportation cases while holding off on other ones for humanitarian or political reasons.

The problem at the time was that Wildes didn't have proof that this kind of program existed until he filed a Freedom of Information Act request.

""When the box came into my office, there was jubilation!"" Wildes said. ""Unbelievable feeling that I had succeeded.""

In the end, Lennon received a green card, which allowed him to stay in the U.S. But those files led U.S. immigration officials to publicize a secret policy.

""Before the work of Mr. Wildes, deferred action was a complete mystery because there wasn't even a guideline for attorneys and noncitizens,"" says Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, who teaches immigration law at Penn State University and wrote Beyond Deportation: The Role of Prosecutorial Discretion in Immigration Cases.

The files showed that for decades, the government had shielded some immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from deportation because of their sympathetic cases. The Obama administration used that policy to create the original Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

""Eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization,"" said President Obama in a 2012 announcement.

An expansion of the program, as well as the creation of a similar program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, is currently on hold because of legal challenges.

But today, the original DACA program covers more than 700,000 young people brought to the U.S. as children — all in part because of that immigrant from Liverpool."
2010-07-18 00:00:00,http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/magazine/18onlanguage-anniversary.html?_r=0,Is ‘One-Year Anniversary’ Redundant?,[u'Ben Zimmer'],"[u'yearly', u'word', u'writes', u'anniversary', u'redundant', u'vanderbilt', u'oneyear', u'nth', u'meaning', u'words', u'units']","Neale Gifford writes: ""One practice that annoys me is the use of 'one-year anniversary' or 'five-year anniversary' instead of 'first' or 'fifth.' Reason? Anniversary is derived from the Latin annus meaning 'year.' "" Ed Morman writes of ""n-year anniversary,"" ""It's not very mellifluous and it is, of course redundant. Help me bring back 'nth anniversary.' ""



Gifford and Morman aren't alone in their irritation. A few years ago, when The San Francisco Chronicle ran a headline reading, ""Four-year anniversary draws protests,"" an irate reader left a profanity-riddled voicemail that unkindly insinuated what substance could be found between the ears of Phil Bronstein, then the editor of The Chronicle. (The same reader was even more offended by the appearance of ""pilotless drone"" in the newspaper, and his recorded rant became something of a Web sensation.)



The New York Times, too, is hardly immune to this redundancy. The June 28 edition, for instance, featured an article on Dylan Ratigan's ""one-year anniversary at MSNBC"" and another stating that New York's first gay pride parade commemorated ""the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising."" Philip Corbett, the newsroom's style guru, has frequently complained about this usage in his ""After Deadline"" blog but laments that his reminders have ""little effect.""



What has happened to the word anniversary? Even though the idea of yearly recurrence is built into the word etymologically, that idea has been clouded over centuries of use. And when an element of a word's meaning becomes more opaque, redundancy is one method, however inelegant, that gets used to unmuddy the waters.

As the annual aspect has moved to the background of anniversary, the shift has opened the door for use of the term to mark the passing of shorter units of time. The 11th edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, in its entry for the word, states that anniversary can refer more broadly to a date following a notable event ""by a specified period of time measured in units other than years,"" giving the example, ""the 6-month anniversary of the accident.""



Linguists call this process ""semantic bleaching"": the lessening of a word's force through generalization. The bleaching of anniversary has been going on for quite a while, even if dictionaries are only now catching up. For more than a century, English speakers have been modifying anniversary with numbers of days, weeks or months. An article in the May 5, 1901, Atlanta Constitution described the Vanderbilt family's Biltmore mansion in North Carolina, where little Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt ""celebrated the three-months anniversary of her birth by planting out a tree on the estate."" A few years later, The San Jose Evening News reported on the unseemly nature of a widow marrying on ""the third-month anniversary of her husband's death.""



Anniversary has been pressed into service for nonannual commemorations in part because English has no other commonly used terms that can fill the gap. At various times since the 19th century, the monthly equivalent of anniversary has been dubbed a mensiversary, using the Latin root mensis for ""month,"" but this ad-hoc coinage has never caught on. (Members of the Facebook group ""Make 'Mensiversary' a Word"" continue to fight the good fight.) A more recent suggestion is the clunky English-Latin hybrid monthiversary.



With pressure on anniversary to expand its reach to subannual units, it's no wonder that ""nth anniversary"" can somehow feel insufficient for traditional yearly celebrations, in need of the more explicit form, ""n-year anniversary."" But if you don't want to see the meaning of the word weakened any further, stick to the ""nth"" version and trust that others will have the good sense to discern anniversary's annualness."

""That's frickin' sick!""

At the moment when Dan Klein, singer of the retro reggae outfit the Frightnrs, saw the finished cover of his band's first full-length album, Nothing More to Say, he was sitting in his apartment in Windsor Terrace, situated in a narrow strip of blocks between Brooklyn's Prospect Park and Greenwood Cemetery. On the cover, Klein is crouching, all sharp angles: hunched shoulders, bent elbows and knees. His bandmates, Rich Terrana, Chuck Patel and Preet Patel stand in a row to his left, upright, their jackets just as wrinkled at the joints as Klein's, just lived-in enough, the level of worn that comes from breaking them out for special occasions and big gigs. Their frontman's eyes are fixed to the ground, but Terrana and the Patels gaze at the lens, the vibe calmed by the violet rendering of the original photo.

The cover reflects the thought and care the Frightnrs have put into their streamlined, vintage sensibility that emerged as the Jamaica, Queens-based group found its footing in a scene shaped by ""years of ska-punk crossover and a lot of fake, white-rasta stage antics,"" as Klein put it. ""We wanted to come across as the Rat Pack,"" he said of the musicians' aesthetic and penchant for '70s rhythms that distanced them from their peers. ""We wanted to be sharp. We wanted to wear suits, be dark, get down to business, all 'This is New York.' We looked like a soul band, and we also enjoy a lot of Motown, doo-wop, blues and gospel music, and I think that comes out in our music.""

There's an effortless cool to the cover of Nothing More to Say that matches the music inside, and a discussion of this — of ""cool"" as a state of being, a vibe, a reflex or an instinct — brought an intense shine to Klein's eyes. ""Because of circumstances, this record is particularly significant, because it's going to be our only record,"" he said. ""Everybody wanted to make sure it's just right. It turns out we already had some pictures from last year that were very much appropriate for what we're going for. It didn't even occur to anybody that we'd want to use those. I'm really relieved. Those pictures were the right ones.""

That afternoon, Klein, having long since lost the ability to crouch the way he does on the album cover, was sitting upright thanks to the chair he now spent his days in, a position that facilitated breathing with the help of a machine that routinely filled his lungs. As he looked again at the artwork — which Gabe Roth, the founder of Klein's label, Daptone Records, had finalized just a few days before — the comment was made that the guys come off as the epitome of cool, that they don't even look like they're trying to nail the shot.

""Really?"" Klein paused. The machine clicked. He breathed. ""I'm trying really hard.""

Nothing More to Say was supposed to be a collection of triumphant firsts for the Frightnrs, for Daptone, for everyone involved in the project. It is the Frightnrs' first full-length album, and it follows three EPs, the most recent of them being Inna Lover's Quarrel, which Mad Decent put out last September. It is the first reggae album released by Daptone, the first deviation for the Bushwick-based label — best known for championing artists with hard-lived stories to tell, like Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and Charles Bradley — from its brassy, funk-laden foundation of soul (save for its recently launched rock imprint, Wick Records). It is the first record produced by Victor Axelrod, a.k.a. ""Ticklah,"" for the label, which is a doubly special event considering his close Daptone ties: An organist / piano player / man-on-the-keys of different persuasions and a prolific reggae composer based in Brooklyn, Axelrod has been around since the days before the Dap-Kings and Antibalas, back when members of both outlets played together as the Soul Providers in North Brooklyn in the late '90s.

It is also singular for being the first album Daptone will release following the death of one of the artists who made it.

On June 8, Klein, in spite of the concerns of his family and caregivers, went to Prospect Park to see Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings perform. Axelrod, who plays with the Dap-Kings for special occasions, joined them onstage that day, having heard about the difficult year Jones was having; she's in the process of battling cancer for the second time. Klein sent a simple ""Nicely done, sir!"" text to Axelrod following the gig. He succumbed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease, in the hours following the performance. The illness had first seeped into his muscles, making them feel strained and foreign, in the summer of 2015, just days after he and the Frightnrs began recording Nothing More to Say with Axelrod at Daptone's House of Soul studio.

""Things were moving along and going well, but there was this lingering issue of, 'What the hell is wrong with Dan? Why is he being such a drag?'"" Axelrod recalls in a conversation several weeks after Klein's death. ""It was during that week in the studio that his symptoms started to manifest to the point where he was really struggling to sing and was complaining about feeling lousy and weak the whole time. This continued for the rest of the summer into the fall, when we were recording his lead vocals, but it wasn't until the end of November that we all learned what was going on with him.""

ALS is a brutal and efficient disorder in which fatigue and weakness are eventually followed by loss of motor function and muscular degeneration, but its invasion of the body offers no exact timeline. Immediately following Klein's diagnosis, the Frightnrs, Axelrod and Daptone found themselves challenged on two fronts: by their own stubborn standards for creating a superlative record with Daptone's trademark throwback vibe, and by the mechanics it takes to do that on an intimidating and tragic deadline. From November onward, pressure forged the backbone of Nothing More to Say: The Frightnrs' time with Klein was finite, as was their opportunity to cut the record with Axelrod, and they needed to work through their anguish before Klein lost his ability to breathe, and to sing.

Axelrod says urgency was in the air long before anyone knew Klein was sick: Now that the Frightnrs, Axelrod and Daptone had found each other, they didn't want to wait to get Nothing More to Say out of the House of Soul and onto turntables. ""The profound change in the energy surrounding the album was that it went from the normal process of working on music to meet a label deadline to working on the album as quickly as possible in an attempt to have it released before Dan passed away,"" he says. ""It was a horrible feeling to work with. It felt ugly and surreal for all of us in the final months of completing the record. We got through it and did everything we needed to do. I just think it felt like we all had 50-pound weights strapped to our chests while we did it.""

Axelrod spent two days snaking wires and finagling mics to zero in on the time-traveling sound of Nothing More to Say. His microscopic approach to the technical minutiae isn't simply the process of a perfectionist: It's both reflective of Axelrod's commitment to a band he's believed in for years and an economical strategy, considering the suffocating deadlines and Klein's declining health. Through the window by the soundboard at the House of Soul, one can see into the recording room, where Klein cut his vocals in the same spot that Amy Winehouse sang her way through some of Back to Black's most beloved tracks and Sharon Jones gave voice to Give the People What They Want just before her own fight against a deadly illness nearly derailed her career.

""It's not uncommon to have very little time to record with a group of people and therefore rush through this initial process, only to have some possibly deep regrets later,"" Axelrod says of his meticulous preparations. ""I went into the studio with the idea that there would be a certain character to the sound of the record, which was to be established up front rather than on the back end. Everyone was patient with me, thankfully. The songs were all pretty new to everyone involved, so it was also a good way to just get settled in — for them to play a lot and go over the songs while I turned knobs.""

Axelrod saw the Frightnrs for the first time in 2011 at Otto's Shrunken Head, a tiki bar in the East Village that serves tropical drinks and hosts small shows in its back room. Their idiosyncrasies and instrumental flourishes struck him immediately. ""There were subtleties in their playing and the way they sang together that really resonated with me,"" he recalls. ""Dan's energy was simultaneously subdued and manic. He looked so uncomfortable with himself, but there was a sound that came from him that had everyone in the room mesmerized for the whole show.""

This sound, which harkens back to the soul-inflected stylings of '60s and '70s reggae, hit Axelrod's ear as informed and appreciative. This was hardly a band participating in musical tourism, but a band that lived and breathed vintage reggae — Alton Ellis, Delroy Wilson, Toots and the Maytals — and studied up on how these Jamaican singers were informed by the soulful hits coming out of Motown a decade prior, a tie that would later lay the foundation of its relationship with Daptone.

""There are all kinds of different rhythmic and textural approaches that are a part of the history of this genre, and it's not all late-'70s Bob Marley,"" Axelrod says. ""I could hear that the Frightnrs were loving and learning from different aspects of reggae that I also love and try to learn from. I can't say that about too many other groups of musicians. They're also a great example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. They know how to play together — with each other.""

It's easy to picture Axelrod staring down a stubborn microphone as he coaxes it into position to record Terrana's metallic cymbal hits or Patel's bobbing bass lines: The dual pulses of the rhythm section were stronger as a unit, and stronger still when recorded to the same track, even if it meant hours of additional setup time and a riskier endeavor to tackle in post, if need be. But it was Klein's voice — a resonant, somber tenor that took on the tone of a begging lover (""Gotta Find a Way""), a cheeky fighter (""Trouble In Here"") or a frustrated romantic whose best intentions have been defeated (""All My Tears"") — that stood out to Axelrod as a vital organ of Nothing More to Say.

""You'll notice there are no Jamaican accents on this record,"" Klein said in May, his Brooklyn lilt serving as a point of pride that further differentiates the Frightnrs from other like-sounding acts. ""I sing in my regular voice; I sing as an American."" Some singers belt and wail and give off the impression that these could be the last notes they ever sing. The intensity of Klein's delivery doesn't squander the sad truth that the notes heard on Nothing More To Say are, in fact, the last he would ever lay to tape. ""Despite the fact that his symptoms had taken hold by the time we began recording his vocals, I feel like, more than ever, Dan really found his voice as a singer and writer for this album,"" Axelrod says. ""I think the lyrics and melodies that Dan wrote for this album show the depth of his talent like never before.""

Klein was a part of the process up until his passing, checking in with Daptone to see about a confirmed release date and offering his insight on the tracks in mastering when he could bring himself to do so. ""I would check my emails sometimes, listen to things,"" he said. ""There were things that Victor would hear that I wouldn't; certain guys in my band would hear things. I don't have the same amazing ear for details. I was so desperate for the thing to be completed that I'd be more inclined to be like, 'That's awesome, let's go, let's go!' Half of me was overexcited and maybe not critical enough, and then the other half of me didn't want to listen to it because I didn't want to cry. There are songs on this album that I never got to sing in front of an audience. That's a bummer, you know? I'm really proud of it. I think we did a good job. We had the best help we could get.""

""I think everybody feels a certain onus as far as making this record happen,"" Roth says, sitting on the couch behind the engineer's chair at the House of Soul. He lives in Riverside, Calif., but was in New York in July on Daptone business, checking in with his staff, working on tracks for the forthcoming Sharon Jones album and surveying the pieces of the Nothing More to Say puzzle that had started coming together. On the morning of the Dap-Kings' Brooklyn gig five weeks prior, Roth had visited Klein in Windsor Terrace and told him that the album's release was confirmed for early September — later than they'd hoped, a result of overwhelmed vinyl pressing plants. ""I had to tell him that the record was coming out on Sept. 2,"" Roth says. ""He was a little disappointed by that. It was rough."" The announcement of the release date, the drop of the first song, the all-too-aptly named title track, the building buzz in the press — all are facets of the experience Klein missed, unfolding barely a month after his passing. ""I think that everyone top to bottom here feels like a certain sense of duty with that record,"" Roth continues. ""It's not just because Dan is gone; it's because it's such a beautiful record, and everybody feels like it's so important to get that record out to people. Obviously that task becomes a little more solemn. It feels a little more important. Mostly, it's very sad. But it's a great record, man.""

For Roth, the Frightnrs' commitment to the real deal is what made them a perfect addition to the label's roster. Klein, the Patels and Terrana looked to many of the same soul singers of the '60s and '70s for inspiration that Roth, Jones, the Dap-Kings and the Daptone roster at large have while building their reputation, and that kinship is rooted in more than old-school appreciation and well-worn suits.

""The way they're making music is the way we make music,"" Roth says. ""It's the same kind of love and respect, and soulful, not in the way of aping some style or trying to co-opt something that's not yours, but in the way of just being honest and making music that feels good and raw, stripping all the bulls*** out of the process, just systematically dismantling something until the only thing that's left is the real part of it. That, to me, is what that their record has. It has this real raw, naked kind of soul to it, which is what we aspire to as far as Daptone and the way we try to make records. The way that Victor recorded it, the way it's put together, it was just a lot of balls and a lot of heart, and not a lot of bulls***.""

Speaking to Klein in his final days, it was apparent he'd been thinking about what the album meant to him, especially now that he likely wouldn't live to see its release.

""The songs that I wrote were my personal stories of relationships and personal growth, and what I was going through before I knew I was sick,"" he said. ""I wish my relationship to the songs was that I can't wait to go sing them live on tour, opening for other Daptone acts. But now it's more what I'm leaving behind. It makes it more significant in that way.""

This is where a first chapter turns to a final one, where a debut becomes a legacy. The swift loss of life is devastating enough, but to extinguish the Frightnrs' run just as the flame of their success was beginning to spark feels especially, needlessly cruel on the part of fate. And yet, from the most difficult challenges one can face, Nothing More to Say emerged as a polished, seemingly effortless work of art. Though Klein's passing is deeply felt by those who knew him and the artists he counted as friends and family, the strength of the album, and knowledge of the superhuman determination it required to make it at such a breakneck pace, comfort in the wake of grief. Nothing More to Say is not just a premiere, not just a meticulously crafted and ruthlessly good record of unique reggae that could only be created by crate-digging kids that call the Queens County Jamaica home instead of the Caribbean one. It's an uppercut straight to the chin of mortality, thrown by some of the best musicians in the business.

Klein may have been trying really hard — during his cover photo shoot, during the vocal sessions he tracked with the clock running out — for the big break he didn't get to fully realize. But he wasn't alone."

How important is it for human beings to push new frontiers?

Is it just something that a few us are inclined toward — like searching out a new, untried restaurant rather than falling back on something familiar — or is it essential to our species' success? Could the need to take risks and expand into new territory be hardwired into our genetic make up? If so, does that mean expanding into space and the other worlds of our solar system is an imperative, rather than a luxury?

I recently finished astronomer Chris Impey's wonderful book Beyond: Our Future in Space. Impey begins with an account of the small bands of humans who left Africa some 70,000 years ago and went on — quickly — to settle the rest of the planet. As he puts it:

""Around 65,000 years ago, we first ventured out of the continent of our origin. The route from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula was probably across the Bab el-Mandeb strait. Today that strait is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes; at that time, after the last ice age had lowered sea levels, it was merely a narrow, shallow channel.""

The group that left was no more than a thousand or so in number, and they likely left in waves of smaller tribes. Within 20,000 to 30,000 years, they'd spread to Asia, Australia and Europe. By 16,000 years ago, they had made it across the land bridge of the Bering Sea to settle North and South America (though they may have crossed the ocean).

For Impey, this push across the planet is a testimony to a spirit of exploration and risk-taking that's built into the very fabric of bodies. Over the last few decades, researchers have identified what some have called the ""wayfarer gene."" It's known in scientific circles as DRD4 and its variant 7R. As David Dobbs describes it an excellent piece in National Geographic:

""...several studies tie 7R to human migration. The first large genetic study to do so, led by Chuansheng Chen of the University of California, Irvine in 1999, found 7R more common in present-day migratory cultures than in settled ones. A larger, more statistically rigorous 2011 study supported this, finding that 7R, along with another variant named 2R, tends to be found more frequently than you would expect by chance in populations whose ancestors migrated longer distances after they moved out of Africa.""

Of course no single gene can account for behavior. Environment and culture play equally important roles in determining human behavior. In his article, Dobbs describes the remarkable expansion of the Polynesians across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. That expansion was rapid, as long as the new islands to be settled were in visible range of those already inhabited. Once open ocean was reached, the expansion halted until émigrés from what is now South China provided the next boost in terms of a new technology — better ships. ""These boats were ships, really: long canoes with sails, outriggers, and far greater speed and range,"" Dobbs writes. With the technology, the Polynesians push onward — eventually reaching as far (perhaps) as the Americas.

So it would seem we are built for exploration — but it's not just in our genes. The wanderlust is also in our hands (for building) and our imaginations (for making new tools).

And why does any of this matter? Well, once again we are poised at the edge of a great sea. This time it's called space.

There are those who believe humanity needs a frontier. We need a horizon to focus our energies. We make heroes out of those who brave those frontiers — even if they do not return — because they act out something ancient and important in us.

That is why space matters. If we can navigate the bottleneck of sustainability and climate change lying directly in our path, then, once again, there will be new and distant shores awaiting us. While some say we need to clean up our act at home before we venture outward, the irony of the present moment may be that the two needs are linked.

We can only clean up our act here at home — meaning learning to live sustainably on this planet — because we discovered how planets work in our push outwards. All that space science gave us the much needed view (and understanding) of Earth's functioning as a planet in its full totality.

So, yes, it seems we were born to explore and push outwards. The combination of evolution and culture made us explorers and wanderers. Now — with so much to gain — we should recognize that explicitly and see exactly where our next frontier lies.

At our feet and far overhead.

KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill. So...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So we've managed to burn off 20 minutes of this terrible year, but we're not done yet. We shall show no mercy to 2016.

KURTIS: Time to bring out the big guns, namely Alonzo Bodden, Adam Felber and Amy Dickinson. Last April, we played a Bluff The Listener game about a problematic last name.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SAGAL: Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT...DON'T TELL ME.

REBECCA WARD: Hi, Peter. This is Rebecca Ward from Oakland, Calif.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Hey, how are things in Oaktown? We have some Oakland fans here, yes.

WARD: I see I've got some friends there. Things are great. It's beautiful here.

SAGAL: Oh, I know it is. Now, what do you do there in Oakland, home of artisanal and independent everything?

WARD: (Laughter). Yeah, actually I work in the South Bay.

(CHEERING)

WARD: Yeah, more people there. I'm a chef for a tech-related fruit company.

SAGAL: A tech-related fruit company?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I see.

AMY DICKINSON: Is it called Apple? No.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, welcome to the show, Rebecca. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is Rebecca's topic?

KURTIS: Hey there, what's your name?

SAGAL: Last names are great. They bond you to your family. They let you know if the person you're talking to is from one of the good countries. Well, this week, we read a story of someone's last name causing some unique problems. Our panelists are going to tell you about it. Guess the one who's telling the truth, you'll win our prize - Carl Kasell’s voice on your voicemail. Ready to play?

WARD: Oh, I'm so ready, yes.

SAGAL: Let's hear first from Alonzo Bodden.

ALONZO BODDEN: The LA Daily reports they found a Kardashian that isn't a Kardashian. Alyssa Kardashian has three problems - she lives in Hollywood, her name is Kardashian and she's not a member of the famous family. At first, it was kind of funny, Alyssa said. I mean, it's easy to get a reservation anywhere when a Kardashian calls. Unfortunately, a few years ago, the whole thing changed. Kardashian negativity started growing, and I was trapped in it. I had to shut down any and all social media. I had a Facebook page and a Twitter feed. But after receiving tons of unsolicited opinions and pictures, particularly from men who wanted to share their body parts, I had to shut all that down. It got so bad at point I thought of legally changing my name to Not That, so I could be Not That Kardashian.

(LAUGHTER)

BODDEN: My friends said to embrace it. You're legally a Kardashian - start taking selfies and asking for freebies. It's your name cash-in. It sounded like a great idea, and it might have worked, except once I started, I got a cease-and-desist order from the lawyers of the actual Kardashians telling me I'm not legally a Kardashian and not entitled to any profit from it. Now, I just wish they would tell their 10 million fans and haters I am not a Kardashian.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: A woman named Kardashian tries to be a Kardashian, but the Kardashians won't let her be a Kardashian. Your next story of a name ruining everything comes from Adam Felber.

ADAM FELBER: If you're into computers, you know that when you forget to fill out a required space in an online form, the computer invisibly fills in the word null and refuses to go forward until you put something in. And this works out great for everyone except for Virginia resident Mrs. Jennifer Null.

(LAUGHTER)

FELBER: See, null is something that's nothing to everyone, but it's not nothing to Null, whose online participation has been rendered null and void, or rather Null and therefore voided. It's complicated. Just as Mr. Null warned her when they got married, Jennifer Null finds herself in a world where she can't buy airline tickets, do her taxes or even make herself available for substitute teaching work without picking up a phone and wading through the system to speak to an actual human, who then gets to share in the horrific frustration. You'd think such a name would be a thing for Null to avoid, but apparently Mr. and Mrs. Null and all the little Nulls wouldn't have it any other way. And to be fair, it's probably better than her maiden name, Ms. Jennifer Punchmehard.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Your last story of someone's name making things difficult comes from Amy Dickinson.

DICKINSON: Uberto Car was born in Italy, but moved to San Francisco in the 1980s. He works in a bakery. In 2008, Car signed up for a Twitter account using his nickname, Uber, and his last name, Car. His Twitter handle is @ubercar. Uberto's problems began when Uber, the car-hiring service, started up in San Francisco. A zealous young employee at the young company mistakenly took Uberto's Twitter to be an official company and linked it to Uber.

Starting about three years ago, Uberto Car started receiving mysterious text messages from people demanding rides from him. Car told the San Francisco Chronicle, at first, I was like, what? I kept saying to people, I'm Uber Car, Uber Car. And they said, yeah, I know.

DICKINSON: I'm like, that's my name - Uber Car. I can make you a pancetta, but I don't want to drive you down to Fisherman's Wharf today.

SAGAL: All right, one of these was the name...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: ...That we saw in the news is causing trouble to someone. Was it from Alonzo Bodden, poor Alyssa Kardashian, who has to deal with the burden of that name, from Adam Felber, a woman named Jennifer Null who can't fill out online forms, or from Amy Dickenson, the saga of poor Uber Car, a man who isn't an Uber or a car, but is always mistaken for one?

WARD: Well, I do read Amy's column, and I take her advice, but I'm choosing Adam's story about Jennifer Null.

SAGAL: All right, you're going to choose Adam's story about poor Jennifer Null? Well, we actually spoke to someone with this name problem.

NULL: My last name, Null, means nothing. So when you put the word null into a field, systems will often see that as the field is blank.

SAGAL: That was Chris Null. He's a tech journalist and the owner of Null Media. And he is very familiar with the issues between his name and the Internet. Thank you so much because you got it right.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You did, in fact, pick Adam's story. He's the right one.

FELBER: Thank you.

SAGAL: You earned a point for him. You've won our prize. Carl Kasell will record the greeting on your voicemail. Well done. Congratulations.

WARD: Oh, that's so great. Thank you so much.

SAGAL: Bye-bye.

WARD: Bye-bye.

Would a President Donald Trump attempt to forcefully remove an estimated 11 million people from the United States?

Three days after Trump's campaign first hinted it was reconsidering walking back from a core campaign promise, the answer still isn't clear.

Trump had long promised to identify and remove the estimated 11 million immigrants already living in the United States illegally. He has called for a ""deportation force"" to do this, and notably praised a controversial Eisenhower administration-era program called ""Operation Wetback,"" which deported up to 1.5 million people from the United States.

But on Fox News Monday night, Trump appeared to walk back his praise for that initiative. ""I don't agree with that. I'm not talking about detention centers,"" Trump said. ""We are going to get rid of the bad ones. The bad ones will be out of here fast.""

Trump wouldn't say directly whether he was rethinking his mass deportation strategy, saying, ""I just want to follow the law.""

""The first thing we're going to do is going to, if and when I win, is we're going to get rid of all of the bad ones — we got gang members, we have killers, we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country. We're going to get them out.""

Trump compared his approach to deportations authorized by Presidents Obama and Bush. ""As far as everybody else, we're going to go through the process. What people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country. Bush, the same thing,"" Trump continued. ""Lots of people were brought out of the country with the existing laws. Well, I'm going to do the same thing.""

Focusing efforts on immigrants in the country illegally who have committed violent crimes, rather than an en-masse deportation effort, would be a policy much more in line with what Hillary Clinton is proposing than what Trump had previously touted.

Many experts have long questioned the logistical reality — if not humanitarian wisdom — of a large-scale effort to track down and deport every person already living in the country illegally.

Trump's interview with Fox host Bill O'Reilly comes during a period where his campaign has hinted at a shift in immigration policy, only to deny that any changes are taking place. Trump had been expected to roll out a new proposal later this week in Colorado, though that event has since been canceled.

Instead, Trump will tape a town hall event — also on Fox News — Tuesday night in Texas. The forum, moderated by Sean Hannity, is expected to focus on immigration."

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy says he's running once again for the presidency — years after a failed re-election bid that was seen as a rebuke to his leadership.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Concern over terror and security is shaping presidential elections, both here in the United States and also in France. And like here, long-familiar faces are competing in next year's vote, including a former president. From Paris, Jake Cigainero reports.

JAKE CIGAINERO, BYLINE: French media are calling the announcement the end of the false suspense. In his new book entitled ""Tout Por La France,"" everything for France, released this week, former President Nicolas Sarkozy writes, I have decided to be candidate for the presidential election in 2017. France demands that we give it everything. I felt that I had the strength to lead this fight in such a tormented time of our history.

Sarkozy has long been hinting that he would run.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NICOLAS SARKOZY: (Speaking French).

CIGAINERO: ""I will assemble a new team,"" he said in this speech last year, ""and promise to listen to everyone for what is needed for a better France."" Sarkozy lost his 2012 bid for re-election to current Socialist President Francois Hollande, who is now facing record-low popularity ratings. As leader of the center-right Republicans of France, Sarkozy has been an outspoken critic of Hollande. Brice Teinturier is with the the French polling institute.

BRICE TEINTURIER: (Speaking French).

CIGAINERO: ""His campaign could just be a repeat of his 2011 campaign,"" he says, ""about identity and immigration issues, which undeniably worry the French. If that's it, he will only perpetuate the Nicolas Sarkozy the French know."" For both Hollande's Socialists and Sarkozy's Republicans, the shared enemy is certain - Marine Le Pen's ultra-conservative, extreme right National Front, which after recent terror attacks in France is only gaining in popularity.

Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is known for his outspoken personality and oversize public image, which he believes help build his brand name.

""Whether it's good press or bad press, it's getting your name out there,"" Washington Post investigative reporter Michael Kranish tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. ""Getting your name on the gossip pages and the front pages and even the sports pages, [is] all in the effort of building the name.""

Kranish and his Post colleague Marc Fisher are the authors of Trump Revealed, a biography about Trump's life and career that is based on the work of more than 20 of the Post's reporters, editors and fact-checkers.

Fisher says 20 hours of interviews with Trump helped him come to a better understanding of the candidate. ""The man we've come to know and understand is someone who has led a strikingly solitary life given how public he is and how glad-handing his image is,"" Fisher said. ""When I asked him about friendships, he said he really doesn't have friendships of the kind that most people would describe.""

Interview Highlights

On what Trump was like as a kid

Marc Fisher: He was, by both his friends' description and his own, a rambunctious kid who got in trouble a lot and who was a bit of a ruffian. From the youngest age, about age 6 or 7, he pelted the neighbor's toddler with rocks from across the yard. He pulled the pigtails of a classmate. He got into a physical altercation with one of his teachers, and so he was someone who was kind of a rambunctious kid, even obnoxious by some accounts, and he says that he hasn't changed since second grade. So that kind of in-your-face provocateur character that we've come to see in the campaign is something that traces back very cleanly and consistently to this childhood as kind of a tough kid.

On how a lawsuit that charged his father's real estate company with racial bias influenced Trump's business philosophy

Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

Michael Kranish: This was a very serious lawsuit, one of the most significant racial bias cases at the time, and it's very interesting. We were able to obtain, under Freedom of Information Act requests, all of the transcripts for this court case. What happened was, Donald had to decide, was he going to settle this case or was he going to fight the federal government? One night in Manhattan he walked into a nightclub that he belonged to, and there was a man named Roy Cohn, and Roy Cohn of course is the famous or infamous lawyer who was the aide to Joseph McCarthy of the Army-McCarthy hearings that was held in the 1950s. Donald got to talking to Roy Cohn and told him about this racial bias case brought by the federal government, and Cohn, who himself had fought the federal government many times in his career, said: ""Don't settle. Fight like hell. When they hit you, hit back 10 times harder.""

The bottom line is, after this discussion at the nightclub, Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

On Trump using a pseudonym to be his own press agent

Fisher: So what happened is in an effort to kind of spread his image around the city and around the country eventually, Donald Trump would act as his own press agent. He would call reporters as ""John Miller"" or ""John Barron,"" he wouldn't bother even to disguise his voice, but he would call them up and say, ""Donald Trump is going to be out at this club with this amazing celebrity or this model,"" or ""Donald Trump is going to be groundbreaking for a new building."" And he would kind of gin up press coverage as this alter ego, and he would also call reporters to complain about their stories or to encourage them to think about Donald Trump in a better light. ...

Some of the reporters who got these calls knew that it was Trump, and they thought this was kind of weird, but they went along with it; others didn't know. We were lucky enough to get a recording that someone sent me of one of these calls in which he presents himself as John Miller to a reporter for People magazine and if you listen to the recording, it sounds astonishingly like Donald Trump because it is Donald Trump. He carries this on as if no one knows what his very distinctive voice sounds like, and he talks about Donald Trump in this very extremely complimentary way and about what a ladies' man he is, and how women can't stop themselves from coming to him and seeking to go out with him, and this is something that he did for many, many years.

On Trump's debt in the 1990s

Kranish: [The banks] really felt that if they basically forced Donald Trump to repay his debts that they were going to lose everything themselves. Donald Trump had such extraordinary leverage that there came a day when the bankers were concerned that Donald Trump did not have insurance on his yacht, which he bought for some $20 million. Trump's associates basically told the bank, ""Look, you need to pay for the insurance on the yacht, because if something happens to it, you'll have nothing."" He eventually got the bank to pay insurance that Donald Trump himself didn't have. Similarly, Donald Trump had five helicopters the banks wanted to take back. For a time, he actually hid those five helicopters, because he was concerned they'd be swept up by the banks. Eventually they were turned over, but it just shows you the difficult times that Donald Trump was having at that time.

On Trump's business model of selling his name and his image

Fisher: Over time, what Donald Trump learned was that he could do all these things for himself. So the big question is, is he capable of doing this for anyone other than himself? And the track record really makes me kind of skeptical about that, because what we have is someone who, throughout his career, has found ways to enrich himself at the expense of others.

What Donald Trump learned from that experience in New York and Atlantic City was that he could build his entire business model around this idea of selling his image and his name. The more he got people to believe that his image was worth millions, the more he would be able to go out and sell just his name. So many of his latter day projects over the last couple of decades, in fact most of them, do not involve Donald Trump building anything, do not involve Donald Trump creating jobs, they involve Donald Trump going to a developer and saying, ""I will sell you my name that you can put on your building that you have invested in, with your money, and that you will give me a steady, guaranteed income flow."" That's the arrangement he had on many if not most of his building projects in the United States and around the world that have been done in the last 10, 20 years, and similarly with all the other businesses that he's gotten into, whether it's selling medicines or selling a university that he created. All of these things are cases where his involvement on a day-to-day basis is marginal or even nonexistent — what he's sold is the name, and he gets a set multimillion-dollar fee every year that's guaranteed, even if the project fails."

The Obelisk Gate is the second book in a trilogy that makes me forget everything people say about second books in trilogies. By rights it should be full of the things we forgive middle books: necessary stalling; development of characters less interesting than in the first volume but nevertheless plot-critical; all the weary setup of scaffolding from which to launch the finale.

But it isn't. If anything it's even more engrossing than The Fifth Season, picking up right where that first book left off and plunging us deep into the Evil Earth and all its machinations. Not only could I not put it down — I couldn't come up for air long enough to comment on it while forsaking sleep and food in order to finish it.

Spoilers for The Fifth Season will of course follow — these are not stand-alone books by any means. If anything they feel like one smooth story, broken, Scheherezade-like, at their most compelling points.

In the world of the Stillness, earthquakes occur with such devastating frequency that their aftermath is called a Fifth Season: a season of ashy skies, boiled oceans, fauna and flora that change their behavior in accordance with the vicious atmosphere. The world has lasted this long because of orogenes, people born with the ability to manipulate thermodynamics such that they can quell shakes and divert disaster. But orogenes are a feared and oppressed minority among the so-called stills, kept in check by Guardians who can resist and disrupt their power.

We last saw Essun — who was Syenite, who was Damaya — living underground in a strange crystal-ridden community called Castrima, learning that her old friend, mentor and lover, Alabaster — the most powerful orogene in the Stillness — is responsible for the current Season. Drawing power from the incomprehensible obelisks that float in the skies, he tore the continent apart trying to use their power to break the sick social order and begin the enormous work of ending the terrible cycle of Seasons.

But the cost of using the obelisks is high. Alabaster is slowly turning into stone, and Essun needs to learn all she can from him if she's to complete the work he began, and end the Seasons once and for all. The short time they have together is troubled: Enemies press Castrima on all sides, threatening the fragile peace between orogenes and stills. And somewhere in the world, Essun's lost daughter is coming into her own immense orogenic power, undergoing a strange and dangerous education of her own.

Beyond the meticulous pacing, the thorough character work, and the staggering ambition and revelations of the narration, Jemisin is telling a story of our present, our failures, our actions in the face of repeated trauma, our responses to the heat and pressure of our times.

This book is riveting. I can say with authority that the transition from The Fifth Season is seamless, because I read the books back to back and already have trouble remembering which events were in each; I can't even fathom what it must have been like for readers to finish The Fifth Season without having The Obelisk Gate nearby to dive into. Except I can, a little — The Obelisk Gate ends at the edge of another precipice, but it is less a lightning strike of shock than it is a gathering of clouds, a crackling of building static to burst in The Season of Stillness next year.

It feels in many ways presumptuous and patronizing to applaud the maturation of a writer's work, as if I, the reviewer, stand beyond some literary finish line prepared to award a novelist her laurels. But I don't know how else to speak to the awe I feel, having followed the unfolding of The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms series — which I thoroughly enjoyed — into this. Every insight is deeper, every observation sharper. Beyond the meticulous pacing, the thorough character work, and the staggering ambition and revelations of the narration, Jemisin is telling a story of our present, our failures, our actions in the face of repeated trauma, our responses to the heat and pressure of our times. Her accomplishment in this series is tremendous. It pole vaults over the expectations I had for what epic fantasy should be and stands in magnificent testimony to what it could be.

The Obelisk Gate is dedicated ""To those who have no choice but to prepare their children for the battlefield."" With these books, Jemisin facets diamonds out of the hot mess of our world.

The administrator of FEMA answers three questions about Zima, a terrible alcoholic beverage from the 1990s and an actual Federal Emergency. Originally broadcast May 28, 2016.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Lastly, let's listen back to an interview that is on point for a disaster of a year. We talked to Craig Fugate, who runs the Federal Emergency Management Agency back in May. And I asked him about his qualifications for the job.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

CRAIG FUGATE: Yeah, I trained as a professional firefighter and paramedic early in my career.

SAGAL: Right, so you actually went to - they call it fire college? Is that like a four-year university where things are constantly on fire?

FUGATE: No, it's about 200 hours of learning how not to burn.

SAGAL: I understand.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Now – and so you trained your way up. You were a firefighter, an EMT and then you were seriously - you were in charge of the Florida Department of Emergency Management or something, the equivalent? Is that right?

FUGATE: I was director of emergency management, most notably in 2004, when we were hit by four hurricanes in one year.

SAGAL: Yeah, I was about to say you didn't take it easy on yourself. You picked Florida.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That state is basically one rolling disaster.

FUGATE: Yeah, it gets kind of interesting down there...

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

FUGATE: ...Particularly when you have the alligators and everything else.

SAGAL: Really? Do you ever have to - do you have any part of your organization that tries to anticipate disasters that haven't happened yet?

FUGATE: Oh, yeah - geomagnetic storms, your asteroids coming out of space, space debris…

SAGAL: You practice for asteroids crashing?

FUGATE: Yeah.

SAGAL: So do you do this any other way than watching, like, ""Armageddon"" over and over again?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: And if the asteroid comes, do you have to be like Bruce Willis and go up there and blow it up yourself?

FUGATE: No, we have people for that.

SAGAL: I understand.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

ROXANNE ROBERTS: I - this is Roxanne. I have a question for you. Do you travel - do you go to a lot of these various sites?

FUGATE: Yeah, and that's generally a bad sign. If I show up, it's not good.

SAGAL: Right. You did invent something we found out called the Waffle House index.

FUGATE: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

FUGATE: That came out of the '04 hurricanes.

SAGAL: Could you tell us what the Waffle House index is?

FUGATE: Sure. If the Waffle House is open, everything's good. If the Waffle House is open...

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

LUKE BURBANK: Heck of a job, Fugey (ph)...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No, I read about this, an article that basically the theory is, like, Waffle Houses are the cockroaches of the restaurant industry. They cannot be killed.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So the first thing that happened...

FUGATE: They are open most of the time. And that was the index. If a Waffle House is closed because there's a disaster, it's bad. We call it red. If they're open but have a limited menu, that's yellow because they lost power...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, all right, and if they have regular menu, you just - it's everything's fine.

FUGATE: If they're green, we're good, keep going. You haven't found the have bad stuff yet.

SAGAL: Yeah – come up with that.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: I have one more question before we go to the game. Have you guys in all your war gaming and planning thought about what you would do in the zombie apocalypse?

FUGATE: Yeah, we want everybody to download the FEMA app so we can get you instructions on what to do if there's a zombie outbreak.

SAGAL: Oh, I should mention - I forgot to mention that FEMA is now - you're as hip as Tinder.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: There is an app. And we don't want people trying to - like, we don't want people - if, like, the flood waters are rising to their neck, you don't want them holding up their phone and trying to download the app then. You want them to do it now.

FUGATE: Yeah, or use a selfie stick and stand up on high ground.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You are a practical man with a tool bag filled with solutions. Well, Craig Fugate, what a pleasure to talk to you. It's somewhat comforting to know you're out there looking out for us. We have asked you here to play a game we're calling...

KURTIS: FEMA Meet Zima.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You run FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, so we're going to ask you about Zima, a terrible beverage from the 1990s.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: And as it happens, an actual federal emergency.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Answer two of these three questions right and you will win our prize for one of our listeners - Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Craig Fugate playing for?

KURTIS: Jesse Cox from Louisville, Ky.

SAGAL: Now, I have to ask - you seem of an age - do you remember Zima?

FUGATE: I have no idea what it was.

SAGAL: Ah. So what it basically was the sort of clear beverage that tasted like bad Sprite mixed with vodka. And it ended up being a terrible failure. But here's your first question - in its first year, they sold millions and millions of cases. But then what happened? A, an urban myth went around saying it was made of Kool-Aid and rubbing alcohol, B, stores stocked it in the soda pop section where drinkers could not find it, or C, people actually tasted it?

(LAUGHTER)

FUGATE: Oh, Cs too easy. It's got to be B.

SAGAL: No, it was actually C.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Always go for the cruel answer here, sir. It's a tip. What happened was driven by these amazing advertisements, people flocked to buy it. They sold a million cases - or a million barrels, I should say. And then people drank it and sales plummeted.

All right, you still have two more chances. Despite the fact that it tasted pretty bad, sales did continue for a while based in part on what false rumor? A, that drinking enough of it could instantly make you able to speak Japanese, B, that it was an excellent solvent for removing dried gum and tar, or C, that no matter how much you drank, you could still pass a breathalyzer test?

FUGATE: I would go with frat boy C.

SAGAL: You're right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: Although it wasn't frat boys.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Apparently, it was a rumor among high school students that breathalyzers could not detect a Zima drunk.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: They were wrong.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, if you get this last one right, you will win our prize. Coors finally pulled the plug on Zima, stopped production in 2008. And then there was this movement to bring it back - bring back Zima, Coors. But what happened to that movement? A, the leader of the movement, a young woman from South Carolina, admitted she never actually tasted it but liked the name, B, nobody came to the meetings because the only beverage served there was Zima...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ...Or C, an online petition out of the million needed got 850 signatures.

FUGATE: Let's go with C.

SAGAL: You're right...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: ...Mr. Fugate.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: It was the million man march to bring back Zima, and only 850 sad people showed up. So it didn't happen.

BURBANK: Their other support group - Zalcoholics Zanonymous also never took off.

SAGAL: No, I guess not. Bill, how did Craig Fugate do on our quiz.

KURTIS: No disaster here. Craig, you got two right. And in our books, that is a win.

SAGAL: Congratulations.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Craig Fugate is the head of FEMA. And you can find the new FEMA app in the app store of your choice now. Get it before the next disaster hits you. Craig Fugate, thank you so much for joining us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

Courtney Marie Andrews, 'Rookie Dreaming'

from Honest Life

Somehow, between being born in Arizona in 1990 and moving to Washington in 2011, singer, songwriter and guitarist Courtney Marie Andrews seems to have spent time in early-'70s Laurel Canyon. Her new, self-produced album Honest Life is evidence; while she keeps company with some wonderful contemporary artists, Andrews channels classic icons beautifully. The throwback-folk perfection of the opening track, ""Rookie Dreaming,"" is typical of the entire collection. With an unhurried lyrical cadence set against a sparse sonic backdrop, Andrews sets the scene of what has been: ""I was a 1960s movie / I was a one-night love story / I was a 'You will never see me again.'"" Here, the singer gazes into a pool of self-reflection, looking earnestly for reckoning and redemption. Three minutes later, shuffling drums and stacked vocals have come and gone as she flips the script to what she's become: ""I am a 1960s movie / I am an unwritten story / I am a 'When will I see you again?'"" Musing her way through the evolution, she emerges with new-found maturity as she confesses the transgressions behind her: ""I was too broke, too shallow to dive deep / Too busy carrying the weight of everything.""

Jean-Baptiste ""Toots"" Thielemans, the Belgian-American musician who cut a singular path as a jazz harmonica player, died in his sleep Monday in his hometown of Brussels. He was 94.

He began his professional career as a guitar player (and added the ability to whistle a line above it), but inspired by the mid-20th-century innovations of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, he returned to the chromatic harmonica and developed a bebop-influenced technique on it. He performed and recorded widely with his bebop heroes and many other stars of postwar jazz, and his tune ""Bluesette"" quickly became a jazz standard. His work also graces many film and television scores.

Thielemans' first instrument was actually the accordion; he was a child entertainer in the Brussels sidewalk cafe run by his parents. As a teenager, he took up harmonica and guitar, but he still didn't dream of music as a career.

""Being a musician was not really a profession, so you needed to try to get a diploma,"" he told Marian McPartland for a 2005 episode of Piano Jazz. He pursued a degree in mathematics instead. ""But Louis Armstrong changed all that.""

He had heard jazz, and it became his passion, playing along to radio broadcasts of swing bands and, later, bebop. However, the harmonica was and is still best-known as a blues or folk instrument — or a toy — and he faced an uphill battle for acceptance.

""And the musicians say, 'Hey, you could be a good musician, you know,' "" Thielemans said on a 1997 episode of NPR's Jazz Profiles. "" 'But throw this away, get a real instrument.' So that's how I became a guitar player.""

In 1948, he visited the U.S. for the first time and sat in on a few jam sessions. He caught the ear of an agent for star clarinetist Benny Goodman, who invited Thielemans to join Goodman on a European tour.

From there, Thielemans was off and running. He moved to the U.S. and joined pianist George Shearing's popular quintet for five years, and he freelanced with many jazz greats. He described his style for Jazz Profiles:

""It's like a painting with a lot of pastel colors,"" he said. ""It's not red, it's not black — it's some of those tones in between. ... So between plus, between minus, between happy and not-so-happy."" He demonstrated on the song ""You Don't Know What Love Is."" ""A tear comes quickly to me, or a smile, you know. That's where my music is, I guess.""

As the 1960s dawned, he added another trick to his bag. Inspired by singing bassist Slam Stewart, he started whistling in unison with his guitar. It's showcased on the original recording of his tune ""Bluesette,"" which soon became an international hit.

The device caught the ears of fans — and more. Thielemans became a first-call studio musician for top arrangers like Quincy Jones. His harmonica graced the theme song for Sesame Street and the score for the movie Midnight Cowboy. And that's his whistling in the commercial jingle for Old Spice toiletries.

Jazz remained his first love; even toward the end of his career, he would begin every morning with practice on the complex changes to John Coltrane's ""Giant Steps."" Harmonica player Howard Levy says Thielemans kept pushing himself to expand his musical vocabulary in an emotionally compelling way.

""Toots was a transcendent musician,"" Levy says. ""If he had picked up any other instrument he would have been just as great. ... He was really playing music through the harmonica rather than playing the harmonica.""

He suffered a stroke in his 60s, which limited his facility for playing the guitar, but he continued touring. He was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in the U.S., and a baron by the king of Belgium. And he only retired from performing at the age of 92."

Then You Must Tell Listeners

If you use Skype to interview a guest and some of the conversation gets into a piece or two-way, then you need to say that you used Skype.

There are various ways to do it, including:

- “We reached her on Skype.”

- “She spoke to us on Skype.”

- “He joins us on Skype.”

Give the credit once before you cut to the clip or go to the conversation. Treat this just like those mandatory credits to networks on debate nights. It’s part of the deal when you download and use Skype.

Meanwhile, check the terms of service of any similar Internet service you use. Google’s voice and video chat services, for instance, do not require these credits – and may be alternatives you’d like to explore.

Business leaders worry that designating neighborhoods as hot zones will hurt tourism. State and local officials are concerned about how information is being released about Zika's spread.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

In Miami, business leaders and local and state officials all are struggling to cope with the impact of Zika. Just last month, the first case of Zika transmitted locally in the U.S. was confirmed in Miami's Wynwood neighborhood. Now health officials confirm that mosquitoes are carrying the disease in Miami Beach, accounting for at least five cases there. NPR's Greg Allen has been following efforts to control Zika in Florida and joins us now from Miami. Good morning.

GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Morning, Renee.

MONTAGNE: Let's start with the latest numbers.

ALLEN: Up to now, we have 37 locally transmitted cases. Those are most likely all from mosquito bites. Related - those cases are mostly related to two areas. One is, as you say, in the Wynwood neighborhood - one mile square area - just north of Miami's downtown. That we've had for nearly a month now. On Friday, we heard from health officials there's a second area now. And this one is right in the heart of the tourism area - Miami Beach. It's a one-and-a-half-square-mile area. And there's five cases there, as you say. But those could be just the beginning. There are several other areas under investigation, isolated cases at this point. But health officials are looking at those.

MONTAGNE: And generally speaking, how are people there handling it?

ALLEN: Well, it really depends on who you're talking about. It's a very difficult time to be pregnant in Miami. We hear stories of women who really just will not step outside now because of the fear of what could happen with one mosquito bite. I've even heard of women who've missed their appointments with their OBGYN's because they're so worried about going out. For many other people though, I think it's - there's a lot of - a very low level of concern. I talked to students going to school yesterday. Kids were happy to be going back to school, not that concerned about mosquito bites, wearing their bug spray. But the issue there is that if enough - other people get infected, possible that the disease could be spread further. And so that's a concern.

MONTAGNE: And obviously there are efforts to control the mosquitoes that carry Zika. How effective are they proving to be?

ALLEN: Well, this mosquito, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is proving harder to control than I think many had expected. One reason is they found that it's resistant, down here in Florida, to some pesticides, especially the ones they've been using to spray by hand. The CDC encouraged the health department and mosquito control officials here to consider aerial spraying. They've done that with some success. They really knocked down the populations of mosquitoes in that Wynwood area.

But after a month of this, business owners there are really feeling the pinch and are starting to talk about - seeing their business down by 50 to 60 percent. And we heard yesterday, at a roundtable that the governor had here in Miami, a lot of pressure from business leaders to consider doing away with the maps and the boxes that are on the maps that kind of outline these hot zones. Here's what Florida's surgeon general had to say when she was asked about the box around Wynwood and when it could be lifted.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CELESTE PHILIP: The current language suggests that we would wait 45 days, which is three incubation periods. But we are in the process of discussing if there might be some flexibility.

ALLEN: Florida health officials are following the CDC guidelines about what areas are designated as these hot zones, these zones of active transmission. And many here aren't happy about how large those zones are and how long they're likely to stay in place.

MONTAGNE: And what about Miami Beach - as you pointed out, a big tourist area? Is it starting to lose business?

ALLEN: Well, so far, no, it's been much the same as we saw in the other neighborhood, the Wynwood neighborhood. The first weekend there after the announcement, there was a very low level of concern. The visitors packed in as usual. But over time, what you find is people start to change their travel plans. At least, that's what's happened there. There is concern that could happen at Miami Beach.

And the tensions had begun to show last week, when the news leaked that health officials were going to designate that area in Miami Beach as the second active transmission area. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine said there was possibly two cases. And then the next day, the governor said there were five. And officials were miffed that they were kind of blindsided by this. That's led to some hard feelings. We heard about them yesterday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PHILIP LEVINE: I hope that after this meeting we can be assured by you and by your team that we will get information as fast as possible.

RICK SCOTT: I just want to assure everybody. Whatever information comes out from the governor's office or the department of health will be timely. And it'll be accurate.

ALLEN: That was Mayor Levine and then Governor Scott - little hard feelings there between a Republican and a Democrat.

MONTAGNE: Right. Greg, thanks very much.

ALLEN: You're welcome.

MONTAGNE: That's NPR's Greg Allen in Miami.

The Hike by Drew Magary Hardcover, 278 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

You know what they don't make a lot of? Summer beach books for dudes.

I mean, okay. If you like crime novels, sure. There are always 10,000 of those slumping on the shelves. Military techno/spy WE-ONLY-HAVE-24-HOURS-TO-SAVE-THE-KENTUCKY-DERBY-FROM-ESKIMO-TERRORISTS!-style thrillers? Yeah, I guess there are some of those, too.

But what I'm saying here is that there aren't enough books with hovercrafts. With dwarf-fights. Books for guys who don't care about the specific technical details of the next generation of main battle tanks, but do have bad knees and softening guts, families, jobs, and the vague feeling that somewhere along the way we gave up something big that we didn't understand for a small victory we understand even less.

Here's the good news: Now there is one. It's called The Hike and it's written by Drew Magary (who you might know from GQ, from Deadspin, or from his appearance on the cooking show Chopped, where he played the part of a doofus in a polo shirt so perfectly that it's like he really is just some doofus in a polo shirt). He's the guy who makes fun of your favorite football teams online. Who gleefully destroys children's programming in essays full of bad words and excellent analogies. Who has already written a couple other books, but has now turned his hand to deconstructing (and then maybe having a few drinks and a half-tab of acid before re-constructing) the traditional fairy tale for this weird, modern age in which we live.

It begins with Ben — a man who has a job that's so boring I can't even recall exactly what it was. Ben is 38. He has a wife and three kids in Maryland, but as the tale opens, he has come to a faded country hotel in rural Pennsylvania for some sort of business meeting.

More Drew Magary

He arrives early (because Ben is the kind of guy who would do that) and checks in and decides to go for a short hike (because Ben is also the kind of guy who would do that). Not a run. He's a bit past that. But just a little walk in the woods.

Which is when his entire universe comes un-stuck at the seams.

First thing I loved about The Hike? It happens so fast, this unsticking. And when that moment comes, it's brutal.

""And then he saw the man: a big, hulking man wearing a denim shirt and cheap jeans, dragging a body out of the shed. The corpse was small and clad in a little cupcake nightgown. Her feet were gone.""

It goes on. It gets worse. It is precisely as shocking and disorienting as it's supposed to be. There's a chase, a great and believable narrow escape, panic, tears, barfing, a giant cricket.

Yes, a giant cricket. Ben has to fight one. In the attic of a creepy, empty house in the middle of nowhere. With a cheese knife. And that isn't even the weirdest thing that happens on that page because after the cricket comes the talking, grumpy, foul-mouthed crab (named Crab) who becomes Ben's only friend.

What Magary is playing with here (beyond fairy tales, beyond an 8-bit videogame structure of puzzle-item-reward that is predictable but as nostalgically comforting as the shape of a Nintendo controller in the hand) are themes of regret, resilience and dedication.

What Magary is playing with here (beyond fairy tales, beyond an 8-bit videogame structure of puzzle-item-reward that is predictable but as nostalgically comforting as the shape of a Nintendo controller in the hand) are themes of regret, resilience and dedication. There is a path. Ben has to stay on it or he will die. There's an ambiguous promise that if he does this, he will (someday) make it back to his wife and children. Nothing else is given, or even offered (except the occasional lobster dinner).

And look, the whole thing is wildly uneven and sometimes frustratingly basic. There's a drooping middle segment that would've worked fine as a second-act training montage in an eighties movie, but dragged things down on the page. But still, The Hike just works. It's like early, good Chuck Pahlaniuk leeched of all bitterness and class warfare — back when Chuck was still weird and tired and furious. It's like a story you tell yourself on a long drive alone in the dark. It's fun and fast and bizarre, familiar yet completely other.

But the real kicker? Magary underhands a twist in at the end that hits you like a sharp jab at the bell. You'll see stars, I promise, but I don't want to come within a million miles of spoiling for you. It's just that good.

So like Ben, you're just going to have to earn it by getting to the end of the path yourself.

We were prepared to issue another rant about clichés this morning after hearing during the 6 a.m. ET Newscast that hailstones ranging in size from “grapefruits to softballs” fell in Dallas on Monday. Can’t we find some other comparisons?

We were also prepared to complain that grapefruits and softballs are basically the same size, so there really wasn’t a “range.”

But, as she sometimes is, Korva was on to something. NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center has posted a “traditional object-to-size conversion for assessment and translation of severe hail reports.”

Based on the diameters (in inches), here are NOAA’s conversions:

0.50 … marble or moth ball

0.75 … penny

0.88 … nickel

1.00 … quarter

1.25 … half dollar

1.50 … walnut or ping pong ball

1.75 … golf ball

2.00 … hen egg

2.50 … tennis ball

2.75 … baseball

3.00 … tea cup

4.00 … grapefruit

4.50 … softball

Thus, it appears there is official paperwork that blesses weather-worn clichés about hail. And as you see, there’s official word confirming there is a (slight) range between grapefruits and softballs.

However, the fight against clichés will continue. Previous posts:

– No, Virginia, It ‘Tisn’t The Season

– Let’s Toss ‘Hat In The Ring’ Into The Cliché Round File

– We Wave A Lot; Perhaps We Should Stem The Tide

Jonathan Kern’s thoughts about cliches are also worth rereading:

Cliches and shopworn phrases: “This decision comes in the wake of a ruling last week,” “the long-simmering dispute has provoked a storm of controversy,” “investors have been taken for a wild ride by the roller coaster stock market,” “public school teachers are leaving in droves” – these are just a few examples of the hundreds of modular phrases journalists use to write with a minimum of effort. It’s understandable: the reporters and news writers are under deadline pressure, and these are the phrases that spring to mind. The editor’s job is not to let them get away with it.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

There's an interview we did on the show earlier this year that whenever someone brings it up, it's hard not to laugh. Robert did this one. And if you didn't hear it the first time or even if you did, enjoy. Here you go.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Jon Benjamin is a comedian and voice actor best known for playing the title roles on the animated series ""Bob's Burgers"" and ""Archer."" He's also the voice of a can of vegetables in the movie ""Wet Hot American Summer."" He's been a comedian for more than 20 years. And none of that is why we've invited him on the show. We have him here because of the most public radio of reasons. He has recorded an experimental jazz album.

JON BENJAMIN: Thank you for having me.

SIEGEL: You recorded this album with three other musicians - a bass player, a drummer and a saxophonist. You're on piano.

BENJAMIN: Yep.

SIEGEL: And I want us to listen to some of this track.

BENJAMIN: I really can't, and it really shows.

SIEGEL: (Laughter) And yet here you are...

BENJAMIN: Yeah.

SIEGEL: Playing with some guys who seem to know what they're doing.

BENJAMIN: They were very accomplished jazz musicians that I played with - and me.

SIEGEL: The name of this album is, ""Well, I Should Have"" subtitle ""Learned How To Play Piano.""

BENJAMIN: Yeah, it's very literal.

SIEGEL: Now, you're playing with professional jazz musicians - Scott Kreitzer on sax, David Finck on bass, and Jonathan Peretz is playing drums. Was this an act of friendship or just a measure of the jazz economy that you got to do whatever gig comes along?

BENJAMIN: They were very nice to do it, and I'm not sure they realized what they were doing till we got there. And then they were mad but not mad enough to stop all together. So they went through it, and they were great.

SIEGEL: Yeah. He knows what he's doing, yeah.

BENJAMIN: He really does.

SIEGEL: Yeah.

BENJAMIN: But that's just not as interesting.

SIEGEL: I think it lacks the complete sense of free-form surprise that we have...

BENJAMIN: Well, it's funny. I've been asked a couple times, but I'm not sure I want to do that. I'm really going to dedicate myself to learning how to play, and maybe my next album will be decent.

SIEGEL: Is that right? Are you trying to learn how to play?

BENJAMIN: I've started taking lessons, so...

SIEGEL: (Laughter) I see. You're sort of charting a reverse career which begins with the recording contract...

BENJAMIN: (Laughter) It's a real insult to people who try.

SIEGEL: ...And then eventually makes its way to actual lessons on the instrument.

BENJAMIN: I mean, look; I've - there's a distinct possibility that I'll be very good.

SIEGEL: (Laughter).

BENJAMIN: I don't know, like, how it's going to turn out. I just started doing the lessons, so I might be incredibly good.

As a new school year gets underway, the Common Core remains a partisan flashpoint, while Americans overall have serious concerns about the direction of our public education system. That's according to two new polls.

Education Next, a policy journal, released its 10th annual large national poll of public opinion on education today. And Gallup, the polling organization, has recently released new figures as well.

With results broken out along partisan lines, the polls also provide insight into trends that may affect the current presidential campaign.

Here's a roundup of key findings:

Common Core: Like the idea, hate the name

EdNext says support for the Common Core State Standards, the K-12 math and English standards initially adopted in 45 states, has plummeted in a relatively short time. In 2012, the first year EdNext asked about them, 90 percent of those who had an opinion favored the standards. This year, the number had sunk to 50 percent.

Enlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

""The decline in Common Core support is largely due to two factors,"" says Lorraine McDonnell, a professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has conducted her own studies of public opinion on Common Core. ""One, respondents' limited knowledge of what it is and who is responsible for it. And, two, its politicization by Tea Party adherents, the testing opt-out movement and some political candidates.""

A quick search of the hashtag #commoncore on Twitter turns up negative posts from both ends of the political spectrum, including from self-described Trump supporters.

But there's an interesting wrinkle in these results.

When you ask Americans how they feel about ""the use of the same standards across states,"" two-thirds say they approve. That figure has also declined in the past four years, but not as dramatically.

Of course ""the same standards across states"" is basically the definition of Common Core. Republicans seem especially allergic to the Common Core ""brand."" When the name is mentioned, approval plummets 22 points; the difference is 10 points for Democrats.

McDonnell observes that for more than 15 years, even before Common Core was introduced, many surveys, like this one, have found support for cross-state or national standards. ""[Those terms] are concrete and understandable to the public and largely untinged by political rhetoric.""

Growing red state-blue state divides

Partisan divides on education policy are wide. But they can be unpredictable.

In the Gallup poll, just 32 percent of Republicans approve of the nation's K-12 education system, while 53 percent of Democrats feel the same. Just two years ago, both were tied at 48 percent approval. Gallup authors suggest that Common Core rhetoric is part of the reason.

EdNext found that 74 percent of Republicans now back charter schools, compared with just 58 percent of Democrats — still a strong majority, although Democratic-leaning interest groups Black Lives Matter and the NAACP have both recently called for a moratorium on new charter schools. On the other hand, Dems are now more likely than Republicans to favor school vouchers and tuition tax credits for public schools, both traditional GOP proposals.

Up close looks better than far away

Another result worth highlighting: In the EdNext poll, Americans' opinions of their local public schools have risen considerably over the past decade. More than half — 55 percent — give the school in their community an ""A"" or ""B"" rating, compared with just 43 percent a decade ago.

It's hard to find an empirical reason for this warming of opinion. Student performance, at least as measured by test scores, isn't improving.

Still, there may be a sense that ""schools are evolving and changing,"" says Maria Ferguson, executive director of the nonpartisan Center on Education Policy. ""All this talk about innovation may be getting into the water. For me as a parent of two kids in school, the Common Core, for example, has been positive.""

However, public opinion of the nation's schools overall, as opposed to one's local school, is much lower: Just 25 percent would give an A or B grade to American schools as a whole.

Similarly, although the Gallup poll found public approval of U.S. education at a low ebb, parents like their own kids' schools. Seventy-six percent say they are satisfied with the education their oldest child has been receiving. That figure has been pretty stable for 16 years. And there's no partisan divide on that question at all.

Nothing new about this, says McDonnell: ""With regard to different ratings for local schools vs. public schools in general ... that finding is a long-standing one.""

She compares it to the gap between how Americans view Congress in general with opinions of one's own representative.

For example, this month Gallup reported that just 18 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing. However, the last time they asked, 54 percent approved of the job their own representative was doing.

In psychology, this is known as the ""mere-exposure"" effect: Essentially, people tend to like things better the more they are familiar with them.

""Even people without school-age children have some limited knowledge of their local schools, from the media, their neighbors, following the sports teams,"" says McDonnell. ""So they are inclined to be less judgmental about them than they are about public schools in general, whose image is somewhat vague and increasingly negative though media images."""

The New York Times is reviewing some of its reporting about the San Bernardino terrorist couple, Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple writes. The Times is looking back at a story that said Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik had “talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad.”

The Times is examining the story and the anonymous sourcing for that claim because the FBI says it has not found any public social media postings by Farook and Malik that might have “tipped off authorities to the couple’s extremist views,” as The Two-Way writes. Instead, it looks like the couple communicated via emails and private messages.

Whether the communications were public or private is important. Wemple calls it “a gigantic deal” because the Times’ story went on to say that American immigration officials failed to uncover “what Ms. Malik had made little effort to hide — that she talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad.” That’s a damning conclusion if the couple had been communicating in the open. If they weren’t doing that, the story went too far.

But this Memmo isn’t just about what the Times did. It’s about what NPR did.

Carrie Johnson, Dina Temple-Raston, Phil Ewing, Martin Kaste, Nathan Rott, Richard Gonzalez, Matt Guilhem, the Two-Way team, the Newscast desk and everyone else who touched the story* stuck to what we were confident we could say and avoided things that weren’t solid. They were precise in their language. For example, we were careful to say federal sources were telling NPR that Malik had posted a message on Facebook “at the time of the shooting.” That information has held up.

Thanks.

An editor once told me that if I asked 12 economists what was likely to happen I would get 13 opinions.

That line came to mind in recent days as I talked to people across NPR News about whether we do or do not allow music to be embedded in longer news stories. I’m talking about incidental music that is there, at the very least, to improve the listening experience, but otherwise has no obvious connection to the story. I’m also talking about longer pieces that are broadcast, not podcasts.

– “No …” I was told. NPR has a rule: No music; no sound effects. We don’t put anything in our broadcast pieces that isn’t “true” to the stories.

– “Sure …” I was assured. We’ve been adding music for years when it’s felt that “scoring” would improve a piece.

– “Well …” others said. Music can be used as a bookend or to create a bridge between sections of a long report. But it should never be layered beneath reporting.

– “But …” began some. If it’s obvious to listeners that the music is being used in a feature in a humorous way or in a long news story to set off a particular section, it’s OK to run it beneath the script.

– “Only …” said some. Music may be OK in features, but only rarely and with a “less is more” approach. That is, be sparing. We’re making news stories, not movies.

There was agreement on one thing. Music can’t be used in news stories to make editorial statements or to steer a listener toward judgments or conclusions. We don’t do those things – just as we would not tell the audience how to feel about the news we’re reporting.

But, but, but … what is an editorial statement and when is something manipulative? We can’t agree. There’s a “know it when we see it” sense.

After all that, here’s where are:

– There is no rule against putting music into broadcast pieces. It’s been done and is being done every week in features or special projects. Listen to WESUN’s “For The Record” series, a recent “Hidden Brain” piece that was recast for radio, Morning Edition’s report on “How The Libyan Revolution Opened The Door To The Islamic State” and the “Changing Lives of Women” essay from the “gray-haired granny” who has gone “punk rock.” Judge for yourself whether the music worked.

– Even those who advocate for the use of music say that “because it sounds cool” is not a reason to use it. Don’t do this either: Add music in the hope it will make a bad story better. There’s a problem with the story. Fix it or kill it.

– There’s agreement that music must be treated like any other piece of our journalism. An informed, editorially based decision is crucial. Be prepared to answer this question: “What’s that doing there?”

– We’re also in agreement that incidental music should not be layered beneath straight-forward, standard news stories.

– “Less is more” is a very important concept. Yes, there’s a case to be made that we need to keep up with the times and that some popular podcasts (including NPR’s) use music very effectively. But, we care deeply about principles such as honesty, transparency and fairness. Adding music can quickly raise questions in listeners’ minds about whether we’re staying true to our principles. A decade ago in Jonathan Kern’s Sound Reporting, Jay Kernis said that music could be added to “certain feature stories and mini-documentaries — on rare occasions.” The occasions are probably less rare these days, but we’re still thinking that they should be carefully considered.

This isn’t a “thou must” or “must not” note, as you can see. We have to take these thoughts and apply them as cases come up. That means talking to each other. Executive producers and desk heads need to be in on decisions about whether music should or shouldn’t be used in broadcast pieces. They should bring in the DMEs (Chuck Holmes and Gerry Holmes) or standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott) if outside opinions are needed. In coming months, watch for training opportunities about the use of music.

It was a tragic turning point.

On July 11, South Sudanese soldiers invaded a hotel in the capital city of Juba and gang-raped foreign aid workers.

""The soldiers just came to the bathroom where all the girls were hiding and they just picked us out of the bathroom one by one,"" says one of the women who was in the hotel. She asked that her name not be used.

Despite calls for help to the U.N. compound a mile down the road, no one came.

Even in a country where violence is commonplace, where a simmering civil war has been reignited, where the humanitarian needs are among the most pressing in the world, this attack sent shock waves through the aid community.

""Certainly something changed and things happened that we were not used to seeing happen,"" says Steve McCann, a security and risk assessment specialist. And now the repercussions are apparent: Some relief agencies have evacuated staff, and others have scaled back their operations.

The incident happened amid a whirlwind of fighting that erupted in Juba last month between government troops loyal to president Salva Kiir and soldiers aligned with former vice president Reik Machar. Machar and his soldiers had recently come back from exile as part of a peace process to end a conflict that began in 2013.

But Machar's return quickly sparked open combat between armies split predominantly along ethnic lines.

When the fighting began on July 8 in the dusty dirt streets of Juba, foreign aid workers hunkered down in their compounds. The violence raged for 4 days and left more than 300 people dead, including refugees inside a United Nation compound and 2 Chinese peacekeepers. Thousands of people fled their homes.

On the southwestern edge of the capital, more than two dozen aid workers took shelter inside the grounds of the Terrain Hotel. The hotel, less than a mile from a large United Nation peacekeeping base, is popular with foreigners. During the fighting most of the foreign aid workers who sought shelter there were from the United States, Australia and the Philippines.

""There were intermittent highs and lows in the fighting,"" says the American woman who spoke to NPR. ""There was a lot of military activity on the road outside of our compound. We were told [by our head office] that they were trying to evacuate us but there were too many checkpoints along the road. That it wasn't safe and that we just need to just sit there and wait.""

On the fourth day of the fighting dozens of South Sudanese troops broke through the gate into the hotel grounds.

A group of about 30 foreign aid workers and a South Sudanese editor who was working for a USAID funded project barricaded themselves in the second story of a block of apartments at the hotel. The block had been built as a ""safe house"" with metal gates on the balconies and steel reinforced doors.

For several hours the soldiers pillaged the hotel, ripping out appliances, ransacking rooms and even carting off the generator. The holed-up humanitarians frantically called the U.N., the U.S. embassy and private security firms to send help.

But help did not arrive. At a U.N. base just up the road, armed peacekeepers with armored vehicles couldn't get authorization to leave their base and go to the hotel. The U.S. Embassy didn't have the resources to dispatch a rescue team. Private security companies also said the streets were too dangerous to reach the Terrain Hotel.

""The soldiers were trying to break down the door and then they started shooting through the door,"" says the American woman. One bullet hit a Vermont-based contractor in the leg.

Finally the door gave way.

Once they got in, the predominantly Dinka government soldiers shot and killed a South Sudanese journalist, John Gatluak. Gatluak, who's from the Nuer ethnic group, was working for Internews, a USAID-funded project to teach media skills to local journalists.

Then the soldiers grabbed the women who were hiding in the bathroom.

""The soldier that picked me, he walked me in to another room,"" says the American. ""The room that he walked me in to there was blood on the floor and there were panties on the floor. So I knew what he was going to do.""

She collapsed on the floor in a fetal position, clutching her knees to her chest and refusing to move.

""He kept hitting me with an AK-47, yelling at me to open my legs,"" the American woman says. She says the soldier kept screaming at her, ""'Open your legs. I'm going to kill you if you don't open your legs.'""

Eventually, she says, another soldier who appeared to be a commander ordered the soldier to stop. She says she was not raped. But at least 5 women were. One told the Associated Press that 15 men assaulted her for hours.

Hours after the attack on the Terrain Hotel began, most of the aid workers were finally taken out of the hotel by security forces aligned with the same government troops that had attacked them. Three of the Western women weren't rescued until the next morning.

Steve McCann, the security specialist, says South Sudan has been a dangerous place for years. His company, Safer Edge, trains international relief groups in conflict zones around the world.

In the past McCann didn't expect that foreign aid workers in South Sudan would be directly and personally attacked.

""No,"" he says. ""We didn't feel that international staff were the targets. No.""

There are places in the world where international aid workers simply can't operate — parts of Syria, Libya, Yemen and Somalia for instance. Before the Terrain Hotel attack, South Sudan wasn't one of those no-go zones. And McCann cautions that this incident won't cause all aid agencies to pull their foreigners out of the country. But the growing insecurity will force groups to reassess their operations and be far more cautious in South Sudan.

Julien Schopp with Interaction, an umbrella group for development and relief agencies based in Washington, says this incident was the culmination of 2 years of growing insecurity for aid workers in South Sudan.

""If you look at the latest aid worker security report, for the first time South Sudan is the most insecure location in the world overtaking Afghanistan and Somalia, where we expect more violence,"" Schopp says.

The insecurity for aid agencies in South Sudan comes at the same time the need for international relief is growing rapidly. There's a cholera outbreak, malaria is on the rise, two and a half million people have been driven from their homes and millions more are dependent on international food rations. During the eruption of violence in July, even those food rations weren't safe. An entire warehouse for the U.N. World Food Program in Juba was ransacked."

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes — writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians — like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet — so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason — don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet — and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time — but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator — and occasional NPR contributor — K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second — the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine — and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine."

The presidential campaign, particularly the debates, and breaking news events such as this week’s mass shooting in Oregon draw many of us to social media. We want to monitor the news, post our reporting, share the interesting information we find and offer our thoughts.

That’s great. Have fun out there.

But … (there’s always a “but”) … all of us — journalists as well as those in other departments — need to remember that what we post and retweet can reflect on NPR. None of us want NPR’s reputation for fairness to be put in doubt because of things we do on digital platforms.

We’ve issued guidance on this before. Everyone is expected to be familiar with our thinking. Please reread:

– The “Social Media” section of the handbook. The introduction specifically mentions NPR’s journalists, but the principles apply to others here as well. If you’re in doubt, talk to your supervisor:

“The Internet and the social media communities it encompasses can be incredible resources. They offer both a remarkably robust amount of historical material and an incredible amount of ‘real-time’ reporting from people at the scenes of breaking news events. But they also present new and unfamiliar challenges, and they tend to amplify the effects of any ethical misjudgments you might make. So tread carefully. Conduct yourself online just as you would in any other public circumstances as an NPR journalist. Treat those you encounter online with fairness, honesty and respect, just as you would offline. Verify information before passing it along. Be honest about your intent when reporting. Avoid actions that might discredit your professional impartiality. And always remember, you represent NPR.”

– “Some Guidance About Social Media On Election Day.” You could substitute the words “Debate Night” for “Election Day.”

– “Reminder: There Is No Privacy On The Web, And ‘Personal’ Pages Are Not Safe Zones.” Here’s a key paragraph:

“Matt Thompson offers a test. Before posting something about your work or a news event or an issue, even if you’re putting it on what you think of as a personal page, ask this question: ‘Is it helping my journalism, or is it hurting my journalism?’ ”

Jean-Baptiste ""Toots"" Thielemans, the Belgian-American musician who cut a singular path as a jazz harmonica player, died in his sleep Monday in his hometown of Brussels. He was 94.

He began his professional career as a guitar player (and added the ability to whistle a line above it), but inspired by the mid-20th-century innovations of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, he returned to the chromatic harmonica and developed a bebop-influenced technique on it. He performed and recorded widely with his bebop heroes and many other stars of postwar jazz, and his tune ""Bluesette"" quickly became a jazz standard. His work also graces many film and television scores.

Thielemans' first instrument was actually the accordion; he was a child entertainer in the Brussels sidewalk cafe run by his parents. As a teenager, he took up harmonica and guitar, but he still didn't dream of music as a career.

""Being a musician was not really a profession, so you needed to try to get a diploma,"" he told Marian McPartland for a 2005 episode of Piano Jazz. He pursued a degree in mathematics instead. ""But Louis Armstrong changed all that.""

He had heard jazz, and it became his passion, playing along to radio broadcasts of swing bands and, later, bebop. However, the harmonica was and is still best-known as a blues or folk instrument — or a toy — and he faced an uphill battle for acceptance.

""And the musicians say, 'Hey, you could be a good musician, you know,' "" Thielemans said on a 1997 episode of NPR's Jazz Profiles. "" 'But throw this away, get a real instrument.' So that's how I became a guitar player.""

In 1948, he visited the U.S. for the first time and sat in on a few jam sessions. He caught the ear of an agent for star clarinetist Benny Goodman, who invited Thielemans to join Goodman on a European tour.

From there, Thielemans was off and running. He moved to the U.S. and joined pianist George Shearing's popular quintet for five years, and he freelanced with many jazz greats. He described his style for Jazz Profiles:

""It's like a painting with a lot of pastel colors,"" he said. ""It's not red, it's not black — it's some of those tones in between. ... So between plus, between minus, between happy and not-so-happy."" He demonstrated on the song ""You Don't Know What Love Is."" ""A tear comes quickly to me, or a smile, you know. That's where my music is, I guess.""

As the 1960s dawned, he added another trick to his bag. Inspired by singing bassist Slam Stewart, he started whistling in unison with his guitar. It's showcased on the original recording of his tune ""Bluesette,"" which soon became an international hit.

The device caught the ears of fans — and more. Thielemans became a first-call studio musician for top arrangers like Quincy Jones. His harmonica graced the theme song for Sesame Street and the score for the movie Midnight Cowboy. And that's his whistling in the commercial jingle for Old Spice toiletries.

Jazz remained his first love; even toward the end of his career, he would begin every morning with practice on the complex changes to John Coltrane's ""Giant Steps."" Harmonica player Howard Levy says Thielemans kept pushing himself to expand his musical vocabulary in an emotionally compelling way.

""Toots was a transcendent musician,"" Levy says. ""If he had picked up any other instrument he would have been just as great. ... He was really playing music through the harmonica rather than playing the harmonica.""

He suffered a stroke in his 60s, which limited his facility for playing the guitar, but he continued touring. He was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in the U.S., and a baron by the king of Belgium. And he only retired from performing at the age of 92."

Digital Services

In addition to a significant and growing radio service, NPR is widely recognized as a leader among media organizations in the digital arena. NPR is enthusiastically embracing digital media platforms and culture. Over the last two years our entire newsroom participated in extensive training to support a successful transition to the multimedia environment.

NPR.org presents constantly updated news and alerts, timely news blogs, streaming audio, downloadable multimedia content, exclusive multimedia features (video and photojournalism) and free access to more than 10 years of archived coverage and transcripts to web users through NPR.org. NPR Podcasts are among the most-downloaded sources of podcasts in the world, delivering approximately 32 million podcast downloads every month.

NPR realized the power of mobile early, launching a NPR News iPhone App in August 2009, which quickly joined the ranks of the top free News apps in the iPhones App store, and then a NPR Music App in June 2010; an Android NPR News App in December 2009; and an app and optimized site for the iPad when the product was first introduced. NPR.org was revamped in the summer of 2009 to more seamlessly bridge the NPR on-air and online experience. Digital metrics suggest that our audience is engaged with us; we have approximately 2.5 million Twitter followers and more than 2.4 million Facebook fans.

In 2007, NPR Music launched as a free online music discovery destination devoted to music genres neglected by commercial media. Enriched by content from member station partners, it features live concerts and in-studio performances, interviews, reporting on-location from major music festivals and events, as well as reviews, blogs, and recommendations. The site is an influential arbiter of music tastes and trends, identifying and promoting classical, jazz and blues, rock/folk/pop, world, and urban artists. Its concerts at South by Southwest are must-hears.

More innovation is right around the corner. NPR will continue to invest in online media to ensure that our programming and stations are always relevant and compelling to audiences.

Technology Leadership

Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS)

NPR is the home of The Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), a combined satellite and internet content distribution service that distributes public radio programming and related digital content. This includes our content and the work of other program producers, including American Public Media (APM), Public Radio International (PRI), and independent public radio producers. The PRSS is managed by our Distribution Division, and its annual operations are entirely self-supporting based on the fees paid by both public and commercial clients.

Application Program Interface

In July 2008 NPR was the first major media organization to establish an open API (Application Programming Interface) to bring our content to a wider audience in a manner that is open, accessible and free. The NPR API provides a way for two computer applications to communicate in a common language so that NPR member stations, the public, and other non-profit organizations can find our content and present it on their own websites or applications.

NPR Labs

Offering innovative research and consulting services to the broadcast industry, NPR Labs is a leader in the advancement of broadcast radio technology. We are the only major broadcast organization that invests in radio technology assessment and research and development on an ongoing basis.

The Labs' engineering group is recognized internationally as a radio technology authority. In 2003 the team developed digital multicasting for HD Radio, the replacement technology for analog radio, and they conducted research and tests that led to improvements in the performance of HD technology.

Multicasting makes it possible for all radio stations — commercial and non-commercial — to offer multiple streams of programming on one channel, free to the public. More Labs-initiated innovations in digital radio are underway, including development of accessible media services for those with hearing and vision impairments.

Satellite and International Radio

Beyond the radio station network, and web and mobile services and applications, NPR programs a channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and one web-based stream. NPR also produces multiple international services heard in more than 150 countries, provides programming for Armed Services Radio and operates a radio station in Berlin.

A Brief History Of NPR And Public Radio

1920s-'40s

Our roots go back to the earliest days of American broadcasting. In the 1920s, many of the country's first radio stations grew up at colleges and universities who wanted to experiment with this new medium to educate and entertain the public. In the late 1940s, the Federal Communications Commission allotted the lower end of the new FM band exclusively to noncommercial, educational stations, setting the stage for a major station expansion. This is where most public stations are still found today.

1950s-'60s

As commercial radio began its first decline with the advent of TV, public radio grew, along with public TV. The big breakthrough came in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act. This new law led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which Congress called upon to encourage ""the growth and development of non-commercial radio"" and to develop ""programming that will be responsive to the interests of the people.""

CPB introduced technical and professional standards to improve what were then mainly small stations. Soon, CPB and individual stations saw the need for a national radio service to bring Johnson's vision to life.

1970s

NPR was incorporated on Feb. 26, 1970, by 90 forward-thinking charter stations to provide national news programming. In April 1971, NPR hit the air with live coverage of the Senate hearings on the war in Vietnam. Just a month later, NPR debuted its first weekday newsmagazine, All Things Considered. In 1977, NPR assumed a new responsibility — to represent the interests of NPR member stations (who had grown from 90 to 190) — before Congress, the FCC and others. NPR's morning newsmagazine, Morning Edition, launched in 1979, signaling that the network was becoming an all-day news service.

1980s

This was a decade of transformational and tumultuous change. NPR launched the first ever nationwide, satellite-delivered radio distribution network to serve a growing network of about 250 stations, ushering in a decade that saw an explosion in new national programs for public radio. In 1983, NPR suffered a severe financial crisis; it emerged with stronger governance and management, and an improved business model that ultimately propelled growth for both NPR and stations.

Enlarge this image toggle caption NPR NPR

1990s

A growing interest in news — local, national and international, led to expanded distribution of NPR programming and growth in audience. The Gulf War inspired the 1991 launch of NPR's first talk program, Talk of the Nation, and ultimately, the emergence of the public radio news-talk format. NPR launched NPR Worldwide in 1993, providing programming beyond the boundaries of the U.S., and throughout the decade NPR stations expanded their services — acquiring additional stations and growing their own programming and operations. The effort in 1994 to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting led to an unprecedented burst in contributions from listeners, and a groundswell of non-partisan political support from the public. Federal support for public broadcasting was maintained.

2000s

Sept. 11, 2001, was a turning point for NPR, a catalyst to shift our orientation even more fully to high-quality, contextual, timely news — both domestic and foreign. Over the past few years, NPR has extended its focus to build an equally compelling service on NPR.org, as well as mobile sites and apps. These digital platforms offer more ways to listen, learn and experience NPR and its member stations, and new people are discovering the network every day.

Today NPR is experiencing another era of innovation, not unlike the earliest days of radio — though much faster, and more chaotic and dynamic. The network's radio service offers a strong foundation, as NPR and its stations are actively embracing the power and potential of digital media to serve our mission."

It’s clearly stated in the Ethics Handbook that “we don’t allow sources to dictate how a topic will be covered.”

That’s a pretty basic rule.

We’re bringing it up now because of reports about 2009 email exchanges between then-Atlantic contributing editor Marc Ambinder and Philippe Reines, spokesman for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton:

- “This Is How Hillary Clinton Gets the Coverage She Wants” (Gawker)

- “Corrupt journalism doesn’t pay. Nor does abetting it.”(The Washington Post)

According to those reports, Ambinder got a scoop about a Clinton speech by agreeing to Reines’ “conditions.” One: that the address be described as “muscular.” Two: That he report that Clinton’s high-profile deputies would be there to show their support for the secretary.

Ambinder tells Gawker that the transaction “made me uncomfortable then, and it makes me uncomfortable today.”

“Unacceptable” is the word that comes to our mind.

On Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and other social media platforms, we’ve been doing lots of great work. Thank you for engaging with the audience in those places. It’s very important.

Now, a “memmo” wouldn’t be a “memmo” without some nudging. Here goes:

The political conventions are approaching. During them, you may be tempted to say some things on social media – especially when candidates are on stage and the urge to live tweet is strong. This is a good time to remind everyone about our thinking when it comes to social media.

- Keep your politics to yourself. And that means on Facebook too. You may think only your “friends” are seeing what you say, but they may share it widely.

- Control your cursing. NPR journalists don’t swear on the air and we don’t think they should be swearing in the digital world either. But we also know that language that isn’t appropriate in one place is common in another. How about this: Don’t use such words in anger and never in a way that might look like a political comment.

- No personal attacks, even if you’re trolled.

- Speaking of trolls, don’t feed them. Here’s a tip: You do not have to respond to any obnoxious Tweet, Facebook post or other diatribe. They can be ignored. (If they feel threatening, please send a message about them to our internal distribution list, “NPRThreats.”)

- If you do respond, stay classy. Something along the lines of “I’m sorry you feel that way and would like to hear more about why you do” is far better than “go back to the cave you crawled out of.” Remember, “we are civil in our actions and words, avoiding arrogance and hubris. We listen to others.”

- By the way, you can usually tell after one or two exchanges whether the person on the other end is willing to have a conversation or just wants to rant. If it’s a conversation, great. If they’re just ranting, disengage with something like, “thanks, I’m out. We just disagree.”

There’s more guidance in the Ethics Handbook, under “Social media.”

There have also been several “memmos” on the subject:

- Before Super Tuesday, A Reminder About Social Media

- Reporter’s Suspension For A Tweet Makes This A Good Time To Read Our Social Media Guidance

- Read This If You Use Social Media; Everyone Should Know Our Thinking

Here's a tip for jazz musicians that works better than it should: If you wish to be noticed by people who use words, play some covers. Not standards, but songs from a more recent era of popular music, or something else left-field. Even today, it stands out from mainstream practice, which shifts gradually over longer durations. It moves the playing field away from the nuts and bolts of your playing, where our critical lexicon is generally impoverished, to your signaled influences and decision-making, which are much easier to talk about. At the very least, it tends to be amusing.

It was especially true in 2003, when a high-energy, quirky, leaderless trio of white guys from the Minnesota-Wisconsin hinterlands issued its first major-label album, These Are The Vistas. That album by The Bad Plus powered the previously jazz-insider band to modest mainstream success in a hurry, and because any 21st-century artist that dares to achieve mainstream success is thrown into jazz's merciless and incompletely informed court of popular opinion, it was talked about a lot. The chief talking point was that out of 10 tracks, three were pop covers — a statistic that launched more than a few thinkpieces. Why these songs? What does it say about our genre construct? What does it all mean?

These days, such border-crossing behavior is more common. (The four-chord Nirvana hit ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" among the Vistas covers seemingly least suited to coverage, has recently been embraced by a number of higher-profile jazz artists.) Meanwhile, The Bad Plus spent much of the following decade-plus underlining its bona fides in jazz-community participation (in part as trenchant essayists and comedians) and original composition (when not adapting the occasional 20th-century classical landmark). It's still Reid Anderson on bass, Dave King on drums and Ethan Iverson on piano; it still likes to put a hitch in a commanding drumbeat or overgrown dissonance into a cleanly struck piano line; it still brings it live. After more than a dozen years spent touring the world, The Bad Plus' covers gambit seems much less like thirst for provocation than hunger for adventure.

So, yes: The Bad Plus' new album, It's Hard, is all covers. There's no particular overarching aesthetic to the selection. It encompasses alternative rock from the '00s (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV On The Radio); hits of the '80s (Prince, Cyndi Lauper, Peter Gabriel, Crowded House); a piece from free-jazz hero Ornette Coleman and one from a spiritual descendant of saxophone-blowing and melody-shaping, Bill McHenry; and some other unlikely idiosyncrasies (Barry Manilow). Neither is there a formula for approaching these songs. Some seem like acts of reinvention, disassembly and re-engineering (Kraftwerk sans motorik beat); others amplify the existing energy the best a mischievous acoustic piano trio can (Johnny Cash as a shuffle after too many drinks).

These covers, like those of 2003 or any since, are not ""ironic"" or ""novelty."" Somewhat naive, maybe; impishly tweaked, likely. But they're not high art looking down upon low art, or lifting it into its realm. If anything, Anderson, King and Iverson are pop agnostics who offer some fundamental respect toward each song, its creator and its potential. Their project always seemed to be foremost about applying an original dialect to any song, whether generated internally or absorbed, processed and rearranged. In that light, It's Hard feels like an intensive self-examination: a long-running band testing its powers of interpretation with whatever comes to mind. And it tends to be amusing."

Nice work by all those involved in today’s news from the Navy Yard. We did not fall into the traps that some other media outlets did. We stuck with what was known, we were clear about what was not known, and we stayed away from rumors.

A couple things to keep in mind:

– When passing along information to the lead editor(s) and Newsdesk-Eds@npr.org, please be as specific as you can about the source. For example, if the news is that the “all clear” has been given, tell us who’s saying that. A police lieutenant you just spoke to? The public information officer on the scene? The mayor’s chief of staff? Knowing that will help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

– When passing along information, be clear about what you feel “can be reported” and what “cannot be reported” (but is something you want editors to be aware of). That will also help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

Again, those are points to keep in mind. But the most important thing to take away from today is how well we did when it came to reporting solid information and staying away from thinly sourced rumors. Thanks.

Recalcitrant singer-songwriter Cass McCombs has never cared for The Man. The quiet iconoclast is about to release his eighth studio album, Mangy Love, and not once has he caved to the whims of labels, critics or fans. That's not to say his music is confrontational; in fact, his '70s AM vibe might go down too smoothly for some. But McCombs' dedication to craft and distaste for compromise is unwavering. It's the kind of steely self-confidence that provides fleeting inspiration to the rebel hiding inside all of us, before we go back to whatever pays our bills.

On Mangy Love, McCombs aims his fascist-killing machine at some controversial topics. Right out of the gate, ""Bum Bum Bum"" calls out the U.S. military-industrial complex: ""You think you've heard it all before / Well, here's once more / We're all at war."" In ""Run Sister Run,"" he gets explicit about women's reproductive rights: ""They're coming at you from all sides / To imprint your body and say they didn't.""

McCombs isn't staging this 12-song filibuster by himself. The session musicians conjuring those '70s vibes might constitute his best backing band yet. Bassist and studio wizard Dan Horne teams with Gang Gang Dance drummer Jesse Lee for some Grateful Dead grooves that would make Phil Lesh and Bill Kreutzmann proud, if not a little jealous. Aiding Horne behind the boards is Rob Schnapf, who helped produce some of Elliott Smith's most memorable work. And it needn't go unmentioned that indie-rock do-no-wrong Angel Olsen makes a special appearance in the album's lead single, ""Opposite House."""

Asali Solomon's novel is about a girl growing up in West Philadelphia whose parents were black nationalists. ""My parents taught us to revere Africa,"" she says. Originally broadcast Feb. 5, 2015.

DAVE DAVIES, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Today we're going to listen to Terry's interview with Asali Solomon, whose novel's about a girl growing up in the '80s the daughter of black nationalist, Afrocentric parents. The book, ""Disgruntled,"" is now out in paperback. Its main character, Kenya, feels like an outsider in her neighborhood school in West Philadelphia because she's such a dedicated student. But when she's sent to a private school, she's an outsider because she's one of the few African-American students. She feels guilty she's not measuring up to the model she thinks she's supposed to be portraying, the brilliant black girl, heir to those brave children in the South who'd shine their shoes each morning, only to get kicked and spat on in their fight for a good education. Many of the suburban white students assume everyone in Kenya's neighborhood is on welfare.

The novel's rich with observations about race, class, the impact of divorce on a child and growing up with a father sometimes uses his politics to justify irresponsible behavior. ""Disgruntled"" is Asali Solomon's first novel. Her previous book, ""Get Down,"" is a collection of short stories. In 2007, she was named one of the National Book Foundation's 5 under 35. She teaches English literature and creative writing at Haverford College. Terry spoke to her last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Asali Solomon, welcome to FRESH AIR. I'm going to ask you to read from the very beginning of your novel.

ASALI SOLOMON: OK, thank you. So here we go.

(Reading) In the first grade at Henry Charles Lea School in West Philadelphia, when Kenya told kids that she celebrated Kwanzaa, no one knew what she was talking about. By the third grade, led by the tiny tyrant L'Tisha Simmons, the kids were calling her an African booty scratcher and chanting to a conga line rhythm, you don't get no presents. You don't get no presents. In fact, she did get presents on the last morning of Kwanzaa, seven days after Christmas. By the fourth grade, Kenya was down to one friend. It wasn't just the Kwanzaa problem. And anyway, she could have lied about Kwanzaa like she suspected Fatima McCullers did - Fatima, whose dad had dreadlocks and who always said Christmas and Santa Claus with a wavering inflection.

It was also that she couldn't eat any pork, including the bologna sandwiches that were the everyday fare of the lunch room - something to do with her father muttering that white people forced slaves to eat hog guts. Though, as far as Kenya could see, white people loved bologna enough to give it both a first and a second name. It was that she wasn't allowed to watch ""Gimme A Break!,"" ""Good Times,"" or ""Diff'rent Strokes"" because according to her mother, watching black people on TV acting the fool was worse than not watching any at all. It was that she was forbidden to actually speak the Pledge of Allegiance and had been directed to mouth it with her hand not actually touching her chest. It was that she had to call her father Baba. And when she'd asked if she could call him daddy like other people, it had triggered what seemed like days of lectures, during which Kenya learned to hate the phrase other people. It was that while her parents said grace like normal people, they directed it to the creator instead of God.

GROSS: And that's Asali Solomon reading from her new novel, ""Disgruntled."" Does any of this describe how you were raised?

SOLOMON: So yeah, some of the things - we celebrated Kwanzaa. I don't know that my parents, like, specifically forbade us to say the Pledge of Allegiance. But there was something about that. Like, we should not be saying the Pledge of Allegiance. Like, it was a farce. We didn't eat pork, although the reason for that was never quite explained to me. Like, even much later I was like, why didn't we eat pork? Well, it's not good for you. But I think maybe my parents didn't like it. But it was part of a thing at the time that I think people were taking from black Muslims. And it was also true that when I went to public school in West Philadelphia, I was not in the majority. Like - but the lifestyle I was leading was different from what other people were leading, you know? Like, my parents taught us to revere Africa. People at school made fun of Africa. So a lot of things like that were true.

GROSS: Did your parents consider themselves black nationalists or Afrocentric?

SOLOMON: Yeah, they - I think they considered themselves black nationalists. But the phrase black nationalist, I think, implies a level of action that doesn't necessarily describe them. So it was that they thought about themselves as being a part of an entity that was black people in America - right? - as opposed to just thinking of oneself as an American and thinking of oneself as necessarily kind of in opposition to kind of mainstream America. And as for being Afrocentric, I mean, they named my sister and I - they gave us African names. We celebrated Kwanzaa, which is not an African holiday. It's an African-American holiday. But it is based on a reverence for and a connection to Africa. So in that way - yeah.

GROSS: You know, one of the things I just really enjoyed about reading your novel is I'm always so interested in what it's like for the children of parents who have carved out a way of being different, who are consciously, like, rejecting mainstream culture and have this kind of alternate philosophy, whether it's Afrocentrism or being, you know - not that these two are the equivalent of - or being a hippie or, like, rejecting religion...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...Or being politically radical or whatever - you know, to have, like, their own culture or counterculture. And for the children, who didn't choose that and who might feel different from the other children in their school or their neighborhood, to grow up in that - and what it makes them feel - peculiar or different, as a result of - and your book is just filled with insights about that, I think.

SOLOMON: Right. And I think that depending on the things your parents ask you to do - the kind of sacrifices they ask you to make - it can be empowering to know that, you know, the reason you feel like you're not at ease can be explained by these things - versus - I think almost everybody feels like, at a certain point, particularly during the process of coming age, that they are not at ease. They don't fit in but have no (laughter) reason for that. Oh, there must be something wrong with me - you know, kind of a thing. So there can be something strengthening about it. But also, you know, when all you really want to do is fit in, then it can be very difficult.

GROSS: And I was thinking about that reading your book. Like, in the reading that you did, you mention the shows that the mother in the book didn't want the kid to watch...

SOLOMON: Oh, yeah, that was - I forgot. So that was a thing in our house, as well.

GROSS: ...Because black people are acting like fools on it...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...Better not to see anything. And then one of Kenya's parent's friends says to Kenya, why are you watching ""The Muppets?"" There's no black Muppets...

SOLOMON: Yeah, right (laughter).

GROSS: Like, you shouldn't be watching this.

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: And it just made me think about how consciousness-raising, when you're doing it with children...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...Also comes with all these prescriptions of things that you can't do that are going to...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...Like, remove you from other people of your age and from the popular culture of the time, even if the racially conscious perceptions about that culture might be accurate. But it's still - you're just a kid...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...When parents are telling you that.

SOLOMON: No. And I mean, you know, I went to kindergarten and definitely told some people Santa Claus didn't exist. And (laughter) you know, I - yeah, those television shows - I mean, it wasn't so much that I was forbidden to watch those television shows. But, you know, it was kind of frowned upon to be watching a lot of those television shows. And I - you know, I had a breakdown for each of them, why they were nefarious, you know? And it is very hard to be a child living a righteous (laughter) lifestyle, you know, and explain that to your friends and still be a part of things.

GROSS: The parents in the novel are always referring to the word the community and all the things they need to do for the community. Did your parents use that expression? And what did it mean in your family?

SOLOMON: They did. They - you know, they would talk about the community. And that meant black people. And more closely, it meant working-class black people in Philadelphia or, you know, just black people in Philadelphia. I mean, I guess the thing that was funny about it is that was one of those things that I didn't think was particularly exotic until much later, when I realized that other people did not go around talking about the community and what we needed to do for the community. But again, what it meant was that we were part of this entity. And we should always sort of be bearing in mind how we were representing that entity or what we were doing for that entity.

GROSS: In the novel, the main character's parents and a group of the parents' friends form a group called the Seven Days. And it's inspired by a Toni Morrison novel called ""Song Of Solomon."" I want you to explain the connection between the Toni Morrison novel and the Seven Days group.

SOLOMON: So in ""Song of Solomon,"" Milkman is the main character of the novel. And it's basically a quest novel, where Milkman is kind of trying to find himself. He has a best friend named Guitar, who joins a radical group called the Seven Days. And the Seven Days - essentially, when they hear of a black person who's been murdered, they go out and murder an equivalent white person in an equivalent way.

And, I mean, I think what Morrison was trying to do in that novel is explore the lure of violence. Like, it seems like a good way to assert black humanity, in a way, and a good way to get back at oppression. But by the end, I think, you know, the novel seems to come to the conclusion that that is crazy. And it will drive you crazy. And by the end of the novel, Guitar is quite insane and possibly trying to murder Milkman. The Seven Days in the book is a group where Johnbrown and Sheila, who don't agree on a lot in terms of...

GROSS: Those are the parents...

SOLOMON: Yeah - who often don't agree on things like what they're reading, have both read and love this novel. And they have this idea for a group called the Seven Days. And originally, Johnbrown really wants it to be a combination of sort of service to the community and acts of anarchy and not violent but kind of aggressive acts. But it becomes that the parents and their friends do these acts of community service, you know, one day a week, kind of like the Seven Days. So that's the connection there.

GROSS: Was service an issue in your family? Was that emphasized in your family?

SOLOMON: Yes, it was. I mean, my parents worked hard. So they didn't have tons of leisure time. But it was more of a thing - like, going to marches, going to rallies. There were different kinds of things that they did. My mother started a group called Sisters Remember Malcolm. And she and some friends of hers had this organization that every year would throw a commemorative program honoring Malcolm X. And this was in the days when Malcolm X was a lot less well-known than he is today. We also - I mean, one of the things in the novel that's based in truth is that we did go around giving Kwanzaa programs. I would call it the Kwanzaa von Trapp family.

(LAUGHTER)

SOLOMON: Because we would go - you know, we'd been to the library. We'd go to schools. And, I mean, it was torture. I mean, ironically, now I do this at my son's day care but - go around doing that. So there were things that we did, yeah, for the community.

GROSS: Do you still celebrate Kwanzaa with your children?

SOLOMON: I do. I mean, in my house - I married a Jewish man. And we celebrate everything except Christmas.

(LAUGHTER)

SOLOMON: So we celebrate - but it's like - I mean, this year, it was like 15 days of madness, you know?

GROSS: (Laughter).

SOLOMON: It was just like it doesn't stop. But yeah, we celebrate Kwanukkah (ph).

GROSS: (Laughter).

SOLOMON: But, yeah.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Asali Solomon. And her novel is called ""Disgruntled."" Let's take a short break here. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Asali Solomon. We're talking about her novel ""Disgruntled.""

The father in your novel sees himself as a radical force for social change. And he sees himself as a philosopher. And he's writing his great text, which is called ""The Key."" And he describes it as a contemporary work of black philosophy that would also be a way of living for non-black peoples who were enlightened. It would draw on classical thought, as well as West African and Native American ways of knowing. It would unite Du Bois, Ellison, Cleaver, Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X - very, very ambitious work. But the father is really a mix of radical politics, philosophy and a lot of B.S.

SOLOMON: (Laughter). Yeah.

GROSS: (Laughter) Because, you know, he's never going to finish this work.

SOLOMON: No.

GROSS: And the work is really - what's the right word to use to describe it?

SOLOMON: Bombastic?

GROSS: That's good.

SOLOMON: I mean, just...

GROSS: Confusing.

SOLOMON: Confusing.

GROSS: A mess.

SOLOMON: Yeah, a way of not living his life.

GROSS: And of not being responsible to the people in his life.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: Because there's always this, like, great text that's more important than we are...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...That he's working on.

SOLOMON: I mean, the father is - it's funny because more than necessarily being a type of a black father, he's definitely a type of a man (laughter), you know, in a lot of ways. And actually, I didn't realize this - I was writing it. And then in the middle of writing it, I reread the novel ""Middlemarch."" And there's a key in ""Middlemarch,"" right? So, Dorothea, who's one of the protagonists in ""Middlemarch,"" marries this older man who she reveres for his mind. But he's always, you know, in his library writing ""The Key To All Mythology"" - I think it's called.

And I think that sort of impressed me, like, this thought that, you know, their lives should be sacrificed for this thing that was never going to see the light of day that no one really cared about, but, you know, was meant to be so meaningful. And Dorothea had to, like, bring him tea. But she wasn't allowed to talk to him at certain times of day. So I think I was sort of thinking about that when I thought of ""The Key."" But yeah, it becomes a way of him just sort of being involved with his own mind and revering his own mind versus living with other people and taking their concerns into account.

GROSS: Were you exposed to people like that, who thought of themselves as being great minds and great philosophers? And you would assume that they were a genius because you never got to see the work? Do you know, like...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...It's easy to be brilliant when nobody sees the brilliant thing that you're working on.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: I've known that person.

SOLOMON: Yeah. You know, it's funny. I can't think of anybody I've known like that personally. The one thing that - and this is not - my father is not Johnbrown by any stretch of the imagination. But he was a songwriter. And it was not his vocation, it was his passion. And he spent a lot of time in the living room playing the piano. And then at one point, he had a studio in the basement. And so he spent a lot of time doing that. But I don't think of it in this way - like, he was working on some nonsense that, you know, he thought was going to change the world or anything like that. But I think the image of a male figure in the house, like, working away on something separate from other parts of the house may have come into that.

GROSS: Books play a really interesting part in your novel because there's a group that's inspired - a group the parents form that's inspired by a Toni Morrison novel. The father is hard at work on this philosophical tome that he'll never finish. No one will ever read it.

(LAUGHTER)

GROSS: It's not going to amount to anything. And the mother is introduced to Audre Lorde. And Audre Lorde, who's a lesbian, feminist author - let me just quote what the mother says to the daughter in this. She says, (reading) I'm not going for that gay stuff. But everything else that this sister said is all right by me. And the father says, (reading) oh, she's probably just an FBI informant.

SOLOMON: (Laughter) Right.

GROSS: And the mother says, (reading) well, she's certainly informed me about why I'm not ironing your shirts or pouring your cereal anymore.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: That strikes me as such a kind of - I've heard that argument, you know? Like, you read a book. You change your mind. And you argue about who you're going to be after that and what you're going to do or not do. And I'm wondering if you were exposed to that as a child - to that kind of argument based on ideas - on new ideas - that the adults were getting exposed to that were changing their sense of who they were and what they wanted out of life. And you were maybe seeing this but too young to really grasp what was going on.

SOLOMON: Yeah, I mean, so I don't remember anything like that. There's a funny thing in there which is that my mother, as far as I can remember, has been a feminist. And that was another thing that I didn't realize was slightly unusual in a household like mine. I mean - but also, I think a lot of working-class black women and educated black women - my mother is educated - both my parents are - and went to college - are feminists but wouldn't articulate it as such. Whereas my mother would pretty much articulate it as such. She would always say things like - people talk about when we got married. She'd say, if you get married, you know, and talk about a lot of things as a choice. Or she would always tell this story of a friend of hers who was raising a child on her own. And somebody would say, oh, you know, you need a husband. And then the friend would say, no, I need a wife. So she was very conscious of the hierarchy of gender and these kinds of things.

GROSS: You mentioned that if you said, when I get married, your mother would say, if you get married...

SOLOMON: That's right.

GROSS: ...And make it clear you had a choice. You didn't have to get married.

SOLOMON: Right, right.

GROSS: I hope I'm not giving away too much here - the child in your book, Kenya, finds out her parents actually never got married - that the father felt like, I don't need the government in our relationship. I don't need a certificate to tell me how I feel or what I should do. And I'm interested in why you created the couple not being married and if that was an issue around you when you were growing up.

SOLOMON: So a funny thing is that one time my mom - I don't know what we were doing. I don't know. She sat me down. We were sitting there. And she said, you know, your father and I aren't married. And I was like, really? And she's like, yeah. And I'm struggling because I'm thinking, like, well, my mom is the one who told me not to say illegitimate. It doesn't matter. But at the same time, it kind of does matter. She was lying. This was some kind of weird prank. (Laughter) Like, you know, just to see what you would say, you know - (laughter) and so I think what I'm doing in the book is thinking about - in that moment, I felt like something dropped away, even though I wasn't - I had been taught not to feel that way. I had been taught not to be invested in this foolishness. But...

GROSS: But it could've been true in the sense that it would've fit into...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...A larger philosophy. I've certainly known plenty of people...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...Who decided not to get married, in spite of the fact that they were having children, or got married only because they were having children or after they had children.

SOLOMON: No, in...

GROSS: But you never know how the children are going to feel about that.

SOLOMON: Well, so I mean - and then the other - so it did take me a while to figure out, for example, that, like, the anniversary of my parents' marriage and my birth date didn't really line - like, my mom's pregnant when they got married. Like, you can see it in the pictures. Like, but, you know, for years, I'd been looking at those pictures without the recognition of that. But neither of my parents would've - they probably would not have had children without getting married. I mean, they came from households that were - my mother's parents were not at all traditional people.

But I think my grandmother could be kind of a hardliner about certain things like that. I mean, again, my grandmother was, like, the original black working-class feminist. You know, she didn't need to learn about these things in classes - about equality, about being forthright, about telling men and people exactly what she thought. But I think she believed that you should get married. And my father's parents actually never married. But I think he would've felt like he was doing a disservice to his mother by not marrying a woman who was pregnant with his child. And they claimed they wanted to get married anyway. That's what they always say.

DAVIES: Asali Solomon's book ""Disgruntled"" is now out in paperback. After a break, we'll hear more of her story. Also, Kevin Whitehead will review some previously unreleased Charlie Parker. And John Powers tells us about the new comedy ""War Dogs"" starring Jonah Hill. I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're listening to Terry's interview with Asali Solomon, the author of ""Disgruntled,"" a novel about race, class, identity and the impact of divorce on a child. It's told from the point of view of a girl named Kenya, growing up in the '80s in West Philadelphia the daughter of black nationalist, Afrocentric parents. ""Disgruntled"" is now out in paperback.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: So one of the family issues in the book that really breaks up the family is that the father in the novel ends up having an affair with one of the mother's good friends...

SOLOMON: One of the Seven Days.

GROSS: ...Who's also a member of the group the Seven Days. And this woman gets pregnant with Kenya's father. And so Kenya's father makes this offer to Kenya and her mother that they could just expand the family and welcome in, you know, this other person and this other person's baby. Would you read that passage from your novel?

SOLOMON: Sure. So this is Johnbrown, the father, talking to Sheila and Kenya after Sheila discovers he's been having an affair.

GROSS: And Sheila is...

SOLOMON: The mother - Kenya's mother.

GROSS: Kenya's mother, yep.

SOLOMON: (Reading) With your permission, Sheila and Kenya, I'd like for Cindalou and the baby to move in here. I'd like for us all to be a family. What did you say? Sheila asked. She dabbed at her mouth with a napkin and looked genuinely as if she hadn't heard, as if she was asking for a small clarification. Did you say cream or sugar? Lemonade - you want me to pass the lemonade? Well, Cindalou and I have been going to some events at the Yoruba temple, and - oh, you actually go out of the house? Glad to hear that. And I don't think the temple is for me. I mean, organized religion is organized religion. But some of the families in the traditional African - get back to the point. So you want to move that bitch and her bastard up in here where I pay the mortgage? I'm not understanding what this has to do with the temple because from what I know about traditional West African polygamy - Lord Jesus have mercy - the man supports the family. No, brother. I make the money. And here she laughed. What you're proposing is pimping. And I am not a whore.

GROSS: Thank you for reading that. And that's Asali Solomon reading from her new novel, ""Disgruntled."" I love the way - he's gotten this woman pregnant. He wants to, like, move her in, with this new baby, into the family and basically be polygamist. And he's got this philosophy that's going to justify it. It's not like he was philandering. You know what I'm saying?

SOLOMON: (Laughter).

GROSS: He was being disloyal or unfaithful. It's like, no, no, it's like African tradition of polygamy. And it's - you know - I - there's the hippie version of that, too. (Laughter).

SOLOMON: Oh, yes, of course, of course.

GROSS: There's the white hippie version of that.

SOLOMON: Yeah, that's not - that's not specific to - I mean, you know, this scenario is specific to black people. But I don't think that impulse to sort of, like, rationalize your behavior with, you know, some greater philosophy is, you know - I think that's a universal desire. But I also want to say, just as a side note, that, apparently, is my father's favorite scene in the book.

GROSS: Really?

SOLOMON: He thought that was hilarious.

(LAUGHTER)

SOLOMON: He laughs just talking about it. So I'm glad I got a chance to read it.

GROSS: But I'm interested in hearing why you wanted a scene like that - why you thought that the next step for this character who's writing this great philosophical text that's, in some ways, just removing him from any responsibility 'cause he's always busy writing this great philosophical text - why the next step would be this elaborate philosophical justification for his philandering.

SOLOMON: Yeah. I mean, Johnbrown's activism and his philosophy has an interesting relationship to his personal story, which is that he had these distant, mean, snobby parents who wanted him to be, you know, respectable middle-class in this way that, ultimately, is racially self-loathing. And it hurt him. And so a lot of what he does is reasonable on some level, you know, considering racism and police brutality and these kinds of things. But on some levels, it's extended acting out against his parents. And so he feels justified in making these moves that are kind of self-serving through this political, you know - through a sort of political rationalization. And so it starts with this extended acting out against his parents. And it continues with this kind of thing, you know - acting out in his family life in the family that he's built.

GROSS: Did you know people who tried to justify breaking monogamy with, you know, elaborate philosophical...

SOLOMON: I don't know anybody personally. But I have certainly heard that - you know, certainly heard that it's not natural, you know? I mean - and so, like, you keep saying the hippie version. But, you know, it's not natural for men to be monogamous. And so I've heard people talk about them in sense of thinking about African families and people who are not sort of properly interested in what that polygamy looks like, which is what Sheila points out - but just generally thinking, like, well, you know, I - mixing just their desire to - with something that's broader, you know, and more profound.

GROSS: The daughter in your novel - the main character, Kenya - ends up going to a private school in Philadelphia's Main Line that's in Bryn Mawr?

SOLOMON: That's right.

GROSS: And - As you did.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: And for her, it's this - it's a kind of life-changing experience, both in terms of this new form of alienation that she's never experienced before - but also, she gets a terrific education there. And how - like, what was going to a predominately white private school like for you?

SOLOMON: So it was obviously alienating in a lot of ways. I mean, I certainly got an excellent education. But I guess it took me a long time to understand the mix of feelings I have about that. It's something I've written about a lot and thought about a lot because the school - it was a great school. It was, you know - aesthetically, it was beautiful. We got to do - I got to do so many things, you know? But I always felt just kind of cold and out of it there. I often felt just kind of cold and out of it.

And there were things that were clearly - you know, that could clearly explain this. Like, you know, people really would ask me questions about the city. Like, were there pools of blood on the ground? And people would say things that were either subtly or not-so-subtly racist. And class was a big issue, right? A lot of the kids were wealthy. And we weren't poor, but we weren't wealthy. We didn't have a lot of money. And, you know, that was just something that was always there, you know? I was very nervous about people coming to my house, which, in a lot of cases, they were not even allowed to do 'cause they weren't allowed to, like, come to West Philadelphia.

But I think that - recently, I thought - I was thinking about how to articulate it. And I would say that in that situation, I and a lot of the other black students were just marginal because we were black. We would never be at the core of the social experience of that school, I felt, because we were black. And that sense only would increase as - I mean, I didn't go to high school there. But I imagine it would have only increased as people got into dating 'cause they weren't going to be dating out there, you know?

GROSS: Well, in the novel, the girl's thinking everybody's doing everything possible to separate her from the white boys.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: And you get the feeling everybody in her family...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...As well as people in the school - 'cause her parents don't want her dating somebody who's white.

SOLOMON: Yeah. Well - but then the other part of it is that there were black boys - and this was the case, you know, when I went to Baldwin - there were black boys sort of on the scene, you know? But they were not interested either. You know, I mean, there was this phenomenon that would occur when I went to school dances that I think I've documented pretty extensively, where you would have a sprinkling of black students. But the black boys did not want anybody to know that they were black. They would - you, like, by asking a black girl to - like, if you asked a black girl to dance, that would be like admitting that you were black. Obviously, they were black. It was, you know - but they couldn't ask a white girl to dance because there was something off about that. So they would often ask, like, sort of ethnically indeterminate girls...

GROSS: (Laughter).

SOLOMON: ...To dance, you know what I mean (laughter)? You know - but this kind of weird politicking that would go on. So it was - yeah. So, I mean - and so, like, I imagine - so in middle school, you know, there's not so much dating. And it's not really such - so much about a kind of sexual hierarchy. There are other things. But it's very difficult to fit in when you're just different and, you know, you can't afford or your parents won't buy the same things that everybody else is wearing. You're not going on ski trips. And, you know, it's just - everyone just thinks of you as different because you're black. But they're never saying it.

GROSS: Do you think you were exposed to ideas and books that you wouldn't have been exposed to had you stayed in a neighborhood public school?

SOLOMON: Yes, definitely. I mean, that's just - you know, I remember reading ""Jane Eyre"" in sixth grade. And then later, you know, I read it in high school. And I already read that. And I started taking French in fourth grade. I mean, sure - that definitely happened.

GROSS: And that's a good thing?

SOLOMON: Yeah. It was a good thing. It was a good thing. But it's very - I mean, it's - the thing that's difficult about, quote, unquote, ""good schools"" where you feel alienated or socially marginal is that depending on who you are as a person, you can make it out of that, you know, and write fiction about it (laughter) - write fiction about the pain you experienced in that. But a different kind of person won't necessarily get the benefit of the education because they're so broken as a person by that experience. So that's a kind of risk there.

GROSS: So your name, Asali, is a Swahili word for honey. So your parents intentionally gave you an African name. When it came time for you to name your children, how did you decide what level of symbolism you wanted those names to have?

SOLOMON: So they both have African names. I have a son, Adebayo - his name is Yoruba. It's apparently a somewhat popular name in Nigeria. A funny story about that is I have a British friend who said, oh - and it means born at a joyful time - and he said, oh, to us, it means bratty, overpaid, you know, football player (laughter), you know, 'cause in Europe - in England - like, apparently there are football - soccer players named Adebayo. But Oncale means ancestor. That's Swahili. And they both have my last name for their middle name. And their last name is Friedman. It's a Jewish name. So it's kind of all in there.

GROSS: Great.

(LAUGHTER)

GROSS: It's been wonderful to talk with you. Thank you so much.

SOLOMON: Thank you.

A BBC journalist tweeted Wednesday that Queen Elizabeth II had been admitted to King Edward VII’s Hospital in London, leading at least one other major news outlet — CNN — to tell its affiliates that the queen had been hospitalized and setting off speculation that she had died.

The queen is apparently fine and is not in the hospital. The backstory, according to the BBC, is that it was conducting “a technical rehearsal for an obituary” and “tweets were mistakenly sent from the account of a BBC journalist.”

The BBC has apologized. CNN, which tweeted the “news” without citing any source, subsequently told affiliates to “please disregard our previous tweet about Queen Elizabeth. It was sent in error.”

Poynter’s Benjamin Mullin has more here.

We should note that “there but for the grace of God go we.” But this is also a reminder of why, as the Ethics Handbook says, we do not “just spread information” we see on social media, even if it’s posted by usually reliable news outlets. We are “careful and skeptical.”

Here’s part of what we say in the handbook:

“When determining whether to pass along information being reported on social media sites by other news outlets or individuals, be thoughtful. When we point to what others are saying, in the eyes of many we are effectively reporting that information ourselves. … “Above all, proceed with caution, especially when news is breaking and accounts vary widely about what is happening. Reach out to other sources for confirmation. And the general standard is simple: Tweet and retweet as if what you’re saying or passing along is information that you would put on the air or in a ‘traditional’ NPR.org news story. If it needs context, attribution, clarification or ‘knocking down,’ provide it. “News moves fast on the Internet, and we know that speed and accuracy are fierce rivals, so keep your guard up. Ask questions, report and engage as you would in any public setting.

The rain fell for days, sometimes 3 inches or more in a single hour, as streets became rivers and rivers ate up entire neighborhoods in southeast Louisiana.

Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, more than 20 inches of rain fell in and around East Baton Rouge, one of the hardest-hit parishes. And in some parishes in the region, as much as 2 feet of rain fell in 48 hours.

The National Weather Service says the likelihood that so much rain would fall in so little time was about one-tenth of 1 percent. A flood this bad should only happen once every thousand years.

As The Two-Way has reported, at least 13 people have died in the floods and some 60,000 homes were damaged. The Red Cross says it is likely the worst natural disaster since Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and that the response will cost at least $30 million.

As the water recedes, many local leaders, weather forecasters and Louisiana residents are wondering whether people could have been better warned.

Tracking the storm

How a storm develops dictates who is responsible for warning people about it.

This storm began as an area of low pressure over the Gulf of Mexico, where hurricanes are born, so from the beginning, the National Hurricane Center in Miami was monitoring it.

""Our job at the National Hurricane Center is to forecast the strength and size of tropical cyclones,"" explains James Franklin, the chief of forecast operations at the National Hurricane Center, who has worked on hurricane forecasting since the 1980s. He used to fly into storms as part of the agency's airborne reconnaissance team. These days, he tries to steer clear of tropical storms and help others do the same.

But this Gulf storm never became a hurricane. The wind speeds were very low. The middle of the system wasn't warmer than the edges, and air wasn't circulating around the center of the system the way it would in a cyclone.

So the National Hurricane Center did not issue an advisory.

This video shows NASA rainfall data from Aug. 8 to Aug. 15. More than 20 inches of rain fell in the areas depicted in pink on the map.

NASA via YouTube

""If a disturbance or weather event is not a depression zone or a hurricane, we don't write advisories on it,"" Franklin says. ""It's not our authority to write advisories on things that are not hazardous cyclones.""

And he points out, ""The best place to get local information is always the local office, even when the National Hurricane Center has written an advisory. The local office has the best information about local flood risk.""

In this case, the local New Orleans/Baton Rouge National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office says it recognized the potential for flooding as early as Aug. 8. On that day — nearly three days before the storm arrived — it began issuing advisories and warnings about heavy rain. One rainfall map warned of ""isolated flash flooding"" later in the week.

Between Tuesday and Friday, when the first flash-flood emergencies were issued, the local weather service office for Baton Rouge says it issued at least a dozen advisories and warnings about flooding in southeastern Louisiana.

Kenneth Graham, the meteorologist in charge at the local office of the National Weather Service, says the situation was particularly difficult for forecasters trying to provide block-by-block clarity to residents. ""We broke all records,"" he writes in an email to NPR. ""For the River Flood Warnings, there is no way to reference any previous flood event since there is no history to draw from.""

In the town of Denham Springs, the Amite River crested 4.5 feet above the previous record, and Graham explains that because the terrain is so featureless around Baton Rouge, ""the water spreads out very far from the river,"" affecting an enormous area and tens of thousands of people.

By Aug. 11, Graham's office had decided to do something it rarely does — elevate the flash-flood warnings for areas around Baton Rouge to flash-flood emergencies, which can be issued only when there is significant and immediate threat to life and property.

Still, some residents say they were not adequately warned of the severity of the storm.

Baton Rouge resident Linda Smith tells Ryan Kailath of member station WWNO that she would have heeded more-urgent notifications. She and her family barely escaped their home before it flooded.

""We got no calls, no texts, no nothing,"" Smith says. ""So that's why I didn't panic because I didn't hear a siren. I didn't hear anything.""

It's important not to focus on the name or classification [of a storm], and instead focus on the hazards. Not everything that can be deadly or catastrophic is a tropical cyclone.

More than a dozen people died and no one was evacuated from the area before the most serious rainfall began.

The storm with no name

Tropical storms and hurricanes are assigned names by the National Hurricane Center, which draws attention to the storms. ""There certainly is more visibility that comes from cyclone,"" says Franklin of the National Hurricane Center. One reason for that, he says, is that the name and category designations — such as Hurricane Katrina, Category 5 — are more likely to be picked up by the media.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards told the New Orleans Times-Picayune, ""When you have a storm that is unnamed — it wasn't a hurricane, it wasn't a tropical event — people underestimate the impact that it would have.""

""It's important not to focus on the name or classification [of a storm], and instead focus on the hazards,"" Franklin says. ""Not everything that can be deadly or catastrophic is a tropical cyclone.""

Franklin acknowledges that the National Weather Service shares responsibility for communicating storm hazards to the media. ""There are often a lot of mixed signals out there, because the media is really focused on what [the National Hurricane Center] is saying about a storm, instead of the local office,"" he says.

The metrics that forecasters use to describe storms can also be confusing if people don't understand the on-the-ground effects of a storm in their neighborhood. Franklin says his agency is rolling out a new storm-surge-warning system next year to highlight that hazard more clearly.

But when it comes to communicating about flooding, he thinks the information forecasters provide is already pretty clear.

""We have some pretty good metrics for rainfall,"" he says. ""It's called inches.""

Many local newspapers, television stations and radio broadcasters in the Baton Rouge area began warning residents of potentially serious flooding on Aug. 11, the day the local NWS issued emergency warnings.

As for national media outlets, many were late to the scene and slow in their coverage.

Craig Fugate, the administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told the Times-Picayune newspaper last Tuesday, ""You have the Olympics. You got the election. If you look at the national news, you're probably on the third or fourth page. ... We think it is a national headline disaster.""

Reflecting on NPR's own coverage of the flooding, Vice President of News Michael Oreskes said it was both swift and thorough.

Oreskes says:

""As the water rose NPR turned to our member stations in Baton Rouge and New Orleans for immediate news coverage by Friday, Aug. 12. By that Sunday, NPR's Southern correspondent, Debbie Elliot, had arrived from her home in Alabama, navigating around floodwaters on remote parish roads to get into Amite and Baton Rouge.""

The New York Times published its first story by a staff reporter on the evening of Aug. 14. Last week, the public editor of The Times published an apology for the newspaper's lack of timely coverage. She wrote:"

KURTIS: Peter started by sucking up even more than usual.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SAGAL: Well, I'm not - I, like so many other people, grew up watching you. You were a huge part of my childhood and my life. And that's true of so many people. So do people meet you and freak out, like I'm about to?

CAROL BURNETT: (Laughter) No, but you know what's really neat is because of YouTube and also, you know, that our DVDs have been released, I'm getting fan mail from 9-year-olds...

SAGAL: Really?

BURNETT: ...Ten-year-olds, teenagers. And I go around the country and I do Q and A's, questions and answers like I used to at the beginning of the show. And not too long ago, I was in Texas and this little boy in the second row raised his hand. He had a question. I said, hi. I said, but first, how old are you? And he said 9. And I said (laughter) and you know who I am? And he said, surprisingly, yes.

(LAUGHTER)

AMY DICKINSON: Amazing.

SAGAL: So I was watching your show and - the earliest episodes - and there was just, in that '60s way, just this slightly risque - like, there's a joke when you're doing your family sketch with Harvey playing your husband where you're so excited 'cause you have the evening to yourselves and you're going to do something. And he reads the paper.

BURNETT: Right.

SAGAL: So did you ever try to do something they wouldn't let you do?

BURNETT: No, actually we were really - we didn't get censored. And the suits - by that I mean, you know, the vice president of CBS, executives and so forth - they never bothered us. They - we would do our run-through and we'd have the censor there - he was terrific. His name was Charlie Petitjean (ph) and he was - he was just - we loved him and he loved us. And we never gave him any grief. But there was one time (laughter) we were doing a sketch where I was a nudist.

And I was standing behind a fence that said keep out and my shoulders were bare. And you could see my legs, and I had on high-top sneakers. And Harvey was interviewing me a la Edward R. Murrow, OK? And so we're just doing jokes, you know, it was just jokes. And (laughter) Harvey - one of the jokes was Harvey said, so, what do you nudists do for recreation? And I said, well, we have dances every Saturday night. And his line was, well, how do you nudists dance? And my line was, very carefully.

(LAUGHTER)

BURNETT: Well, Charlie Petitjean thought that was fine. But the higher-ups, you know, the program practice's - his boss said, oh, it's too risque. I mean, you got to change that. I mean, please. Anyway, so we had to go back to the drawing board. So this is what we came up with and CBS bought it. We said - he said, how do you nudists dance? And I said, cheek to cheek.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Hey – oh, it was a classier time. So...

BURNETT: That's what we wanted in the first place, but we never thought they'd buy it.

DICKINSON: Weird.

SAGAL: I saw an interview once - I want to establish this - in which somebody asked you for the secret to success and happiness at a certain age, and you said the secret is to marry a much younger man.

BURNETT: (Laughter) Yeah.

SAGAL: And that's worked out for you.

BURNETT: It certainly has.

SAGAL: Yeah, keeps you on your toes.

BURNETT: Yeah, keeps him on his toes, too.

SAGAL: Yeah, do you ever - I can imagine. Do you ever pat him on the head and say, oh, you wouldn't understand. You're too young.

BURNETT: No, not at all. That's why we're together.

SAGAL: Oh, good. Well, Carol, we read that Lucille Ball was a mentor of yours early on. What advice did she give you?

BURNETT: She was 22 years older than I, so she called me kid, OK? And so one time she was on my show and we were having dinner before the orchestra rehearsal on Thursday night at the farmers market. She was knocking back a couple of whiskey sours. And she said, you know, kid, it's really great that you have Joe, who - I was married to Joe Hamilton, who was our producer. She said it's great you have Joe to run interference and all. She said, when I was married to the Cuban...

(LAUGHTER)

BURNETT: She said, you know, Desi did everything. All I had to do – he - you know, he worked on the scripts, he worked on the lighting, he worked on this - and he was very, very smart. And she says, so all I had to do on a Monday for the week was come in and be Lucy. And then they got a divorce. So now she was going to do some subsequent shows like ""The Lucy Show"" and ""The Lucille Ball Show"" and so forth and so on.

And so there she was, you know, Desi wasn't there and they were having a reading - a table reading on a Monday. And she said it was terrible. It stunk. And where was Desi? Well, (unintelligible) now I've got to confront. And then she realized she had to be strong. So she told everybody - the writers and everything - in no uncertain terms what she thought of that week's script - boom. And she looked at me and she said and, kid, that's when they put the S on the end of my last name.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, Carol Burnett, it is a pleasure and an honor to talk to you. But we're not done yet because we have invited you here to play a game that this time we're calling...

BURNETT: Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

KURTIS: (Growling).

SAGAL: So, as you mentioned, your husband's a little younger than you are. So we're going to ask you about actual cougars.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Get two right, you'll win a prize for one of our listeners - Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Carol Burnett playing for?

KURTIS: Dana Reeser of Frisco, Texas.

BURNETT: Dana, OK.

SAGAL: Are you ready to do this?

BURNETT: Yeah.

SAGAL: All right, first question. In 2014, a Colorado hiker being stalked by a cougar got it to run away. How did she do it? A - by telling it she wanted a commitment...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: …B, by pulling out a giant laser pointer and getting it to chase it away from her...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: …Or C, by singing opera to it 'cause we all know cougars hate opera.

BURNETT: I'd say she sang.

SAGAL: She did. She sang opera.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

DICKINSON: All right.

SAGAL: She says the cougar was getting really close so, quote, ""I just started singing opera really loud. It put its ears down and backed away.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, Carol, that's very good. You have two more questions. John Cougar Mellencamp, the singer, born without that middle name - just John Mellencamp - how did he acquire that name, John Cougar Mellencamp? A, when he was 7, he exclusively dated 5 and 6-year-olds...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: …B, his first demo tape was just him growling, or C, he found out it was his new name when he looked at his first record.

BURNETT: B.

SAGAL: His first demo was just him growling?

BURNETT: Mm-hm.

SAGAL: I think that would be hilarious. But, in fact, it was C.

BURNETT: Oh, no.

SAGAL: He actually told the story on our show some years ago. His manager in New York thought that his name, John Mellencamp, was too hayseed so changed his name to John Cougar without telling him.

BURNETT: Oh, how funny.

SAGAL: And John Cougar, as he was now named, found that out when he picked up his first record and looked at it and said, who's John Cougar? Oh, I am. All right, this is exciting…

BURNETT: Oh, dear.

SAGAL: …Because you have one more question, and if you get this one, you win for our listener. You can find cougars in lots of strange places. In 2013, the British tabloid The Daily Mail reported that a cougar had been found living where? A, as roommates with a very frightened freshman at Oberlin College in Ohio, B, on the set of the ABC show ""Cougartown,"" or C, in Cher's backyard.

BURNETT: I'll say C.

SAGAL: In Cher's backyard?

BURNETT: Yeah.

SAGAL: You're right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

POUNDSTONE: All right.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: The so-called Hollywood cougar lived in the LA area for three years, including in Cher's backyard before finally settling down with Ashton Kutcher. Bill, how did the legendary Carol Burnett do on our show?

KURTIS: Carol, you did very well, 2 out of 3 is a win in our book.

SAGAL: Congratulations.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: The first five seasons of ""The Carol Burnett Show"" are now out on DVD. You can pick them up. It's just like being back there. Carol Burnett, what an absolute pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much for joining us on WAIT WAIT ...DON'T TELL ME.

BURNETT: Believe me, it was my pleasure. You guys are terrific.

SAGAL: Thank you, Carol.

POUNDSTONE: Love you, Carol.

SAGAL: Bye-bye.

BURNETT: Thank you, bye.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Peter Schouten/Courtesy of the University of New South Wales Peter Schouten/Courtesy of the University of New South Wales

Paleontologists at the University of New South Wales in Australia say they have identified a tiny new species of marsupial lion that lived around 18 million years ago.

The extinct, squirrel-size animal weighed about 1.3 pounds, very likely lived in trees and had teeth that suggest it was capable of ripping apart other small creatures with its molars.

The researchers named it Microleo attenboroughi in honor of Sir David Attenborough, the famed British naturalist who has hosted numerous documentaries on wildlife.

As the researchers write in their study, published in the online journal Palaeontologia Electronica, the etymology of the name is:

""From micro meaning small (Greek) and leo meaning lion (Latin). The species name honors Sir David Attenborough for his dedication and enthusiasm in promoting the natural history of the world and the palaeontological treasures of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in particular.""

M. attenboroughi is the ninth, and smallest, marsupial lion species paleontologists have identified from fossils recovered at the Riversleigh World Heritage fossil site in Queensland, Australia. The first such species, Thylacoleo carnifex, which was identified in 1858 and more fully described in 1999, was much larger than the newly identified ""micro lion."" T. carnifex was about 5 feet long, 2 feet tall, and had the impressive ability to rip through prey with its jaws.

On its website, the Australian Museum describes T. carnifex's bite as ""the most powerful bite of any mammalian predator, living or extinct"" and says ""it could have taken prey much larger than itself.""

The other species range in size from that of a leopard down to the size of a dog. Over time, Australian marsupial lions grew in size, from the Miocene period, when the newly discovered lion species lived, up to the Pleistocene period, when T. carnifex hunted. At any given point over about 5 million years, no more than two species of Australian marsupial lion existed at the same time.

Marsupial lions are not the ancestors of modern lions living in parts of Africa, though they are related to modern marsupials such as koalas. The term ""lion"" refers instead to the status of the ancient hunters as dangerous carnivores, much like the current status of big cats.

M. attenboroughi is not alone in its honorific name among the prehistoric marsupial lions of Australia.

There's also Whollydooleya tomnpatrichorum, another recently discovered species. That animal, which is slightly larger than Attenborough's namesake and has sharper teeth, was discovered at a fossil site called Wholly Dooley. Its name pays tribute to Australian paleontologists Tom and Pat Rich."

David Greene talks to two top political strategists — Eric Fehrnstrom and Doug Hattaway — on what it takes to turn a campaign around, and if they think GOP nominee Donald Trump can do it.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

A lot of people are asking a question that has been asked before in presidential election years. Can the candidate who's behind come back? And if so, how? Donald Trump has been trailing Hillary Clinton. And we're going to hear now from two veteran campaign advisers who have confronted moments of trouble. In 2012, there was that leaked video of Republican candidate Mitt Romney essentially writing off 47 percent of the electorate. Romney came across as out-of-touch. Eric Fehrnstrom was his senior adviser.

ERIC FEHRNSTROM: It was a damaging event. And it made for a rough couple of weeks late in the campaign, in September. But then Romney turned in a superior performance in the first debate. And the campaign goes on like a tennis match, with the ball moving back and forth over the net. But with Trump and Clinton, it's a one-sided match. And that's because Trump is a bad tennis player.

GREENE: Now, we also spoke to Doug Hattaway. He joined Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign as senior communications adviser right after she finished a disappointing third in Iowa and was heading to New Hampshire.

DOUG HATTAWAY: She had been seen as sort of an aloof front-runner. And then the loss in Iowa really shook things up. But she became a different candidate and started to campaign in a different way and be more accessible and more aspirational. And she had time to do that.

GREENE: As for time, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have 76 days left until America votes.

FEHRNSTROM: I think we're at a stage now where the most valuable commodity that these campaigns have is time. And that is rapidly depleting. And every day in the presidential race is going to be measured by who won and who lost that day. And I think...

GREENE: But the debate is a time when you can turn things around. I mean, it is an opportunity for a campaign like this.

HATTAWAY: Yeah, I think it is. But its biggest deficit is the candidate and his character. And what's happened in the country is as people have gotten to know Donald Trump through this campaign, many people have decided he's unfit to be president. So I don't think the debates are actually going to help with that 'cause once people make a judgment about character versus your personality or your issues or something like that, it's hard to change a character judgment.

GREENE: Eric, is the debate the moment that - the sort of last-ditch effort for the Trump campaign?

FEHRNSTROM: Well, I think the debate is going to be a challenge for Donald Trump...

GREENE: I guess debates - we should say plural since there are a few of them.

FEHRNSTROM: Well, I think it's going to be quite different from the multi-candidate debates that he participated in during the primary, where his top talk time would have been - I don't know - eight minutes. But now he's going to have to carry half the show. And I think that's going to wear on him. Now, that's not to say that there aren't unknown variables out there. There are. Notes of Hillary Clinton's FBI interview were just released to a congressional committee. WikiLeaks...

GREENE: This is over the whole email thing, yeah.

FEHRNSTROM: Yeah, WikiLeaks say they still have more hacked emails from the DNC to release. Who knows what they contain? But you don't want to bank on unknown variables as the path that will take you to the White House. What you need is a good strategy. And you need strong execution against that strategy. And that's what Trump is lacking.

GREENE: Doug, I don't feel like we are seeing a whole lot of Hillary Clinton. The campaign seems to have decided that - let Donald Trump be out there in the spotlight, and let him do his thing if that seems to be working. Is that a fair characterization? And do you think that's a good strategy?

HATTAWAY: I think she's been campaigning consistently in the way that she wants to campaign, which I think is more aspirational, accessible than you've seen in the past. I think it is a good strategy for her. And her best strategy is to be aspirational and don't talk about Donald Trump.

GREENE: Don't talk about Donald Trump?

HATTAWAY: Yeah, everybody's sick of talking about Donald Trump, I think.

FEHRNSTROM: (Laughter).

HATTAWAY: Let him do his own thing. I think the growth opportunity for her is Republican women and independents who don't want anything to do with Trump and would be open to her. So I think that is, to some extent, the people who are on her mind as she's out there campaigning now.

And remember, of course, that's largely in battleground states. And I think she has some opportunities there. If you look at the numbers, about 4 out of 5 voters have said they've made up their mind. So there's not a lot of room for either to gain. But I think she has more opportunity to gain.

GREENE: But she - I mean, she too has incredibly high unfavorable ratings. I mean, Eric, are there opportunities there for her to win over some Republicans?

FEHRNSTROM: Well, you know, I think I would disagree with Doug a little bit here, maybe take a broader view of the election. I think the election is about risk versus change. Trump wants voters to believe that only he, as an outsider, can bring the change we need in Washington. And I think he's right about that.

Hillary Clinton doesn't even bother disputing that fact. But what she does argue is that electing Trump brings with it too much risk. So knowing that, Trump and the people in his campaign should be doing everything in their power to put voters at ease about what a Trump presidency would look like. It's not complicated.

GREENE: All right. Hey, thank you guys so much for talking to us. We really appreciate it.

HATTAWAY: Thank you.

FEHRNSTROM: Thank you.

GREENE: That was Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in 2012, and also Doug Hattaway, who was a senior communications adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008.

It’s been drilled into our heads that we should include at least a bit of a person’s biography on first reference. So this guidance is a break from tradition. Here goes:

If someone is well-known, it will often feel and sound more natural to move that bio material to later in a Newscast spot, blog post or show piece. In some cases it may not even be necessary to include all the biographical information you’re tempted to fold in.

For instance, rather than beginning with a reference to “2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin” or “former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin” or “former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin,” simply slip one of those reminders in later.

In most cases, there’s no need to remind the audience on first reference that Hillary Clinton is a “former secretary of state,” “former senator” or “former first lady.” You may need to say “Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton,” but there are more conversational ways to get that information across as well. For instance, by talking about “Hillary Clinton’s campaign for the White House” and getting the word “Democratic” in at another point.

It’s unlikely you would start a conversation with a friend by saying “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.” You would say “Bernie Sanders.” In many cases, we can do the same and let the references to his run for the Democratic nomination, the senate and Vermont come in naturally.

This guidance is mostly about politicians, but can apply to others as well. “Former Beatle” doesn’t always have to go in front of “Paul McCartney.” Oprah Winfrey can stand on her own for a line or two. “Boxer Muhammad Ali” may not be necessary on first reference.

Here’s the takeaway: We don’t have to be bound to the notion that first references must be mini résumés. Use your judgment.

Related notes:

– This does not change the way we refer to sitting presidents, vice presidents and other world leaders. We’re sticking with formalities on first references to them.

– Party IDs are key information in stories about policy makers and politicians. If you don’t include an “R,” a “D,” a “Democrat” or a “Republican,” you will hear from readers and listeners who say you’re trying to hide someone’s affiliation.

– If the news is about legislation that’s being introduced, a hearing that’s being held, results of an investigation that are being released or other official business, we stick with tradition. It would be “Sen. Jane Doe” or “Attorney Gen. John Doe” on first reference.

– It should always be “Conqueror of the Unpronounceable Word Korva Coleman” on first reference.

Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is known for his outspoken personality and oversize public image, which he believes help build his brand name.

""Whether it's good press or bad press, it's getting your name out there,"" Washington Post investigative reporter Michael Kranish tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. ""Getting your name on the gossip pages and the front pages and even the sports pages, [is] all in the effort of building the name.""

Kranish and his Post colleague Marc Fisher are the authors of Trump Revealed, a biography about Trump's life and career that is based on the work of more than 20 of the Post's reporters, editors and fact-checkers.

Fisher says 20 hours of interviews with Trump helped him come to a better understanding of the candidate. ""The man we've come to know and understand is someone who has led a strikingly solitary life given how public he is and how glad-handing his image is,"" Fisher said. ""When I asked him about friendships, he said he really doesn't have friendships of the kind that most people would describe.""

Interview Highlights

On what Trump was like as a kid

Marc Fisher: He was, by both his friends' description and his own, a rambunctious kid who got in trouble a lot and who was a bit of a ruffian. From the youngest age, about age 6 or 7, he pelted the neighbor's toddler with rocks from across the yard. He pulled the pigtails of a classmate. He got into a physical altercation with one of his teachers, and so he was someone who was kind of a rambunctious kid, even obnoxious by some accounts, and he says that he hasn't changed since second grade. So that kind of in-your-face provocateur character that we've come to see in the campaign is something that traces back very cleanly and consistently to this childhood as kind of a tough kid.

On how a lawsuit that charged his father's real estate company with racial bias influenced Trump's business philosophy

Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

Michael Kranish: This was a very serious lawsuit, one of the most significant racial bias cases at the time, and it's very interesting. We were able to obtain, under Freedom of Information Act requests, all of the transcripts for this court case. What happened was, Donald had to decide, was he going to settle this case or was he going to fight the federal government? One night in Manhattan he walked into a nightclub that he belonged to, and there was a man named Roy Cohn, and Roy Cohn of course is the famous or infamous lawyer who was the aide to Joseph McCarthy of the Army-McCarthy hearings that was held in the 1950s. Donald got to talking to Roy Cohn and told him about this racial bias case brought by the federal government, and Cohn, who himself had fought the federal government many times in his career, said: ""Don't settle. Fight like hell. When they hit you, hit back 10 times harder.""

The bottom line is, after this discussion at the nightclub, Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

On Trump using a pseudonym to be his own press agent

Fisher: So what happened is in an effort to kind of spread his image around the city and around the country eventually, Donald Trump would act as his own press agent. He would call reporters as ""John Miller"" or ""John Barron,"" he wouldn't bother even to disguise his voice, but he would call them up and say, ""Donald Trump is going to be out at this club with this amazing celebrity or this model,"" or ""Donald Trump is going to be groundbreaking for a new building."" And he would kind of gin up press coverage as this alter ego, and he would also call reporters to complain about their stories or to encourage them to think about Donald Trump in a better light. ...

Some of the reporters who got these calls knew that it was Trump, and they thought this was kind of weird, but they went along with it; others didn't know. We were lucky enough to get a recording that someone sent me of one of these calls in which he presents himself as John Miller to a reporter for People magazine and if you listen to the recording, it sounds astonishingly like Donald Trump because it is Donald Trump. He carries this on as if no one knows what his very distinctive voice sounds like, and he talks about Donald Trump in this very extremely complimentary way and about what a ladies' man he is, and how women can't stop themselves from coming to him and seeking to go out with him, and this is something that he did for many, many years.

On Trump's debt in the 1990s

Kranish: [The banks] really felt that if they basically forced Donald Trump to repay his debts that they were going to lose everything themselves. Donald Trump had such extraordinary leverage that there came a day when the bankers were concerned that Donald Trump did not have insurance on his yacht, which he bought for some $20 million. Trump's associates basically told the bank, ""Look, you need to pay for the insurance on the yacht, because if something happens to it, you'll have nothing."" He eventually got the bank to pay insurance that Donald Trump himself didn't have. Similarly, Donald Trump had five helicopters the banks wanted to take back. For a time, he actually hid those five helicopters, because he was concerned they'd be swept up by the banks. Eventually they were turned over, but it just shows you the difficult times that Donald Trump was having at that time.

On Trump's business model of selling his name and his image

Fisher: Over time, what Donald Trump learned was that he could do all these things for himself. So the big question is, is he capable of doing this for anyone other than himself? And the track record really makes me kind of skeptical about that, because what we have is someone who, throughout his career, has found ways to enrich himself at the expense of others.

What Donald Trump learned from that experience in New York and Atlantic City was that he could build his entire business model around this idea of selling his image and his name. The more he got people to believe that his image was worth millions, the more he would be able to go out and sell just his name. So many of his latter day projects over the last couple of decades, in fact most of them, do not involve Donald Trump building anything, do not involve Donald Trump creating jobs, they involve Donald Trump going to a developer and saying, ""I will sell you my name that you can put on your building that you have invested in, with your money, and that you will give me a steady, guaranteed income flow."" That's the arrangement he had on many if not most of his building projects in the United States and around the world that have been done in the last 10, 20 years, and similarly with all the other businesses that he's gotten into, whether it's selling medicines or selling a university that he created. All of these things are cases where his involvement on a day-to-day basis is marginal or even nonexistent — what he's sold is the name, and he gets a set multimillion-dollar fee every year that's guaranteed, even if the project fails."

Kadohata is the Newbery Medal-winning author of the YA novel ""Kira-Kira."" For our ""Next Chapter"" series, she talks about an eye-opening bus trip she took across the U.S. right before she left home.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Do you remember the moment when you left home for good? This month, many young people will be experiencing that moment as they shoulder their bags and head off to college. And throughout August, we're bringing you stories and advice about that pivotal moment from authors who've written for young adults. It's a series we call Next Chapter. Today, we hear from Cynthia Kadohata. She's the Newbery Medal-winning author of ""Kira-Kira"" and ""Half A World Away."" And she says the common thread in all her books is that they focus on something that moves her.

CYNTHIA KADOHATA: I love dogs a lot, so I wrote a book called ""Cracker!"" about the dogs who served in Vietnam.

MARTIN: Kadohata was 17 years old when she dropped out of high school. For the next few years, she lived at home in LA and went to community college, then she finished her undergraduate degree at a four-year university. She was in her 20s when she decided she wanted to leave home and start a new life in Boston. The year was 1981.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""BADLANDS"")

KADOHATA: I had taken a month-long bus trip - Greyhound bus trip shortly before I left Los Angeles. And I really saw the country as I had never seen it before.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BADLANDS"")

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Lights out tonight, trouble in the heartland, got a head-on collision smashing in my guts, man. I'm caught in...

KADOHATA: For me, going on this bus trip was one of the real pivotal times in my life. I met people who I never would have ordinarily met. I was on a bus with a woman in her 80s who said she was dying, and this was going to be her last trip that she would ever take. She had lived in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl years and gone to California to pick fruit. And I was just fascinated by her life. We talked for hours on the bus, and she hugged me afterwards. I remember we were standing in, I think it was Texas somewhere, and they were grasshoppers hopping all over the parking lot. And she hugged me and told me to have a good life.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT"")

KADOHATA: And just meeting her somehow changed my whole vision of America, I think. I mean, I had always lived in America. But I didn't have an awareness, really, of being an American so much as I did when I talked to these people. And I saw that each person has their own story which is unique and incredibly valuable to hear about. And that was when I started to think that I wanted to be a writer.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

KADOHATA: You should find whatever it is you feel passionate about, and find people who inspire you, who will mentor you and help you through whatever decisions you have to make.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Well they're still racing out at the trestles. But that blood, it never burned in her veins.

MARTIN: That's Cynthia Kadohata. We've been hearing music from Bruce Springsteen's ""Darkness On The Edge of Town,"" an album Kadahota says was very important to her when she left home. She is part of our series Next Chapter.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Well, if she wants to see me, you can tell her that I'm easily found. Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge. Tell her there's a darkness on the edge of town. There's a darkness on the edge of town.

Well, everybody's got a secret, son - something that they just can't face...

The man under arrest in Kalamazoo is a “suspect.” He “allegedly” killed six people.

The basic procedure is that we use such qualifiers, or others such as “who police say …,” until someone is convicted or has entered a guilty plea.

Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik are not “suspects” or “alleged” killers. They are the couple who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.

They were not convicted and did not confess to authorities. Why drop the qualifiers?

Because they’re dead?

That’s a factor, but not necessarily the determining one.

As we’ve said before, ”at some point … it just makes common sense to stop inserting” words such as “suspected” and “allegedly.”

But as we’ve also said before, here are some of the “questions to ask before any shift in language:”

– Has the person [or persons] been positively and publicly identified as the killer[s] by proper authorities?

– Have authorities ruled out the possibility of someone else being involved?

– Were there many witnesses? (In other words, did dozens or more see this unfold?)

– Is there considerable video evidence? …

– Has the inevitable confusion that comes when such events happen been resolved? Often, for example, witnesses and authorities initially get things wrong — including the name of the person responsible.

Ed Yong, author of I Contain Multitudes, says someday we might be able to improve our health by taking probiotics, but ""we are still in the very early stages of working out how to do this.""

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You may think you know who you are, but you don't really unless you're aware of the fact that there are trillions of microbes living on and in you. They affect your digestion, immunity, body weight and overall health. Scientists are researching what those microbes do and how we might be able to improve our health by manipulating the balance of those microbes. The ecosystem of microbes within humans and animals is the subject of the new book ""I Contain Multitudes"" by science writer Ed Yong. He writes about science for The Atlantic and writes a science blog hosted by National Geographic called ""Not Exactly Rocket Science.""

Ed Yong, welcome to FRESH AIR. So as you say, our body is really an ecosystem. What are some of the different communities of microbes on and in our bodies?

ED YONG: Well, there are tens of trillions of them all together, but they vary from one part to the other because, for example, my forearm is a quite a dry environment. It's a bit parched like a desert whereas something like my mouth or the inside of my nose is a hot and humid environment that's more like a rain forest. And each of these places harbors a very different community of microbes.

GROSS: And a lot of those bacteria - a lot of those microbes are good guys, helping your body do what it needs to do. But as you point out, if one of the good guy bacteria gets into the wrong spot, it becomes a bad guy.

YONG: That's right. We've had this long-standing idea that microbes are germs, are enemies that we need to destroy lest they destroy us. But actually we're coming to realize that many of these microbes are profoundly important for our lives. But I wanted to get across in the book that there isn't really any such thing as a good microbe or a bad microbe. They just live with us. They are our partners in life and they can often do us tremendous amounts of good. They can help to digest our food and tune our immune system and protect us from disease. But if they get in the wrong place or if our relationship with them breaks down, then they might also do us harm.

GROSS: So when we're talking about the microbes in the microbiome, obviously we're talking about bacteria. What else are we including in that?

YONG: So bacteria form the majority of them, but there are also another group of microbes called Archaea, which look very similar but are actually very, very different. There are single-celled fungi. There are protists. There are viruses, too, in huge numbers. Some people might not think of them as part of the microbiome, but they are there, too, and they are incredibly influential.

GROSS: I want to talk with you about probiotics. So many people take probiotics in the hopes of having a healthy gut. And among scientists who actually study the microbiome, which is the microbes living in the gut, it's actually pretty controversial whether probiotics accomplish anything. So let's start with what are probiotics supposed to do?

YONG: So probiotics are products that contain beneficial microbes, and they have all sorts of health claims attached to them, but actually if you look at the evidence behind these products, they tend to be a bit medically underwhelming. So they're good for certain types of infectious diarrhea but not a huge amount else. And even regulators in the U.S. and the - and in Europe have taken a dim view of many of these health claims. And I think that's because probiotics contain typically small numbers of microbes, much fewer than already exist in your body.

A lot of these species are being chosen for historical reasons because they're easy to manufacture and package, not because they're excellent at establishing themselves in the gut. And often they're very industrialized, very proprietary strains. You know, they enter and then they disappear or they pass through. They don't have a huge amount of impact. And yet, the idea behind probiotics, the idea that we might be able to give ourselves beneficial bacteria that improve our health, that idea has a lot of potential, and it is solid.

But we are still in the very early stages of working out how to do this. It is about engineering an entire ecosystem. It's about - it's as complicated some say, like, changing a coral reef or a grassland. It's a - it's about sculpting a world.

GROSS: So when we take a probiotic that we bought in a store, are the bacteria in that probiotic likely to repopulate in our gut?

YONG: No, they're not. Typically, they don't manage to establish themselves, and they don't last for a long time, so they're not very good colonizers.

GROSS: And are they microbes that typically live in our gut?

YONG: They're microbes that can be found in the gut. But they're not - they're not the A-listers. They're not the ones that are especially common or especially good at colonizing the gut.

GROSS: What about yogurt, which usually has active cultures in it, probiotic cultures?

YONG: Same thing. Studies have shown that you swallow them and those bacteria then disappear. They - I think of them as, like, a breeze that blows between two open windows. It might rattle a couple of objects in the way, but it doesn't have a lasting impact.

GROSS: You're depressing me.

(LAUGHTER)

YONG: I'm sorry.

GROSS: OK. When you take antibiotics, the antibiotics kill off a lot of the bacteria in your body, including ones that you would prefer to have and some of those bacteria that you'd prefer to have live in your gut. And I think that's at least one of the reasons why taking antibiotics can lead to diarrhea because it kills off some of the bacteria that keeps your gut in balance. And that's usually a time when even doctors who don't especially believe in probiotics still recommend that you take it. So what's the common wisdom now among scientists who are actually studying this about the value of taking probiotics as an antidote to antibiotics?

YONG: Well, so some types of antibiotic-associated diarrhea involve this very nasty, weedy bacterium called Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, which is very good in invading guts that have been repeatedly assaulted with antibiotics and can cause recurring intractable cases of diarrhea. And actually one of the best treatments for C. diff - oh, and in fact, one of the most successful microbiome-based treatments we have is a thing called a fecal transplant. A fecal transplant is almost exactly what it sounds like. You're trying to take the stool from a healthy donor and implant it into the gut of someone who's sick. And you are doing that almost as a way of resetting their inner ecosystem, of replacing a community that has been faltering, much like trying to re-turf a lawn that's been overrun with dandelions or other weeds.

GROSS: And how is that being done now? It's been in its experimental stages, but I think they're kind of perfecting ways of doing it without being - without it being as gross as it sounds.

YONG: So the traditional way is to use actual stool and it can be delivered either up the bum or down the nose via a tube. And, you know, it does have this ick factor attached to it. But it is also spectacularly effective at treating infections of Clostridium difficile - C. diff - this very invasive, weedy bacterium that can cause recurring severe diarrhea. In one now classic study, some 20 - or 27 percent of people who took a common antibiotic were cured of C. diff infections whereas those who receive fecal transplant, about 94 percent of them were cured. So we're in this weird position where the number one treatment for C. diff is a number two. And...

GROSS: (Laughter).

YONG: ...Fecal transplants are - have been - have done wonders for this particular condition. Whether it works for other diseases - so in - so following the successes with C. diff, scientists and doctors have tried fecal transplants for a large number of other conditions that have been linked to the microbiomes, things like inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome.

And there, the results are less - certainly less successful, a bit less consistent. And that's probably because those types of diseases - those ecosystems inside us - are more difficult to reset. So others - other researchers are now trying to take the concept behind fecal transplants and refine it to pull out the bacteria and other microbes that are conferring the benefits to the recipients without having to bother with the gross fecal bit.

So several companies have developed pills that are - you can think of them either as, like, pared-down stool or souped-up probiotics, right? So they are communities of microbes that are meant to replicate a lot of the benefits of doing a stool.

But recently, one of the most leading contenders for these fake poop pills flunked out of a major clinical trial, which I think emphasizes how little we know still about why this age-old procedure actually works and how early we are in the process of actually manipulating our microbiomes in order to improve our health.

GROSS: Did you say this was an age-old procedure?

YONG: Yeah. Well, it first started - I think the first records were from China several centuries ago. And people have sort of rediscovered it time and again. And it's only become - I'm not going to say popular - but certainly more prominent in the last 10 - maybe even five - years or so.

GROSS: So why is it that a fecal transplant might be more effective than a probiotic pill?

YONG: So there, you're using a much wider community of microbes. And you are giving them in large numbers. And you're using the ones that are naturally there in the gut anyway. So it's a much more realistic community to implant in a person. But, you know, the real answer to this question is we still don't entirely know.

We don't really know which components of stool - which members of that community - are really doing good, how they might interact with the native microbes in a recipient's gut or with the gut itself, with the immune system of the host.

There are still so many questions that we have left to answer. All we know is that for this one particular condition, C. diff infections, it seems to be a very, very good treatment with few known side effects, if any. And that's very cheap.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" Let's take a short break. And then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and has a science blog for National Geographic called ""Not Exactly Rocket Science.""

Microbes can contribute to our immune system. And you describe how microbes can trigger inflammation. And microbes can also suppress inflammation. Can you give us a sense of the interplay between those two sets of microbes and how they regulate our immune system, for better and for worse?

YONG: Right. So we typically think of the immune system as this militaristic force that defends us from the microbes in the world around us. And yet we see that certain types of microbes help to build parts of the immune system. And then they also calibrate it.

So they strike this balance between reacting - between protecting ourselves from infections - but also not overreacting. So they help - some species help to stop the immune system from going berserk at harmless things in our environment like pollen or dust, things that might trigger allergies.

And that balance between inflammation and anti-inflammation is very much affected by our microbes. They set that tipping point, much like the thermostat in my house might control the temperature of a room and keep it stable.

GROSS: So this interaction between microbes that suppress inflammation and those that trigger it are being studied in germ-free mice, mice that are meant to have a controlled environment within them because they're germ free. How do you create a germ-free mouse?

YONG: You raise them in the sterile isolators, these plastic bubbles that are completely disconnected from the microbial world. The mice are the only things living inside them. They have sterile food, sterile water. Anything that's put in gets sterilized before it's connected to these chambers.

And I think that makes these mice some of the strangest animals on the planet. I visited one of the facilities that raises them. And I held one not with my bare hands but with this black rubber glove that protrudes into their plastic bubble. And this is an animal that, unlike anything else - unlike you or me or an elephant or an - anything - has no microbe.

It's like a silhouette that hasn't been filled in yet. And because of that, it has a lot of problems. It has different - it has problems with its bones, its blood vessels, its gut, its behavior. It testifies, I think, to just how important microbes are for sculpting and shaping our bodies and how much can go wrong if we live our lives in their absence.

GROSS: So what kind of experiments on immunity and inflammation are being conducted on these germ-free mice?

YONG: And so, for example, you can give them specific microbes and see which types of immune cells rise to the fore, like what - whether you see an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory response. And we can see that certain microbes can actually tune down inflammation which is an odd concept because I think we think of microbes as foreign, as other, as things that trigger information. Whereas we see with rodent experiments that some species that live with us are actually capable of quenching inflammatory fires, so they are capable of calming the immune system and saying I come in peace.

GROSS: What are the implications of this for autoimmune diseases, diseases in which the body attacks healthy body cells?

YONG: So theres a growing body of evidence suggesting that early exposures to a wide range of microbes is important for carefully building and calibrating our immune systems to strike that balance between immune reactions and not going nuts at the things in the world around us. And, perhaps, by avoiding contact with microbes either by living in urban environments or by sanitizing our worlds too much, we are breaking our contact with all of these old friends that we rely upon to tune our immunity, leaving us ill-prepared for dealing with all the challenges of the wider world, for dealing with all the stuff that might then trigger an immune response.

GROSS: What you're talking about, too, here is the theory that when children are born - when babies are born and they pass through the vaginal canal, they get exposed to a whole set of microbes that a baby needs to develop a healthy microbiome and that babies who are delivered through a C-section do not get exposed to the same microbes. Can you talk a little bit about that and what the latest thinking on that is?

YONG: Sure. So the womb is a sterile environment and we - and babies first encounter microbes when they pass through the vaginal canal during birth, and they set the tone for all the other microbes that then colonize the child. If you are born through a C-section, you encounter a different set of microbes that might come from say the skin or the hospital environment. So we see different communities in babies that are born from different roots.

Now, what that means for a child's future health is still very much unclear. We see from studies in adults that people who were born through C-sections or through normal vaginal roots don't actually end up with vastly different communities of microbes on their bodies. So it seems that in the long run, a lot of these differences shake themselves out. But whether those temporary differences can affect our health, whether they change the way our body develops at a very crucial point in our lives is very much an open question. We don't know the answers to that yet.

GROSS: Well, I'm glad that the C-section babies seem to catch up because a lot of women have to have C-sections, and I'd hate to think that they have to feel guilty that their babies aren't going to have healthy microbiomes as a result of that.

YONG: Right. I don't want to demonize anything, and I don't think microbiome science is in this - is in a mature enough state to make people worry or feel guilty about their health choices yet or their life decisions. And it's helpful to think of the body as these sets of grand ecosystems. You know, if you change a jungle or a grassland, you know, it's not going to go wildly off course through simple means.

Often, you need to ding these things multiple times from multiple stresses, say, pollution or fire or whatever before they go - they shift into an irreversible new state. So ecosystems are resilient. They can absorb a lot of change, and the same is true for the microbiome. If you ding it with, say, antibiotics, if you change it through, say, a C-section. It will move. It will change, but often it bounces back. And the big questions are, you know, what sorts of changes do you need in order to really change it? And do those little changes matter in the short term? And I think we don't know.

GROSS: My guest is Ed Yong, author of the new book ""I Contain Multitudes"" about the trillions of microbes that live in and on us. After we take a short break, we'll talk about the microbes in breast milk and how bacteria are being used to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses like Zika and dengue fever. And as the Olympics near the conclusion, Milo Miles has a review of an album from a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Ed Yong, author of the new book ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" It's about the trillions of microbes that live in and on humans and animals and how this ecosystem affects our digestion, immunity and general health. When we left off, we were talking about how this ecosystem is affected by the microbes you're exposed to as an infant. For example, scientists are studying how babies are colonized by bacteria during childbirth as the babies pass through the vaginal canal.

I think scientists are also investigating the difference between breast feeding and bottle feeding when it comes to developing a healthy microbiome in an infant. What are some of the differences between the bacterial makeup or the microbe make - microbial makeup of breast milk - human breast milk - versus cow's milk?

YONG: Well, so human breast milk seems like a very straightforward way of nourishing a baby. But actually about 10 percent of breast milk consists of these sugars, these complex sugars that babies can't digest at all. And they are there to nourish the microbes in the baby's gut. There are specific strains, including one called the...

GROSS: I'm going to stop you here, so part of breast milk is to feed the microbes (laughter).

YONG: That's right, yeah.

GROSS: That's kind of fascinating.

YONG: It's amazing, isn't it? I think this is why I love the science of the microbiome because it takes very familiar things like breast feeding and casts them in a completely different light. So breast milk isn't just a way of nourishing an infant. It's a way of nourishing babies' first microbes. It's really a way of engineering an entire world inside a baby's body. You know, breastfeeding mother is a sculptor of ecosystems.

GROSS: And cow's milk doesn't have that?

YONG: Human milk, for reasons that are still unclear, seems to have a much wider range of these sugars than the milk of any other mammal. There are very specific strains of microbes, including one called B infantis that have evolved to digest these sugars with great efficiency. So in the guts of breastfed infants these microbes tend to dominate.

And they have benefits for the baby, too. They feed the baby's gut cells in return. They help to seal up the lining of the gut, and they reduce inflammation. So they have - they have tremendous benefits. And by nourishing those microbes, mothers are also helping their own kids.

GROSS: I want to get back to talking about the germ-free mice and the use of mice that are living in germ-free bubbles so that scientists can experiment on them, exposing them to certain microbes to see what the response is. One of the things that scientists are studying in this kind of germ-free mouse is obesity and body weight. Would you give us a sense of the kinds of experiments being done relating to body weight with these germ-free mice?

YONG: Sure. So about 10 years ago, in some very classic experiments, scientists took microbes that were from obese and lean individuals and put them in the sterile mice. So the mice that received the obese community's put on more weight than their counterparts who received the lean ones. And that was a seminal finding. It really showed that perhaps these microbes aren't just, you know, going along for the ride. Maybe they're actually grabbing the wheel now and then. Maybe they are seriously influencing our weight, the way we deal with the energy in our food.

The thing is that the links between obesity and the microbiome are actually very complicated. And even though there's been 10 years of research, there are still a lot of things we don't know. So people have found differences in the microbe communities between people who are fat and lean. So you get different species that rise to the fore in different groups. But there aren't consistent differences between studies. So it's still really hard to say what, say, a, quote, unquote, ""obese microbiome"" looks like, let alone how you might want to manipulate it.

And one critical study that was done, again with these germ-free mice, showed that if you take the microbes from a lean individual and put them in a rodent that has put on too much weight, then that rodent will lose weight but only if it also eats a traditionally healthy diet that's full of plants and fiber. And I think that shows that the microbiome might be deeply influenced in our lives, but it doesn't provide any easy solutions to health problems. When the first wave of studies came out about 10 years ago, headlines were full of things like, you know, blame microbes for your weight or maybe we'll be able to take some probiotic that immediately causes us to lose weight. And I think it's nowhere near that simple.

The microbiome is not a panacea for our health problems. It doesn't explain them all in their entirety. I think it just shows how important microbes are in our lives and what a strong influence they have.

GROSS: And this is why someone - and I forget who it is - gives an award that's named the Overselling the Microbiome Award (laughter).

YONG: (Laughter) That's right, yeah. His name is Jonathan Eisen. He's a wonderful microbiologist. He's a true champion, an evangelist for microbes. But he's also very skeptical, and I think with good reason for a lot of the claims that are surrounding the microbiome. This is one of the most fashionable areas, the hottest areas of modern biology. And the microbiome has been linked to all sorts of health problems.

But a lot of those studies are still correlative. We still don't know whether the microbes are leading to the disorders, whether they're a consequence of them, whether it's both or neither. And we are still at this very early stage of understanding our partnerships with the microbes that share our lives. We know they're important. But how important are they? And in what ways, and how might we be able to influence them?

GROSS: So when it comes to microbiome research, it seems like we're still kind of in the infancy of it. We know enough to know this is a really promising field. We might learn a lot about foods to eat and not eat, about things to expose ourselves and not to expose ourselves to. We might find new cures for autoimmune diseases. But right now, it seems like it's still in the formative stages, very experimental.

YONG: Yeah, very much so. We've known about microbes for over 350 years. But the science of the human microbiome has really only taken off in the last decade or so. And there's so much we don't know. We don't still have a full catalog of the species that live inside us. We still don't really understand what makes my microbiome different to yours. What explains those variations between people - much less what a good microbiome looks like or how you might get to that stage.

But I think the potential there is huge because the microbiome is theoretically very flexible. We should be able to change it. We just don't quite know how yet. And maybe one of the quicker wins with microbiome science might be to use the microbiome as a sort of diagnostic tool, of looking at it and say what you're more likely to develop - this disease or that disorder - or to use it to influence our treatment. So we know that microbes within us affect how well medicines work in our body. We know that a lot of different drugs, from the hottest new cancer immunotherapy drugs to obvious things like acetaminophen can work in some people and not in others because of which microbes they carry.

And maybe we might also be able to find ways of influencing the microbiome without needing to add or subtract strains. So there's one group that does a lot of work on heart disease. And we give - if you have a high risk of heart disease, your doctor might prescribe you a statin, which is a drug that's designed to target enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism that are made by your own body. But bacteria can also affect the way you deal with cholesterol, and they could also contribute to the risk of heart disease in that way. And now some - one group of scientists has developed a molecule that can stop these bacteria from leading to rises in cholesterol. So maybe in the future you might get a combination of two drugs from your doctor, a statin to treat the human half of you and another chemical to affect the microbial half.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" Let's take a short break. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and does a science blog for National Geographic called ""Not Exactly Rocket Science."" Not everybody has a favorite microbe, but you do (laughter).

YONG: Yes.

GROSS: Tell us what it is.

YONG: I do. It is called Wolbachia. It was discovered in 1924, and it was found inside a common brown mosquito by two scientists, Hertig and Wolbach. And for decades, no one knew what it did or how common it was, whether it was important. It was largely neglected. And then scientists realized that actually it's incredibly common. It's not found in humans, but it is found in some 4 in 10 species of insects and other arthropods, which are themselves the most numerous and most diverse animals on the planet.

So Wolbachia is extraordinarily successful, and it does all sorts of incredible things. So in some hosts, it is a parasite that has a thing out for males because Wolbachia only passes down from mothers to daughters, and so males are a complete dead end to it. In some - in some species, like woodlice, it converts males into females. In others, it kills males outright so that the females outnumber males by 100 to 1.

And in some wasps, Wolbachia allows them to reproduce by cloning themselves, so they have no need for males whatsoever. But in some cases, this thing is also an ally. It is a mutualist. It allows some caterpillars that eat leaves to stop the leaves from turning yellow. It actually holds back the progress of fall so that these - its hosts can have more to eat. And it has properties that are really important to us humans.

So Wolbachia is found in parasitic worms that cause debilitating tropical diseases like elephantiasis and river blindness. And by finding drugs that can kill Wolbachia, scientists are finally looking for and discovering effective ways of curing and treating these illnesses.

GROSS: But what about mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika? There seems to be some relevance there, too.

YONG: That's right. Wolbachia turns out to be a really powerful way of controlling mosquito-borne diseases. So scientists in Australia have spent about 25 years trying to load this bacterium into Aedes aegypti, the tiger mosquito, the one that spreads dengue and yellow fever and infamously now Zika. And they've been trying to do this because Wolbachia seems to prevent these insects from transmitting the viruses behind these diseases.

And Wolbachia is so good at spreading through a wild population that if you release a small number of these infected mosquitoes, they ought to fly off into the distance and then within months Wolbachia should be everywhere, thus rendering this entire community of insects unable to spread disease. They - the bacterium changes them from vectors into dead ends. And this was tried for the first time in 2011 in several suburbs of Australia. And this team showed indeed that Wolbachia rises to dominance in these natural populations, and they're now trying this approach in big megacities around the world, in places like Brazil and Colombia and Indonesia and Vietnam. And there are so many...

GROSS: Places with mosquito issues.

YONG: Places with mosquito issues, places with severe dengue problems. The approach was initially developed in order to eliminate dengue fever, but it seems to work against Zika, as well against a lot of other mosquito-borne diseases, and it has tremendous advantages. The - unlike, say, insecticides, which are toxic and need to be continuously resprayed, Wolbachia in these mosquitoes seems to have no problems, no safety risks. And it sustains itself. Once you release the insects, they go off on their business and you don't need to keep on replenishing them.

GROSS: So you're not messing with the mosquitoes' genetics. You're introducing a bacteria?

YONG: That's right. There is no genetic modification. These mosquitoes are not GMOs to speak of. They've been simply united with a bacterium that is already present in a large proportion of other insects.

GROSS: So now that you see your body as housing huge communities of microbes, how has that changed your life? Has it changed, like, what you eat or how you behave or what you expose yourself to?

YONG: I'm certainly less fearful of the microbial world than I would have been 20 years ago. You know, I don't - I wash my hands of course, but I don't over-scrub them. I don't use sanitizers. But, you know, really what writing this book has given me is a broader perspective of the world around me. So I always loved the natural world. You know, I was that kid who went to zoos all the time. I would watch wildlife documentaries and read books about nature.

And now I understand that all this biology which I thought I knew, all these creatures, these elephants and hawks and fish that I was fascinated by, these things I could see with my eyes, are actually deeply and profoundly influenced by things that I cannot see. And I know that if I go to a zoo now that every animal and every visitor in that zoo is in fact a zoo in its own right.

GROSS: Give us an example of an animal that you see differently now.

YONG: There are - in the very deep oceans, there are environments called hydrothermal vents, these belching chimneys of superheated water. And there's a worm that lives in these vents called riftia and it's - it can grow a few metres long, and it has these beautiful red gills that look like someone's pushed a tube of lipstick out all the way. And this worm lives in this environment, which just hasn't got any food, but it has microbes in its body.

A lot of its body, probably the majority of it, consists of bacteria. They grab minerals from the vent environment and use these to create nutrients. And that is entirely how the worm sustains itself. This animal has lost its mouth and it's gut because why bother having a digestive system at all when you don't need to eat when you have microbes inside you to provide you with all your energy? And I think that's just a stunning example of how intimate the animals can evolve to rely upon their microbes. This is a creature that would not be able to survive at all without the multitudes inside it.

GROSS: Don't you wonder what the world looks like from the point of view of the microbes that you write about, like, if one of the microbes was writing this book, how different it would be (laughter)?

YONG: I feel like we wouldn't even get a mention.

GROSS: (Laughter).

YONG: We are just this footnote, this icing on the - on this gigantic microbial cake. You know, in the book, I talk about how if you condense the history of the Earth into a single calendar year, so the Earth was created in the first of January and we are now in the 31 of December just before the stroke of midnight, then humans arose about 30 minutes ago. And even all the multicellular creatures, the things we can see, all the animals and plants we're familiar with, only arose a couple of months back whereas bacteria probably first evolved, say, at the start of March. So for the vast majority of life on Earth, everything was microbial.

You know, bacteria have been the rulers of the planet for most of the Earth's history, and they are still the rulers of the planet. They still govern the movements of chemicals all around the world. They are in every possible habitat. They are omnipresent, and they are hugely influential. And in many ways, our bodies, the bodies of every other animals or our cities that we are so proud of, all of these are just more habitats for bacteria and other microbes to inhabit.

GROSS: Ed Yong, thank you so much.

YONG: Thank you very much for having me.

GROSS: Ed Yong's new book about the microbes within us is called ""I Contain Multitudes."" After we take a short break, Milo Miles will review an album by a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble. This is FRESH AIR.

Breath of Earth by Beth Cato Paperback, pages ; cm | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

More than a century later, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake remains a dramatic, traumatic moment in American history. That makes it the perfect vector for an alternate history novel — a potential that isn't lost on Beth Cato. In her latest novel, Breath of Earth, the Nebula-nominated author casts off from the wholly fabricated fantasy world of her acclaimed steampunk duology, The Clockwork Dagger and The Clockwork Crown. Instead, she sets Breath of Earth at the center — indeed, the epicenter — of a magic-infused, reality-warped version of San Francisco circa 1906. In so many ways, it's a city on the brink. And Cato doesn't let you forget that for a second.

Breath of Earth opens on April 15, 1906, three days before the quake took place in our world. Cato's world, though, is strikingly not ours. Following Japan's intervention in the U.S. Civil War, which included military aid in the form of magic, the two countries formed an alliance called the Unified Pacific. Since then, the superpower has consolidated its hold on the globe through its use of geomancy: magic drawn from the energy of the earth itself. By 1906, the Unified Pacific is waging a never-ending war with rival power China, leading to the oppression of Chinese-Americans on the West Coast. Ingrid Carmichael is a 25-year-old secretary to Warden Sakaguchi of the Earth Wardens Cordilleran Auxiliary, a group that uses geomancy for the public good — so long as it aligns with the interests of the Unified Pacific.

When the Auxiliary is mysteriously attacked, the headstrong Ingrid begins owning her considerable geomantic power, which she's had to suppress due to the sexism of the age. And as she struggles through a web of homegrown unrest and geopolitical intrigue, a dashing Southerner named Cy Jennings sparks feelings she's not ready to deal with. Cato already proved her expertise as weaving romance with adventure in her Clockwork books, and in Breath of Earth, she keeps that chemistry breezy; in fact, the book as a whole strikes a nervy balance between easygoing charm and suspense, especially as the four-day-long plot counts down to the fateful quake that threatens to destroy much more than a chunk of San Francisco.

Cato's exhaustive research of the time and place gives the book texture and grit, and she hasn't whitewashed what was a very problematic chapter of America's history.

As brisk as Cato's plot is, it's also straightforwardly simple. But she embroiders it richly with gorgeous period setpieces, imaginative speculation and the charismatic Ingrid herself, a hero-coming-into-her-own full of gumption and dimension. Cato's system of earth-based magic is fun to dig into, so to speak, and she injects plenty of swashbuckling action into her conceptual playground. There's even some good-old-fashioned, goggles-and-airships steampunk barnstorming to sink your teeth into, another welcome holdover from the Clockwork books.

Where Breath of Earth really shines, though, is in its detail and relevance. Cato's exhaustive research of the time and place gives the book texture and grit, and she hasn't whitewashed what was a very problematic chapter of America's history. She spotlights the plight of the Chinese-American population of the West Coast in the early 20th century with sensitivity and attention; at the same time, that tension becomes essential to the story, especially as it boils over into the streets of San Francisco. Historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt weave throughout the story with neat twists. And the book speaks to this century, too. It may take place in an alternate universe over a hundred years ago, but it deals with the issues of xenophobia, racism, sexism and anti-immigrant hatred set against a backdrop of perpetual war, a situation that feels familiar today. Rather than taking a soapbox stand, Breath of Earth makes its points as a witty, charming adventure yarn — one that's only as escapist as you want to be.

There have been a couple times in recent weeks when people we’ve interviewed asked that we remove their names from the stories we posted on the Web. We have issued guidance on this topic several times before. Reminders seem to be in order about how to avoid getting into such situations and how to handle them if they arise.

Click on these headlines to see our guidance:

– ‘This Story About You Is Going To Be On The Web Forever And You May Come To Regret That’

– Reminder: Whether To Go With ‘First-Name-Only’ Needs To Be Discussed And Explained

– How To Explain Why We Won’t ‘Take Down’ A Story

– When We’re Asked To Remove A Photo, Here’s What We Do

Here are some important points from those notes:

– We’re not saying that Sen. Doe or Mayor Smith or CEO Jones need to be reminded that what they say to us is on the record and will be available to anyone with a Web connection. They should know what they’re doing.

– The notes don’t cover “reporting done in war zones or situations when stopping to have a long conversation about the long tail of the Web isn’t safe or practical.”

– But the guidance does cover other situations involving people who are vulnerable. Those include survivors of sexual assault, people with serious medical conditions and those whose lives may be put in danger if they are fully identified. As the handbook says, “we minimize undue harm and take special care with those who are vulnerable or suffering.”

We do not preview our stories for those we interview. But it is essential that vulnerable individuals understand in general how we will be using the information we get from them, how we will identify them and whether any images of them will be published (remember: visuals are important parts of our journalism and we treat them that way). There may be times when people say we can use their full names and photos and we are not comfortable doing so.

It must be made clear to such individuals that our stories do not only air on the radio — they live on various digital forms and will be searchable on the Web.

How such individuals’ names, biographical details and images will be handled must be discussed with a senior editor well before anything is aired or published. That means a supervising senior editor, a deputy managing editor or the standards & practices editor. In reality, they’ll all probably be involved.

One other reminder (because we’re asked about it at least once a week):

“When we decide to withhold a source’s name from a story, we don’t invent a pseudonym for that source.”

When Sadie Dupuis moved to Philly earlier this year, she returned to the creative headspace where Speedy Ortiz originally began: making music in a bedroom. Slugger is Dupuis' debut solo album under the Sad13 moniker, with playful, empowered and intimate pop songs that don't stray far from the weirdly liberating confines of a tiny room.

Featuring sugary synths and 8-bit drum beats, Sad13's first single ""Get A Yes"" doesn't have any of Speedy Ortiz's gnarly guitar work. This is a bedroom-pop song that grew up on the ear-popping production of '90s R&B and Courtney Love's raw sense of melody, but its woozy glitter roll is unmistakably Dupuis. But, in keeping with the band's determination to make safe spaces for its fans, Sad13 really wants to think about how we present something as intimate as consensual sex to her audience.

""How many kids learn about sex from pop music? And how many fun-sounding pop musicians do a heinous job as sex-ed teachers?"" Dupuis asks NPR. ""Like 'Genie In A Bottle,' which characterizes sex as an internal conflict between the mind and the body — rather than something you should only do when the minds and bodies of all parties involved are synchronized? Or 'Blurred Lines,' in which the narrator presumes to know what his partner wants?""

""Get A Yes"" makes consent sexy in how Dupuis normalizes — even renders tantalizing — the moment before (or even thinking about) getting it on, giving mutual desire real weight: ""I say yes to the dress when I put it on / I say yes if I want you to take it off / I say yes for your touch when I need your touch / I say yes if I want to.""

""You can only get to that affirmative yes through a lot of dialoguing, and I think that process should be viewed as fun, sexy and not at all daunting,"" Dupuis continues. ""So I wanted to make a pop song that explores the excitement inherent in getting and giving consent. And that's why I wrote 'Get A Yes.'""

Slugger comes out Nov. 11 on Carpark and iTunes."

Spoiler alert: Harold, a mere child, has left his bedroom. Don't worry. He ""think[s] it over for some time."" What's more, he has gone by way of an oversized purple crayon. Here's the thing you might not remember about Harold if a short human hasn't sat on your lap in a while — he gets into some real scrapes. Sure, there are the unlimited pies, and a trip to the big city, but there's also a dragon, a near drowning and a quick descent off a mountain. And here's the best part: Everything that scares Harold is something he created — that dragon may be terrifying but it's the dragon he hath made. Harold draws the sea that swallows him and the boat that saves him. And when he gets home again — who can be sure that the bedroom he's drawn, with the moon in the window, is the same one he left? It isn't, really — and that's OK. It's still home — even when something's changed — even when you've changed. And of course, the question that still haunts me: Is Harold going to step on the crayon when he wakes up? That purple's going to leave a mark on the carpet. (For ages 3 to 7)

Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is known for his outspoken personality and oversize public image, which he believes help build his brand name.

""Whether it's good press or bad press, it's getting your name out there,"" Washington Post investigative reporter Michael Kranish tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. ""Getting your name on the gossip pages and the front pages and even the sports pages, [is] all in the effort of building the name.""

Kranish and his Post colleague Marc Fisher are the authors of Trump Revealed, a biography about Trump's life and career that is based on the work of more than 20 of the Post's reporters, editors and fact-checkers.

Fisher says 20 hours of interviews with Trump helped him come to a better understanding of the candidate. ""The man we've come to know and understand is someone who has led a strikingly solitary life given how public he is and how glad-handing his image is,"" Fisher said. ""When I asked him about friendships, he said he really doesn't have friendships of the kind that most people would describe.""

Interview Highlights

On what Trump was like as a kid

Marc Fisher: He was, by both his friends' description and his own, a rambunctious kid who got in trouble a lot and who was a bit of a ruffian. From the youngest age, about age 6 or 7, he pelted the neighbor's toddler with rocks from across the yard. He pulled the pigtails of a classmate. He got into a physical altercation with one of his teachers, and so he was someone who was kind of a rambunctious kid, even obnoxious by some accounts, and he says that he hasn't changed since second grade. So that kind of in-your-face provocateur character that we've come to see in the campaign is something that traces back very cleanly and consistently to this childhood as kind of a tough kid.

On how a lawsuit that charged his father's real estate company with racial bias influenced Trump's business philosophy

Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

Michael Kranish: This was a very serious lawsuit, one of the most significant racial bias cases at the time, and it's very interesting. We were able to obtain, under Freedom of Information Act requests, all of the transcripts for this court case. What happened was, Donald had to decide, was he going to settle this case or was he going to fight the federal government? One night in Manhattan he walked into a nightclub that he belonged to, and there was a man named Roy Cohn, and Roy Cohn of course is the famous or infamous lawyer who was the aide to Joseph McCarthy of the Army-McCarthy hearings that was held in the 1950s. Donald got to talking to Roy Cohn and told him about this racial bias case brought by the federal government, and Cohn, who himself had fought the federal government many times in his career, said: ""Don't settle. Fight like hell. When they hit you, hit back 10 times harder.""

The bottom line is, after this discussion at the nightclub, Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

On Trump using a pseudonym to be his own press agent

Fisher: So what happened is in an effort to kind of spread his image around the city and around the country eventually, Donald Trump would act as his own press agent. He would call reporters as ""John Miller"" or ""John Barron,"" he wouldn't bother even to disguise his voice, but he would call them up and say, ""Donald Trump is going to be out at this club with this amazing celebrity or this model,"" or ""Donald Trump is going to be groundbreaking for a new building."" And he would kind of gin up press coverage as this alter ego, and he would also call reporters to complain about their stories or to encourage them to think about Donald Trump in a better light. ...

Some of the reporters who got these calls knew that it was Trump, and they thought this was kind of weird, but they went along with it; others didn't know. We were lucky enough to get a recording that someone sent me of one of these calls in which he presents himself as John Miller to a reporter for People magazine and if you listen to the recording, it sounds astonishingly like Donald Trump because it is Donald Trump. He carries this on as if no one knows what his very distinctive voice sounds like, and he talks about Donald Trump in this very extremely complimentary way and about what a ladies' man he is, and how women can't stop themselves from coming to him and seeking to go out with him, and this is something that he did for many, many years.

On Trump's debt in the 1990s

Kranish: [The banks] really felt that if they basically forced Donald Trump to repay his debts that they were going to lose everything themselves. Donald Trump had such extraordinary leverage that there came a day when the bankers were concerned that Donald Trump did not have insurance on his yacht, which he bought for some $20 million. Trump's associates basically told the bank, ""Look, you need to pay for the insurance on the yacht, because if something happens to it, you'll have nothing."" He eventually got the bank to pay insurance that Donald Trump himself didn't have. Similarly, Donald Trump had five helicopters the banks wanted to take back. For a time, he actually hid those five helicopters, because he was concerned they'd be swept up by the banks. Eventually they were turned over, but it just shows you the difficult times that Donald Trump was having at that time.

On Trump's business model of selling his name and his image

Fisher: Over time, what Donald Trump learned was that he could do all these things for himself. So the big question is, is he capable of doing this for anyone other than himself? And the track record really makes me kind of skeptical about that, because what we have is someone who, throughout his career, has found ways to enrich himself at the expense of others.

What Donald Trump learned from that experience in New York and Atlantic City was that he could build his entire business model around this idea of selling his image and his name. The more he got people to believe that his image was worth millions, the more he would be able to go out and sell just his name. So many of his latter day projects over the last couple of decades, in fact most of them, do not involve Donald Trump building anything, do not involve Donald Trump creating jobs, they involve Donald Trump going to a developer and saying, ""I will sell you my name that you can put on your building that you have invested in, with your money, and that you will give me a steady, guaranteed income flow."" That's the arrangement he had on many if not most of his building projects in the United States and around the world that have been done in the last 10, 20 years, and similarly with all the other businesses that he's gotten into, whether it's selling medicines or selling a university that he created. All of these things are cases where his involvement on a day-to-day basis is marginal or even nonexistent — what he's sold is the name, and he gets a set multimillion-dollar fee every year that's guaranteed, even if the project fails."

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes — writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians — like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet — so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason — don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet — and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time — but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator — and occasional NPR contributor — K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second — the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine — and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine."

When the financial crisis hit in 2008, Imbolo Mbue lost her job. ""I was very disillusioned about America ..."" she tells NPR's Rachel Martin. ""I was unemployed for over a year and a half.""

Originally from Limbe, Cameroon, Mbue came to U.S. to go to college. After losing her job, she had to start over from scratch — and that led to her sitting down to write her debut novel Behold the Dreamers. One day, while walking down the street, ""I got an inspiration to write this story,"" she says.

Her protagonists, Jende and Neni, are two Cameroonian immigrants trying to make it in New York. But the recession threatens their livelihood and strains their marriage.

""For me, personally, the financial crisis laid bare a lot about the way in which the American dream is not that accessible to everybody ..."" Mbue says. The novel gave her a way to explore and express how the financial crisis affected her perspective on America.

On Limbe, Cameroon, the hometown she shares with her characters

It's a beautiful seaside town ... in the south of Cameroon ... about 80,000 people. Back when I was growing up it wasn't a very fancy town – we didn't have a public library, we didn't have nice hotels, we probably had like one or two hotels. But now it's fairly developed.

We have lots of nice hotels and nightclubs and a lot of tourists come to Cameroon to see Limbe because it has really beautiful black sand beaches. But it's still a place where it's very difficult to change your circumstances if you are born poor.

On how she came to the U.S.

I had relatives who were very generous to sponsor me to come to America to have an education. So I came here to go to college — I went to Rutgers in New Jersey. And then after [college] I moved to New York City and I went to Columbia for my masters.

On expectations of America

What I'd seen about America on TV was, you know, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and The Cosby Show and everything was so glamorous. And I didn't really see much of the difficulty and challenges of being in American — the poverty, the racism — I didn't see much of that.

I think it was the same for Jende and Neni — they had this idea of America being this really, really wonderful place — and it is a wonderful place, it's a beautiful country — but there are challenges to being an immigrant here. ...

[They] are struggling to get by as immigrants ... even if there are opportunities, it's still a challenge to move out of poverty. I've seen that in my life, too.

On the definition of success

They both believe in the American dream. So they had similar ideas, but like in any marriage, at some point people start changing and they start having different ideas of what America means to them. ...

I think for Jende and Neni it was very much about the price they had to pay for this dream. ... They both had to consider: This is the price I have to pay to have the life I want in America and is this price worth it?"

“Othering,” or “otherizing,” has been a topic of conversations on the campaign trail this year and in newsrooms for many years.

I think of it this way: Othering is when a story feels like it’s about “them” and that “they” aren’t like “us.” They’re “others.” It can look and sound as if the news outlet or reporter is tone deaf or condescending. The stories often feel like the reporters began with preconceived notions and looked for confirmation.

This post isn’t about a case of othering. Read or listen to Debbie Elliott’s piece this week about “transgender rights, the new front in culture wars.” The central character is LBGTQ advocate Lane Galbraith. I didn’t detect any othering, so I asked Debbie about the way she reports.

“You know, my approach is always to just try to get to know the people I’m interviewing as people first, not ‘subjects,’ ” she said in an email. “I get rather familiar quickly, but always say something like, ‘OK, now I’m going to get a little nosy or into private territory, please don’t be offended and feel free to wave me off if it’s too personal.’ I will also be honest and admit that I’m not sure a question is appropriate, but ‘here’s what I’d like to know.’ “Generally, I find that people are longing to tell their story, so I mostly listen. And in this case, we had spoken a few times before during the same sex marriage battles in Alabama, so I had a bit of a foundation to build from. … “There are some interviews you do that are mostly about gathering facts, or (let’s be honest here) getting the sound bite you need. But if you’re looking to share a deeper truth, and get below the surface of the news of the day, it requires a different approach. You have to care about a person’s story and give them the time and space to tell it. And that’s hardly ever linear or even logical. Those kind of interviews are certainly less efficient, but can yield priceless insights.”

There’s a key point there: “I mostly listen.” Also, yes, we tell stories. But they’re not about us or our preconceived notions. As Debbie says, “people are longing to tell their story … give them the time and space to tell it.”

No news outlet gets this right every time. We should keep talking about othering and how to avoid it. Please flag “good” and “bad” examples.

I write novels for a living, and novels are about how characters deal with the intrinsic conflicts that make them who they are — and their efforts to overcome them. Sometimes characters are able to overcome their conflicts and sometimes, in tragedies, they succumb to them, which results in ruin. This is why it troubled me so much to witness recent events unfold like something out of a book.

Part of the heartbreak of watching the nightmare up the highway from me in Dallas was seeing, like a story's dramatic conclusion, several of America's greatest inherent conflicts coming together in one moment: fatally disastrous policing; our unresolved racial legacy dating back to the original sin of slavery and the century of socio-economic disenfranchisement that followed it; our love of guns and our reoccurring shame of the mass murders made possible by them.

I watched that night in Dallas, like everyone else, through the lens of my own backstory: When I saw Philando Castile in Minnesota lying shot in his car, I thought of the time I was pulled over for ""speeding"" while stopped at a traffic light in East Houston, or when I was pulled over for making a right-on-red in Giuliani's New York. That time, the cop and I both knew that the light had been green; the stop was just an excuse to run my info through the system because he didn't like the way I looked.

When I saw Philando Castile in Minnesota lying shot in his car, I thought of the time I was pulled over for ""speeding"" while stopped at a traffic light in East Houston.

I thought of what might have happened in those moments if I wasn't privileged enough to pop into my most professorial voice, flash a faculty ID and access all the adjacent off-white privilege my mixed heritage could provide.

I watched Dallas, as officers in a police force commended for their de-escalation efforts were murdered in the streets, and thought about teaching at my public university in Texas, where students this fall will now be able to legally walk through campus strapped with AR-15s on their way to pick up their grades.

And I know others watched the events in Dallas, and watched the unraveling in Baton Rouge, with their own personalized scenes in their head, their own back stories, their own choice of media-catered facts, their own inherited prejudices, and came to completely different truths about what is going on in the world right now.

When I was growing up, my mother taught me two central things about dealing with the cops while black, the same principles many black parents taught: First, that if you just stay out of trouble and docilely comply with whatever the cops want, you'll be OK; and second, that if the rest of the world saw what was really happening in deadly interactions between black people and the police, they'd see the problem.

At this moment, those ideas seem like wishful self-delusions. I don't know what to tell my kids.

A short while before his life was stolen, slain Baton Rouge Police Officer Montrell Jackson posted a Facebook message that was eerily prescient of the national moment that would soon claim his life. He wrote, ""In uniform, I get nasty hateful looks, and out of uniform some consider me a threat."" His ultimate conclusion — ""These are trying times. Please don't let hate infect your heart"" — showed the type of insight that made him exactly the type of officer we need out there. Now he is lost to us.

Right now, in the streets, online and on TV, we as Americans are fighting over control of the national narrative: Are these acts of violence the fault of the protesters, the police or a larger criminal-justice system that's failing everyone?

I understand why those who feel they aren't directly affected by this issue would be tempted to react to the complexity of what's going on by scapegoating or dismissing recent events as isolated incidents. We all have full, demanding lives. No one wants to add to the burden of dramatically changing how our society is functioning to their daily duties.

But I don't have that privilege. What I have is black children. Every time a black person ends up dead after a police interaction, I read the details. I study them. I look for something they did, something they didn't do, something that I can tell my kids to avoid so that if they're ever pulled aside for a minor infraction by the wrong cop, they can come out alive.

But for every single piece of advice I can give them, there is a hashtagged name of someone who did the exact same thing — and died. I'm petrified for my children. I'm petrified for my friends' children. I'm worried about the good cops out there whose jobs are getting more dangerous because of the injustices perpetrated by others. I'm scared for our country. I fear that if we don't resolve our intrinsic conflicts — our inherent national flaws — that our story will end in ruin."

Night of the Animals by Bill Broun Hardcover, 543 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

It took Bill Broun 14 years to write Night of the Animals. But the novel, Broun's debut, has still proved remarkably timely in a summer of ""Brexit""-tinged anxieties.

The book depicts a dark future in which the European Union has dissolved and the U.K. has become a pacified surveillance state. Between ""indigents"" and ""the new aristocracy,"" a vanishing middle class bows beneath abundant chocolate, lager, legal hallucinogens and mind-numbing electronics.

In the middle of it all, the London Zoo stands as a kind of ark for all the non-human species who are being driven out of existence. And Cuthbert, the character at the heart of the narrative, can hear them clamoring to get out.

""He actually hears the animals asking to be released,"" Broun, a professor at East Stroudsburg State University, tells NPR's Scott Simon. ""And he understands that releasing them is actually something that is bigger than simply releasing animals from the zoo. It's a kind of fulcrum between the old world and a kind of liberating cataclysm.""

Interview Highlights

On the world he has created: London in 2052

There is a newly empowered monarchy, and a lot of the important Victorian reforms that put that monarchy into check have been reversed, so that there's a fictionalized King Henry, who's a fictionalized version of the current Prince Harry, turned into a tyrant. Britain has become ultra-nationalistic and powerful, too.

On the inspirations for his main character, Cuthbert

I lived in the 1990s in Houston, Texas, and for complicated reasons I ended up making friends with a lot of men who were schizophrenic, who had sometimes been on the streets, who sometimes were in kind of shaky housing situations.

And I had my own struggles with psychosis occasionally and anxiety disorder. Indeed, I turned to alcohol as a way of coping. One of the things that I had found with these men is that they had all done the same thing. They were essentially self-medicating, and when they weren't taking their medication, they would kind of go off the rails. But I was fascinated by their imaginations and their creativity.

I really felt that I was searching for God as I was writing this book.

One of these people is a man I grew very close to, and I'm still friends with him today. I actually took him to the zoo, and I saw him talking to the howler monkeys in this just incredibly tender-hearted voice. Then I started thinking about all the different ways people have talked to animals and heard them talk back — in everything from Christian hagiography to children's stories. So I just really became fascinated by the idea of bringing to life a man who could speak to animals and hear them, too.

On the kinds of traps we confront — but real and metaphorical

I'm trying to make a comment on different kinds of entrapment. I thought about the different ways that people are trapped — you know, trapped in a kind of grief.

For Cuthbert, you know, he had lost his brother at a young age, and he mourns for this brother. And he believes — this is the other thing — he believes that by releasing these animals, there's a possibility of finding his brother, who is presented as lost and possibly dead. And that grief that he has, that need to find his brother, I think that's one of the big motivating factors for him.

On what it was like to live with the themes, the characters, this world for the 14 years he spent writing the novel

For me, I know if might sound hokey, but it was kind of a spiritual journey for me. I really felt that I was searching for God as I was writing this book. And Cuthbert in the novel, his savior in some ways is a stranger who happens to be a woman who's a police officer. I believe that God works through people — and animals, too."

Updated at 6 p.m. with judge's ruling

Usually when there's a question about who created a piece of art, the artist is dead and can't speak for himself — he can't say, ""Hey, I made that,"" or ""Nope, not mine."" But this is a story about a living artist who went to court to prove that a painting in fact is not his. And on Tuesday, a judge in Chicago agreed.

The painting in question is a desert landscape. There's blue sky at the top, red rocks and green cacti. It's owned by Robert Fletcher, a 62-year-old former corrections officer living in the Canadian city of Sault Ste. Marie. Here's how Fletcher says he got the painting: In 1976, he was working in Ontario's Thunder Bay Correctional Centre when he hit it off with an inmate named Peter Doige, who was in for LSD possession. Doige was going through some rough times, but he had this painting he had made in art class.

""I said, 'That painting you did inside, that desert scene, I absolutely love it,' "" Fletcher remembers. ""He said, 'Would you give me $100 for it?' "" Fletcher said yes.

A couple of decades later, a buddy of Fletcher's is over at his house and sees the painting. He tells Fletcher that it's by a famous artist — Peter Doig. They look him up online and Fletcher recognizes him. ""We watched some videos online of him being interviewed and the first thing I remember noticing is his body language — you know, some facial expressions and his use of his hands,"" Fletcher says.

Peter Doig is a pretty famous artist — last year, one of his paintings sold at auction for nearly $26 million. So Fletcher tried to sell his painting. That's when representatives for Doig came back and said the painting wasn't a Doig. Not only that, but Peter Doig doesn't know Robert Fletcher. And while he did do LSD in the '70s, Doig's representatives say he was never in jail.

For most people, that would be the end of it, but Fletcher and the owner of the gallery he hired to sell the painting were so convinced it was a Doig that they lawyered up and went to court.

Sergio Muñoz Sarmiento has worked in art law for over a decade. He says, ""It's odd in the sense that this is the first time that I'm aware of that an artist is being asked to testify that a work of art was not made by him. ... Even if you're alive, how do we say this is a work by you and this is not a work by you?""

Here's another complication: The signature on the painting in question spells the artist's last name Doige, with an e, but the famous artist spells his name with no e. And there was a Peter Doige in the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre in the 1970s. According to his sister, he was fond of art and music and liked to paint. Doige died in 2012.

After Tuesday's ruling, Doig's lawyer, Matthew Dontzin, released a statement that said, ""I have rarely seen such a flagrant example of unethical conduct in the U.S. courts nor a case that inflicted such needless burdens on a defendant. Artists should be grateful to Peter for having the ethical and financial fortitude to fight tirelessly to ensure that justice prevailed in today's verdict."""

Growing up in South Carolina, soul singer Sharon Jones knew from the first time she sang in her church's Christmas play that she would be a musician.

""I was, like, maybe 8, 9 years old ... and I got to sing 'Silent Night,'"" she tells Fresh Air host Terry Gross. Jones remembers audience members taking note of her performance. ""Right then and there,"" she says, ""I knew that I was going to be a singer. God had blessed me with a gift.""

Now the lead singer for the soul group, The Dap-Kings, Jones is inspired by the classic soul and R&B she grew up with. The band, which recorded its first album in 2001, is known for its energetic showmanship and '60s-style soul revue shows.

In 2013, Jones was forced to take a hiatus from performing after she was diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer. A new documentary, Miss Sharon Jones!, by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple, follows Jones in the first seven months following her diagnosis.

Jones says that while extensive surgery and chemotherapy took a lot out of her, her desire to make music never faltered. After finishing chemo, recovering from the surgery and getting clean scans, she returned to the stage with The Dap-Kings in 2014.

The cancer has since returned, but Jones wants to continue making music. ""This cancer is here, and I have to take the chemo,"" she says, ""but I want to perform. I just want to be able to get onstage and move.""

Interview Highlights

On not listening to music while she was sick

I didn't. I didn't. Because I couldn't sing. I couldn't get air because, people didn't realize, I was cut across the diaphragm, all the way up from right under the center under my breasts, all the way down to the top of my navel, almost. They had to cut through the diaphragm, through the stomach, remove stuff. They removed like 10 pounds of things ... 10 pounds that I never gained back.

On when she realized that she would eventually get back onstage

I had a February date, and my goal was to be back at that date. And everything in the filming, there's a scene with the church scene, that was my first time even attempting to sing after months. And that's when I knew, from the church scene, that I was ready. I was going to be ready for February. I knew I was going to have the strength. I knew that sickness wasn't unto to death.

I thought I was going to die maybe a couple of hours after the doctor hit me with everything. You know, you go through that. So for a couple of hours I was on my deathbed. But other than that, I overcame that. Doing the film was also my therapy, and I knew that it would help someone out there with cancer, or going through it, as long as I inspired someone. That's where my health came from, my energy came from, knowing my fans was out there and I'm getting back to them, and I wanted them to see what I'm going through.

On getting back onstage the first time after her treatment for pancreatic cancer



The night I went out there, it was a different Sharon, because the hair is gone. That energy, I mean, everyone said my energy was great, but I didn't feel it at all. Even now, the days on the stage I'm just not myself, I don't have that energy. The legs doesn't lift up like I want to with the pain, the neuropathy from certain chemo. It's a hinder, but I do the shows, but it's not the same.

On how she and Dap-Kings songwriter Gabriel Roth create songs together

I just take the music and hear his idea and then I go with it from there. You know, basically he gives me what he thinks, but I have to do it my way, because I'm the soul singer. They're not soul singers, so you can't teach me how to sing soul. You can tell me where to go, just allow me to be myself. That's what we have there with these guys.

A couple of times they got in they thought they had to try to give me some tracks and stuff, and I nipped that in the bud right away. Listening to somebody else singing, I'm trying to go where they goin' and that's not where I would go. I would go nowhere, sing that song. You could get five singers in here and each one of us is going to sing that song differently. Just let me be me. That's how we've gotten where we are today, at Daptone [Records], by them letting me sing the way I feel it."

Here’s a DACS line as it appears in Newsflex:

“A village of Portsoy is reviving an old seamen’s superstition by banning bananas during it’s annual boat festival. NPR’s Lynn Neary talks to festival chairman Roger Goodyear.”

Here’s the introduction to that piece, as posted on one of our transcripts pages:

“A village of Portsoy is reviving an old seamen’s superstition by banning bananas during it’s annual boat festival. NPR’s Lynn Neary talks to festival chairman Roger Goodyear.”

The DACS line was picked up and posted verbatim, including the typos.

We’ve noted before that the information in “DACS lines, scripts and Web teasers could end up as copy on our website and as language read on the air by us or a member station.”

Yes, the transcript editor should spot obvious problems and either fix or write around them. Yes, an “it’s” when it should be “its” and a confusing phrase such as “a village of Portsoy” are not the biggest mistakes we will make.

And, yes, DACS lines have to do a lot (remember to include warnings about offensive language!).

But they should be as clean and accurate as possible from the start. Remember, “your keyboard is a live mic.”

Renee Montagne talks to Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma, one of the states granted an injunction which keeps guidance from the administration on transgender students from going into effect.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

One of the most contentious issues facing this new school year is which bathrooms and locker rooms transgender students will be allowed to use. The Obama administration has issued what it calls guidance that students be allowed to use facilities consistent with their gender identity.

The administration warned that schools refusing to do that could risk their federal school funding. Now a Texas federal judge has temporarily blocked that policy in a case brought by 13 states. We're joined by Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma, one of the states that requested the injunction. Good morning.

SCOTT PRUITT: Good morning, Renee.

MONTAGNE: Why did Oklahoma join this suit?

PRUITT: Well, like many states across the country, we have Title IX funds that were at issue. We have funds that were used in the common school context, K through 12, as well as higher education.

And this guidance letter, as termed by the federal government - if there was no compliance by Oklahoma, those Title IX funds were at risk. And in Oklahoma, that's about 10 to 12 percent of our education funding. There was a substantial amount of revenue that was at issue in this case and put at risk that - for the state of Oklahoma.

MONTAGNE: And of course, Title IX, as many people know, is focused on access to education - best-known for sports promoting equality between the sexes.

PRUITT: It's actually tied to the Title VII, as well, the definitions of immutable characteristics. These were 1972 amendments that were offered by the U.S. Congress and signed by the president at that time.

And as you indicated, the federal government here took a term, sex, as defined in Title IX and Title VII and said that it was going to be reimagined, if you will - redefined to not be biological and anatomical but, rather, an internal sense of identity, which, frankly, could change day to day or week to week.

And I'm glad that you said, Renee, that it's more than bathrooms. There's been so much focus on the bathroom aspect of this significant guidance. It's more than that. It's locker rooms. It's participation in sporting events. It's housing on college campuses.

This is a significant, far-reaching decision that was made by the Justice Department and Department of Education. And I'm glad the court stepped in in Texas to assist the states with clarity.

MONTAGNE: Well, let me say the judge did rule on - with what your argument is - that the term sex in federal anti-discrimination law refers only to the difference between men and women - the sex as defined at birth.

Just briefly, the ruling does not say that school districts cannot follow that guidance. It just says they're not required to. Individual states should decide. What about Oklahoma? What do you think it would do? Do some districts plan to follow these guidelines?

PRUITT: Well, I think that - look, there are two things that the decision did in Texas. One, it said that the states and the federal government, particularly here, should've gone through rulemaking - that this is substantive in nature, that this wasn't guidance in the term of providing guidance to an existing rule.

This was a substantive change. And as such, the agencies at the federal level should've gone through notice and comment. And then secondly, the administration has said - and the Justice Department has said - that they were simply trying to provide clarity to the states across the country.

And the court disregarded that entirely and said, no, this causes confusion. And so to your question, I think that school districts across the country now have latitude and flexibility to make the decision - what's best for them at the local level.

And they're not confused about what's expected of them from the federal government but, rather, have clarity now that they don't have to follow the guidance because of the unlawfulness of the administration.

MONTAGNE: Well, thank you very much. That's Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma. Thanks for joining us.

PRUITT: Thank you, Renee.

A lot of what we read and watch comes to us through recommendation algorithms. Amazon tells us: People who bought this book also bought this other book, and Netflix says: Because you watched this movie, we think you should watch this other movie. And we welcome our new recommendation robot overlords!

But this summer, we're going old school — because we haven't found an algorithm that says: If you loved this movie, you'll devour this graphic novel. (Or like this podcast, enjoy this short story ... you get the idea.)

Welcome to the second installment of Read, Watch, Binge! our summer recommendation series. As you may recall from last month's list, we were tired of algorithms that only matched books to books or movies to movies.

After Rory Staunton fell at the gym and cut his arm in March of 2012, the 12-year-old became feverish. He vomited during the night and complained of a sharp pain in his leg. When his parents called his pediatrician the next day, she said there was a stomach virus going around New York City, and his leg pain was likely due to his fall.

But she did advise his parents, Orlaith and Ciaran Staunton, to take Rory to the emergency department because of possible dehydration. The hospital workers did some blood work, gave him fluids and sent him home.

The next day, Rory's pain and fever were worse. His skin was mottled and the tip of his nose had turned blue. The Stauntons raced back to the hospital, where he was admitted to intensive care. The diagnosis: septic shock. Rory was fighting an infection that was turning his skin black and shutting down his organs.

On Sunday, four days after he dove for the ball in gym class, Rory died.

Sepsis, which is a body's overwhelming response to infection, kills more than 250,000 people in the U.S. every year. People at highest risk are those with weakened immune systems, the very young and elderly, and patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer or kidney disease. It is also risky for people with pneumonia or those who use catheters that can cause infections. But it can strike anyone, even a healthy child like Rory.

Sepsis typically occurs when germs from an infection get into the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. To fight the infection, the body mounts an immune response that may trigger inflammation that damages tissues and interferes with blood flow. That can lead to a drop in blood pressure, potentially causing organ failure and death.

""It was frightening to think that something could kill my son so fast and it would be something that I had never heard of,"" said Orlaith Staunton.

She's not alone. Many people don't know about sepsis. Health care providers struggle to identify it early, but there's no simple diagnostic test. Many symptoms — elevated heart and respiratory rates, fever or chills, pain — are common ones that are present in many conditions.

A growing number of doctors, hospitals, patient advocates and policymakers are pushing to educate consumers and clinicians about sepsis. The goal is to ensure that procedures that focus on prevention and early detection are followed.

The Stauntons established a foundation to raise awareness about the deadly infection, and in 2013 New York became the first state to require all hospitals to implement procedures for early recognition and treatment. This month, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a law requiring similar actions by hospitals in that state.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study Tuesday about sepsis as part of an effort to draw attention to the importance of prevention and early detection.

""Early treatment is vital,"" says Dr. Anthony Fiore, chief of the epidemiology research and innovations branch at the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. ""It's an emergency that you need to deal with, like heart attack and stroke.""

When sepsis advances to septic shock, characterized by severely low blood pressure, each hour of delay in administering antibiotics decreases the odds of survival by an average 7.6 percent, one study found.

In 2013, sepsis (sometimes called septicemia) accounted for nearly $24 billion in hospital costs, the most expensive condition treated. Up to half of people who get it die. Many cases are related to health care, such as catheter use or an infection acquired in the hospital. But contrary to the common perception, approximately 80 percent of cases develop outside the hospital or at a nursing home, according to the CDC.

As the front line in identifying these cases, emergency departments typically have sepsis protocols in place to screen for it.

""The work you do in those first three to six hours in the emergency department makes more difference in cost than the whole next several weeks in the ICU,"" said Dr. Todd L. Slesinger, who co-chairs a task force on sepsis at the American College of Emergency Physicians, which has developed a tool to help emergency department staff screen and treat the condition.

Last fall, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services started requiring hospitals to measure and report on screening and treatment efforts. In addition, Medicare sets penalties for a variety of hospital-acquired conditions, including high rates of post-operative sepsis.

Patient advocates and policymakers agree that patients themselves are key to improving prevention and early detection. Good hygiene can help prevent sepsis, including cleaning wounds. If someone gets injured, look for signs of sepsis, including rapid breathing or heart rate, confusion, fever or chills and pale or discolored skin.

Don't assume health care providers have it covered, experts advise. If you or someone you're caring for has these symptoms, ask the health care provider directly: ""Do you think it might be sepsis?""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Adriane Ohanesian/AP Adriane Ohanesian/AP

It was a tragic turning point.

On July 11, South Sudanese soldiers invaded a hotel in the capital city of Juba and gang-raped foreign aid workers.

""The soldiers just came to the bathroom where all the girls were hiding and they just picked us out of the bathroom one by one,"" says one of the women who was in the hotel. She asked that her name not be used.

Despite calls for help to the U.N. compound a mile down the road, no one came.

Even in a country where violence is commonplace, where a simmering civil war has been reignited, where the humanitarian needs are among the most pressing in the world, this attack sent shock waves through the aid community.

""Certainly something changed and things happened that we were not used to seeing happen,"" says Steve McCann, a security and risk assessment specialist. And now the repercussions are apparent: Some relief agencies have evacuated staff, and others have scaled back their operations.

The incident happened amid a whirlwind of fighting that erupted in Juba last month between government troops loyal to president Salva Kiir and soldiers aligned with former vice president Reik Machar. Machar and his soldiers had recently come back from exile as part of a peace process to end a conflict that began in 2013.

But Machar's return quickly sparked open combat between armies split predominantly along ethnic lines.

When the fighting began on July 8 in the dusty dirt streets of Juba, foreign aid workers hunkered down in their compounds. The violence raged for 4 days and left more than 300 people dead, including refugees inside a United Nation compound and 2 Chinese peacekeepers. Thousands of people fled their homes.

On the southwestern edge of the capital, more than two dozen aid workers took shelter inside the grounds of the Terrain Hotel. The hotel, less than a mile from a large United Nation peacekeeping base, is popular with foreigners. During the fighting most of the foreign aid workers who sought shelter there were from the United States, Australia and the Philippines.

""There were intermittent highs and lows in the fighting,"" says the American woman who spoke to NPR. ""There was a lot of military activity on the road outside of our compound. We were told [by our head office] that they were trying to evacuate us but there were too many checkpoints along the road. That it wasn't safe and that we just need to just sit there and wait.""

On the fourth day of the fighting dozens of South Sudanese troops broke through the gate into the hotel grounds.

A group of about 30 foreign aid workers and a South Sudanese editor who was working for a USAID funded project barricaded themselves in the second story of a block of apartments at the hotel. The block had been built as a ""safe house"" with metal gates on the balconies and steel reinforced doors.

For several hours the soldiers pillaged the hotel, ripping out appliances, ransacking rooms and even carting off the generator. The holed-up humanitarians frantically called the U.N., the U.S. embassy and private security firms to send help.

But help did not arrive. At a U.N. base just up the road, armed peacekeepers with armored vehicles couldn't get authorization to leave their base and go to the hotel. The U.S. Embassy didn't have the resources to dispatch a rescue team. Private security companies also said the streets were too dangerous to reach the Terrain Hotel.

""The soldiers were trying to break down the door and then they started shooting through the door,"" says the American woman. One bullet hit a Vermont-based contractor in the leg.

Finally the door gave way.

Once they got in, the predominantly Dinka government soldiers shot and killed a South Sudanese journalist, John Gatluak. Gatluak, who's from the Nuer ethnic group, was working for Internews, a USAID-funded project to teach media skills to local journalists.

Then the soldiers grabbed the women who were hiding in the bathroom.

""The soldier that picked me, he walked me in to another room,"" says the American. ""The room that he walked me in to there was blood on the floor and there were panties on the floor. So I knew what he was going to do.""

She collapsed on the floor in a fetal position, clutching her knees to her chest and refusing to move.

""He kept hitting me with an AK-47, yelling at me to open my legs,"" the American woman says. She says the soldier kept screaming at her, ""'Open your legs. I'm going to kill you if you don't open your legs.'""

Eventually, she says, another soldier who appeared to be a commander ordered the soldier to stop. She says she was not raped. But at least 5 women were. One told the Associated Press that 15 men assaulted her for hours.

Hours after the attack on the Terrain Hotel began, most of the aid workers were finally taken out of the hotel by security forces aligned with the same government troops that had attacked them. Three of the Western women weren't rescued until the next morning.

Steve McCann, the security specialist, says South Sudan has been a dangerous place for years. His company, Safer Edge, trains international relief groups in conflict zones around the world.

In the past McCann didn't expect that foreign aid workers in South Sudan would be directly and personally attacked.

""No,"" he says. ""We didn't feel that international staff were the targets. No.""

There are places in the world where international aid workers simply can't operate — parts of Syria, Libya, Yemen and Somalia for instance. Before the Terrain Hotel attack, South Sudan wasn't one of those no-go zones. And McCann cautions that this incident won't cause all aid agencies to pull their foreigners out of the country. But the growing insecurity will force groups to reassess their operations and be far more cautious in South Sudan.

Julien Schopp with Interaction, an umbrella group for development and relief agencies based in Washington, says this incident was the culmination of 2 years of growing insecurity for aid workers in South Sudan.

""If you look at the latest aid worker security report, for the first time South Sudan is the most insecure location in the world overtaking Afghanistan and Somalia, where we expect more violence,"" Schopp says.

The insecurity for aid agencies in South Sudan comes at the same time the need for international relief is growing rapidly. There's a cholera outbreak, malaria is on the rise, two and a half million people have been driven from their homes and millions more are dependent on international food rations. During the eruption of violence in July, even those food rations weren't safe. An entire warehouse for the U.N. World Food Program in Juba was ransacked."

Chris Wink and Phil Stanton, two creators of The Blue Man Group who famously say nothing, answer questions about people who have a lot to say. Originally broadcast June 11, 2016.

KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. If your gas tank's empty, it's time to Bill 'er up. I'm Bill Kurtis.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTIS: And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: All right.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: It's August. It's August, and most years that has us saying where did the time go? But it's 2016 - it's more like, oh, my God, there are still five months left.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTIS: There's only one thing to do - kill as much time as possible. And what better way to do that than with some of our favorite interviews from recent shows? We'll start off, fittingly, with some loud surrealism - not the presidential election, but the Blue Man Group.

SAGAL: We spoke to Blue Man Group founders Chris Wink and Phil Stanton on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of this long-running show back in June. And I started by asking them to describe it.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

CHRIS WINK: Well, you know, there's a lot of percussion and technology and pop cultural references. I think the best way to describe it is a multimedia kind of potpourri of things, doesn't really stay in one vibe for too long. But it's comedy, design, pop culture, music.

SAGAL: How did it come to be? How did you guys come up with this? Because nothing like it, I think, had ever been seen before. How'd you come up with it?

WINK: Well, we had a bunch of interest in things like design and science and comedy and drumming and music. And we knew that’d we never get a job that combined all those things.

(LAUGHTER)

WINK: So we, you know, actually started doing this as a labor of love and performed in - for our friends or in parties or in weird places that would have us. And we would get bald and blue and sometimes just walk around and see what happened.

SAGAL: Wait a minute on, you would walk around New York City bald and painted dark blue?

WINK: Yeah, it was kind of a social experiment. We would walk outside, and it was fun to get out of our own personas and see how people reacted. There was usually three reactions. It was either no reaction, they would get angry or they would get really excited.

SAGAL: Yeah.

BRIAN BABYLON: So I haven't heard you say drugs at all on...

(LAUGHTER)

BABYLON: ...How you started.

FAITH SALIE: In the origin story.

BABYLON: In the origin story, like, nothing?

PHIL STANTON: Well, we should make up a fake story that does involve drugs. But it was remarkably dry, believe it or not.

WINK: This was our alternative to drugs. Let's just say...

STANTON: Yeah.

SAGAL: Yeah.

WINK: ...The experimenting phase had already been...

SAGAL: 'Cause drugs are expensive and blue paint is not.

STANTON: So...

WINK: Our show is a drug, man.

SAGAL: Yeah.

GROSZ: Yeah, exactly.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: So guys, at what point – you were thinking we like science, we like movies, we like to bang on things - when did the blue come in, at what point?

WINK: Well, we needed some kind of equal opportunity alienator.

STANTON: He means gimmick.

WINK: Yeah, a gimmick.

SAGAL: Yeah.

WINK: Yeah, we needed a gimmick. So we wanted…

STANTON: No.

WINK: …To shock a Wall Streeter – I mean, like, a person with a Mohawk or, you know, a punk rocker, hip-hopper, Wall Streeter, housewife. We wanted to be equally other and also equally kind of compelling to each of those groups. +++

BABYLON: I’ll be honest with you, I’m a 6’3 black man, and I’m scared of the Blue Man Group.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: When you were developing the show - I know you have a lot of pretty elaborate bits - did you ever try anything that totally failed?

WINK: Oh, yeah.

STANTON: Oh, all the time.

WINK: One of the great things that we experienced a year or so into the run was we had this big finale in the show. Everything goes crazy. It's kind of a celebration. There's kind of EDM music pulsating, and there's paper everywhere and black light. And now we have lasers, and it's just nuts.

And one night, the sound system when we got to that - just as we got to that moment, the sound went dead. And it was silent. And there's all these lights flashing, but there was not a sound. And we just were like what are we going to do? And the audience - because we're blue and weird, the audience just thought it was a weird choice.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

STANTON: They just kept dancing anyway.

WINK: And they started making the sound themselves. It was really kind of pathetic. But it was so sweet to see the audience thinking like this is that Blue Man show we heard so much about. And like...

SAGAL: Then they had, like, this silent thing, and it was amazing. You guys could use that. You guys, like, walk into people's houses and take their food and stuff, and people would be like wow, cool art.

WINK: When we first - we didn't say that. When we first would go around, we would go to bars. And people would always buy us drinks. We'd just go to the bar and sit down. And people would come up to us and go you guys are weird. I'm going to buy you a drink.

(LAUGHTER)

STANTON: OK, there's no drugs, but there was a little bit of alcohol.

SAGAL: I understand.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, Chris and Phil, we are delighted to talk to you. We've asked you hear to play game we're calling...

KURTIS: I Have A Few Thoughts I'd Like To Share.

SAGAL: So the Blue Men famously say nothing, so we thought we'd ask you three questions about people who had a lot to say. Answer two of these three questions correctly, you'll win our prize one of our listeners - Carl Kasell's voice going on as long as they want on their voicemail. Bill, who are the original Blue Men playing for?

KURTIS: Steven Vandyke of Lansing, Mich.

SAGAL: All right, first question - a lot of very long talkers tend to be dictators because who's going to shut them up, right? Joseph Stalin once put out one of his very long speeches on vinyl records, one side of which was just what? A, Stalin singing his favorite Russian folk songs with (singing) la, la, la, la, la instead of most of the lyrics...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ...B, a half-hour, a solid 30 minutes of applause, or C, a series of Western commercial jingles which Stalin claimed to have written?

WINK: Oh my God, those are really bizarre...

(LAUGHTER)

WINK: ...Choices. You know, I think it was...

STANTON: Wow.

WINK: ...The commercials because they were into trying to, you know, explain that commercials were the American equivalent of propaganda.

STANTON: Yeah, I'm just - that's what I was going to choose, too. But I should go with something else just to be contrary, right?

WINK: Well, OK, what are the other options, applause?

SAGAL: So it was...

STANTON: I think he might've sung the whole side.

SAGAL: Stalin - so it's like Stalin singing some of his favorite folksongs...

WINK: Oh, yeah.

SAGAL: Just a half hour of applause, or...

WINK: You know what?

SAGAL: ...Western jingles.

STANTON: I'm going to go with the folksongs.

WINK: All right, I'm going to come back over to Phil's side. I think the commercials...

STANTON: The commercials though...

WINK: ...Are the more interesting answer...

(LAUGHTER)

WINK: But I think he probably did the folksongs.

STANTON: I don't know, think about it. You know...

(LAUGHTER)

STANTON: ...You know...

SAGAL: I can understand why it was important for you guys never to talk when you collaborated.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So I think by now we...

WINK: We've got a make a decision. Look at all the answers...

SAGAL: So you've got to make a decision. What's it going to be?

STANTON: They tried to steal from us, though. They tried to claim that they were the first in state in space. Oh, I guess they were.

WINK: They were.

(LAUGHTER)

WINK: I think he's right.

SAGAL: So what is it?

WINK: I think we’re going to go with the songs.

STANTON: OK, the songs.

WINK: The American, you know, propaganda jingles is a kind of interesting thing.

STANTON: It is.

WINK: But I don't think it was that smart.

SAGAL: So you...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So you started with the jingles, but you're giving up the jingles and you're going with the songs. Is that right?

WINK: Yeah, we're going with the songs.

STANTON: Songs.

SAGAL: You were both wrong. It's the applause.

SALIE: Oh, my gosh.

(APPLAUSE)

WINK: Oh, my gosh. That's impossible.

SAGAL: He put out this incredibly long speech on vinyl records.

STANTON: Oh, my God.

SAGAL: And there were four records, and, like, the first seven and a half sides were his speech, and the last side was just half an hour of applause.

STANTON: Wow.

WINK: Wow, that's - that's pretty cool.

SAGAL: It is.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The sort of things you get to do if you're Stalin. All right, you have two more chances. The record for the single-longest speech in the United Nations General Assembly is held by Krishna Menon of India. He did it back in 1955. His speech lasted for almost eight hours despite what happening? A, his Pakistani enemies releasing a hundred pigeons into the room in the middle of it, B, Mr. Menon collapsing and getting hospitalized halfway through the speech, or C, him really, really, really having to go to the bathroom for the last three hours of it.

WINK: Well, if the pigeons were released, that's pretty cool.

STANTON: Yeah.

WINK: How did they get them past security? I feel like we should vote - can we vote - I feel we should vote for the pigeons just because that's...

STANTON: I think so, too.

WINK: But it's not the pigeons.

STANTON: I want it to be the pigeons so bad.

WINK: It could be the bathroom one, but that's kind of boring. Like, in other words, if you guys pick that and base this whole question just that he had to go to the bathroom, then that's not very impressive.

(LAUGHTER)

GROSZ: Oh, way to put it, man.

STANTON: Yeah, who are the researchers?

WINK: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. So I'm going to put that on you. I'm going to pick the pigeons because if you pick that and base this question around that, then that's good on you. If you picked it on the bathroom one, then that's bad on you.

STANTON: I'm going to pick the pigeons because that's what I'd do.

WINK: Yeah, pigeons.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So you guys are amazing because the second time in a row you devoted all your attention to the two fake ones.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The real answer is that he collapsed halfway through, had to be hospitalized...

WINK: Oh, poor guy.

SAGAL: ...Was brought back to finish the speech under a doctor's supervision.

WINK: And there hasn't been a movie about it?

SAGAL: Apparently not.

STANTON: Wow.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, last question, maybe you'll get this one. The most recent crazy speech in the United Nations was given by the late Moammar Gadhafi back in 2009, a speech so long and crazy that what happened? A, 15 people in the audience fell into a coma while listening, B, his own translator shouted I can't take it anymore...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ...And fled the room, or C, the resonant vibrations from his shouting caused the podium in front of him to shatter.

WINK: Ooh, that would be pretty epic.

STANTON: Wow.

(LAUGHTER)

WINK: But that's kind of a - you know, an urban myth, you know, that whole opera-singing thing breaking a glass...

STANTON: Oh.

WINK: That doesn't really happen.

STANTON: Careful Chris, it's probably the right answer.

(LAUGHTER)

GROSZ: The right answer's going to be the one you guys don't talk about. So pick your top two and then pick the other one.

SAGAL: You know, I'm...

STANTON: What was number one again?

SAGAL: Number one was 15 people in the audience fell into a coma.

STANTON: Oh, that's not possible.

SALIE: No, that's happened here...

SAGAL: Yeah.

SALIE: ...Here right now.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

WINK: So that really...

STANTON: That doesn't seem plausible.

WINK: That doesn't seem credible. That seems beyond...

SAGAL: The second one was his own translator shouted I can't take it anymore and fled the room.

WINK: I love that one.

STANTON: It's got to be two, right?

WINK: Yeah, it was number two.

SAGAL: You're going to...

WINK: ...Number one...

WINK: You agree. And you did get it right. That's what happened.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: In the middle of the hour, forty-minute speech, the official Arabic translator just couldn't take it anymore, shouted that and fled the room.

Bill, we have to forget the official score do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, Chris and Phil kissed many frogs and finally found their prince. They got one right.

SAGAL: Yes, well, you did get one right.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So I’ve got to ask, 25 years – congratulations – is there going to be a second show from you guys, I mean, other than more different iterations of Blue Man?

WINK: You know, we are actually working on some new things right now for real. And some of them are very different ways that the Blue Man character can be in a show and others are shows that don’t even involve the Blue Man character.

SAGAL: Wow.

STANTON: No one on stage is the idea.

(LAUGHTER)

GROSZ: No one on stage and no music playing.

SAGAL: I would watch a show of just you guys arguing, just so you know.

(LAUGHTER)

STANTON: The No Man Group, I’m sorry.

WINK: No Man Group.

SAGAL: No Man Group. Chris Wink and Phil Stanton are two of the founding members of the Blue Man Group, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. Chris and Phil, thank you so much for joining us.

STANTON: Thank you.

WINK: Thank you.

Jace Clayton circles the globe looking for new sounds, from home studios in Morocco to teen parties in Mexico. Performing as DJ /rupture, he incorporates them into his work — and in his travels, he's found that digital technology has profoundly changed how music is produced, even in the most unlikely places.

That's the subject of his new book, Uproot: Travels in 21st-Century Music and Digital Culture. He joined NPR's Audie Cornish to talk about it; hear the radio version at the audio link, and read an edited version below.

Audie Cornish: There is no way to talk about modern music without talking about Auto-Tune. You trace the journey of that software, beginning as a studio tool for engineers to bend bad notes, to the ubiquitous sound on pop radio today. Things really start in 1999 with Cher's ""Believe""; what happened after that?

Uproot Travels in Twenty-First-Century Music and Digital Culture by Jace Clayton Paperback, 274 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

It created a new sound. The way it works is it goes in there and actually alters the waveforms of your voice. So it's this very intimate and strange modulation with technology. And it excites the ears in a way that few other things do.

And it becomes essentially a cosmetic tool, as people know — almost a joke, in the U.S. But you found it adopted in another scene: a Berber community in Morocco. And this is a community that is actually known for being somewhat isolated culturally. How did they get Auto-Tune? And what was their music tradition before?

The closest I found to an origin story is that a popular French film in 2000, 2001, had a scene in which an Arabic woman is in a cafe, and then they play a song and that song has Auto-Tune. People were watching this movie, and that was like, ""Wow"" — that sort of set the fire there.

One of the reasons why I'm so interested in Auto-Tune is that it wasn't physical: It was first distributed as software. And what that means for producers in far-flung locations is that you can buy it online; you can find a cracked copy, which was very likely the case there. It's no longer this situation where distribution is an issue.

How did seeing how it's used in these other communities make you feel different about it?

It really opened me up to the way in which even the sort of Western, widespread global technology, it's never totalizing. It's not one-size-fits-all, it's not just like pouring ketchup on everything on the dinner plate. People are listening to Auto-Tune differently in different countries, and in different regions within the countries.

You write about another musical journey in northern Mexico, the town of Monterrey, where you encountered a music called tribal. Where did this come from?

It is young Mexican kids using electronic music software and laptops to make this music, but it draws on their very specific location. So on the one hand, they're listening to their parents' and older siblings' sort of rodeo music, different types of Mexican country music and ballads, and that is present, structurally, as an influence. But then, somehow, psychedelic Israeli techno got really big in the rave scene in north Mexico. They call it ""psycho"" there; that's how it translates. But that is what these kids would go to and hear when they're out at the nightclubs, and all those influences are being shaken up and thrown out in this music called tribal guarachero. They're also thinking back to the indigenous past of Mexico and kind of reimagining that — so there's this whole sort of Aztec imaginary with jungle sounds and sampling of pre-Hispanic instrumentation.

Kind of imagining this history, and creating a call and response to it.

Exactly. And so I was like, this is what happens when the ideas of musical lineage — this begat that, begat that — are no longer that relevant in this type of very young, loop-based music.

In the past, people have talked about artists who ""lifted"" from communities that they encountered, or people will say, ""Well, this person actually stole this sound from X, Y and Z."" But you even ask, how do you share a music scene without ripping out its heart?



That's a key question, precisely because it's so easy for someone a thousand miles away from Monterrey to do a quick search and say, ""Oh, I can make that."" And you sort of mimic the music structurally, but with no knowledge of all the various conditions that gave rise to it.

Were there any examples from the book that did cross that line?

[Laughs] Yeah. I'm mostly talking about about moments of creation, but I do have a few moments where I dip into, like, ""Let's look at the music industry."" For example, there's a chapter on what I call ""World Music 2.0,"" where I discuss how this whole term of ""world music"" was an industry phrase. It came out of a meeting with record label executives in 1987 in London. They were saying, ""Paul Simon's Graceland was a huge it. There's a niche, but how can we market it? Should we call it ""hot""? Should we call it ""tropical""? And in the end, they went for world music. That's how that happened; the notes are online. It's totally fascinating to see.

How have you come to think of the term ""world music"" today?

When I think of world music, it's that people all over the world now have these inexpensive digital tools, and they're using those to express themselves musically and sort of connect with the world, and fold in all these influences in a way that was never before possible."

As Joseph, sisters Allison, Meegan and Natalie Closner sing in tight harmony, fitting stylistically alongside fellow sister acts like First Aid Kit, Haim, The Staves and Lily & Madeleine. But along the way, they carve out a spot of their own, as they fill their second album with an appealing mix of swoony delicacy and punchy anthems. On I'm Alone, No You're Not, sweetness and power aren't mutually exclusive.

Punctuated by peppy, remix-friendly songs of devotion (""Blood & Tears"") and resistance (""White Flag""), I'm Alone, No You're Not finds the Oregon-bred sisters delving into luscious ballads (""I Don't Mind""), spirited dance-pop (""SOS [Overboard]"") and songs that build to cavernously booming, kick-drum-intensive rock (the appropriately titled ""Canyon""). Joseph may have gotten its start playing living-room shows, but these songs are more than sturdy enough to support the layers of studio polish they get here.

With the help of Bright Eyes producer Mike Mogis — whose work with First Aid Kit had already established his gift for wrangling and complementing impeccable sister harmonies — Joseph sounds fully formed on I'm Alone, No You're Not. Even better, these songs have a clearly defined and distinct point of view: The Closner sisters sing beautifully, sure, but they share their voices in the service of songs about fearlessness, commitment and the pursuit of a life fully lived."

A U.S. service member was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan's restive Helmand province Tuesday — the second U.S. combat death in Afghanistan since January.

The service member was conducting ""train, advise, assist activities"" with Afghan forces when the explosive device went off, according to the U.S. Defense Department. Another American service member and six Afghan soldiers were wounded in the attack near the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.

""We are deeply saddened by this loss, but remain committed to helping our Afghan partners provide a brighter future for themselves and their children,"" said Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

NPR's Tom Bowman reports for our Newscast unit:

""[The attack] comes as 100 additional U.S. troops have been sent to Helmand Province to advise and assist Afghan police. ""Earlier this year, the U.S. command sent 500 U.S. soldiers to train Afghan troops in Helmand, where the Taliban is seizing more territory and threatening the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. ""Most of the 10,000 American troops in Helmand and throughout Afghanistan are training local troops and work out of large bases. Still, some U.S. special operations troops continue to partner with Afghan soldiers on missions. ""In January, an American Green Beret, Sgt. Matthew McClintock, was killed in Helmand in a Taliban attack.""

Reporting on Taliban gains near Lashkar Gah, The Associated Press adds:

""The Taliban have seized a number of nearby districts in recent weeks and now threaten to overrun the city itself. Local officials have estimated that around 80 percent of the province has fallen or is in danger of falling to the Taliban.""

The Defense Department says 23 U.S. service members have been killed in Afghanistan since combat operations ended nearly two years ago.

The slain service member's name is being withheld until next-of-kin can be notified."

Barbra Streisand's cheekily entertaining and sometimes touching new album, Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, sounds like the skits and music of an extravagantly staged awards show without the awards. It also has the feel of a late-night gathering of show people as they share favorite, and in some cases virtually unknown, tunes and scenes — at the home of a hostess who just happens to have an orchestra lying around.

Encore is an amiable Broadway/Hollywood mashup of vintage production values and modern casting. Like Streisand's 2014 album Partners, a collection of duets with male singers ranging from Billy Joel and Lionel Richie to John Legend and John Mayer, this new record finds her in fine voice among a diverse range of pairings — and an opening trio, ""At The Ballet"" from A Chorus Line, with Anne Hathaway and Daisy Ridley. A special edition available only at Target stores adds four Streisand solo tracks, including two of Stephen Sondheim's most moving numbers: ""Losing My Mind"" from Follies and ""Not A Day Goes By"" from Merrily We Roll Along.

Another Sondheim song, ""The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened"" from the lesser-known Road Show, demonstrates a couple of the album's strengths: unusual programming and easy chemistry with unexpected guests, in this case a gently swinging Alec Baldwin. The sweeping ""Any Moment Now,"" sung with Hugh Jackman, is from a stage adaptation by A Chorus Line composer Marvin Hamlisch of the brilliant 1975 beauty-pageant mockumentary Smile. And new words for ""Anything You Can Do,"" with a funny Melissa McCarthy, allow Streisand to joke about herself and where she lives. (Did you know Streisand has a mall in her house? She has a mall in her house.)

""Does the world ever frighten you?"" asks Seth MacFarlane before singing — and whistling — ""Pure Imagination"" from Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. Like actor Chris Pine, who joins Streisand for an affecting medley of ""I'll Be Seeing You"" and ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face,"" MacFarlane has a voice that could fit comfortably into any period of American crooning between the Eisenhower years and now.

The album wraps with an inspirational dialogue between Streisand and Jamie Foxx, which leads into their majestically paced, gospel-inflected ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain."" After the peak, the song and record finish with a flourish of brass and the fading thunder of a bass drum, a grand Hollywood ending to another chapter of an epic — and unfinished — career."

He roams between time periods, genres and media, drawing unexpected parallels, and his latest book, Known and Strange Things, is a collection of his essays written for publications like The New York Times Magazine and The New Yorker.

""I love to love things,"" Cole tells NPR's Ari Shapiro. Which means he doesn't mind writing about Great — capital-G Great — works of art. ""I can sort of understand that Beethoven is Great, but that's not what's interesting about him to me,"" he says. ""What's interesting is that there's somebody who was writing music in the 18-teens, and I'm listening to it in the 21st century, and I'm actually being moved by it ... so to the commonality, to sort of let that history dissolve and know that art can not only transcend the years, but that it can also transcend all the layers of commentary that have accreted on top of it. So for that reason, I try not to give myself any complexes about any of the stuff I approach.""

Interview Highlights

On whether his own African and American history allows him to cross cultural borders

I think it helps a bit. But I think culture itself is moving in that direction anyway, where being omnivorous is normal. How do I put it? The individual who is at the center of our formal political arrangement is the president of the United States. But when he releases his summer playlist, or his reading list, it is extremely eclectic, and it is expected to be extremely eclectic. And of course, we're aware of the extreme elements of calculation and propaganda ... but having said all that, I'm not doing it in order to be zeitgeisty.

On criticizing the distinction between fiction and nonfiction

We want to be moved; we want our eye to be enchanted. So when I look at an exhibition of Degas ... I don't say, oh, that painting, is it nonfiction? Because what actually matters is the state of enchantment he is able to make out of fictional and nonfictional material. So this insistence in writing, I mean, I understand it for sure, if we are writing a news report, stuff needs to be factually cross-checked, but we also have to understand that in the writing itself, there's so much artful placement and arrangement. What we really want to be is in the presence of somebody who has thought about something and has delivered their thoughts in a composed and edited way.

On reading recommendations for election season

You know, in times like this, especially in this present moment, there's this tendency to be reactive to every small little bit of news. In a way that's actually not very productive for us, because we know that what we need to do is go to the polls and do the necessary, and not sort of keep up with every small outrage. So I actually find it tremendously helpful to focus my attention on things that are just really removed from this world, and to just think about a different space. I've found it really lovely of late to go back to Miles Davis. And if I go back and listen to Sketches of Spain, for example, it just evokes a whole other world. It's a beautiful and perfectly made work of art that is helping me cope with the right now."

When the financial crisis hit in 2008, Imbolo Mbue lost her job. ""I was very disillusioned about America ..."" she tells NPR's Rachel Martin. ""I was unemployed for over a year and a half.""

Originally from Limbe, Cameroon, Mbue came to U.S. to go to college. After losing her job, she had to start over from scratch — and that led to her sitting down to write her debut novel Behold the Dreamers. One day, while walking down the street, ""I got an inspiration to write this story,"" she says.

Her protagonists, Jende and Neni, are two Cameroonian immigrants trying to make it in New York. But the recession threatens their livelihood and strains their marriage.

""For me, personally, the financial crisis laid bare a lot about the way in which the American dream is not that accessible to everybody ..."" Mbue says. The novel gave her a way to explore and express how the financial crisis affected her perspective on America.

On Limbe, Cameroon, the hometown she shares with her characters

It's a beautiful seaside town ... in the south of Cameroon ... about 80,000 people. Back when I was growing up it wasn't a very fancy town – we didn't have a public library, we didn't have nice hotels, we probably had like one or two hotels. But now it's fairly developed.

We have lots of nice hotels and nightclubs and a lot of tourists come to Cameroon to see Limbe because it has really beautiful black sand beaches. But it's still a place where it's very difficult to change your circumstances if you are born poor.

On how she came to the U.S.

I had relatives who were very generous to sponsor me to come to America to have an education. So I came here to go to college — I went to Rutgers in New Jersey. And then after [college] I moved to New York City and I went to Columbia for my masters.

On expectations of America

What I'd seen about America on TV was, you know, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and The Cosby Show and everything was so glamorous. And I didn't really see much of the difficulty and challenges of being in American — the poverty, the racism — I didn't see much of that.

I think it was the same for Jende and Neni — they had this idea of America being this really, really wonderful place — and it is a wonderful place, it's a beautiful country — but there are challenges to being an immigrant here. ...

[They] are struggling to get by as immigrants ... even if there are opportunities, it's still a challenge to move out of poverty. I've seen that in my life, too.

On the definition of success

They both believe in the American dream. So they had similar ideas, but like in any marriage, at some point people start changing and they start having different ideas of what America means to them. ...

I think for Jende and Neni it was very much about the price they had to pay for this dream. ... They both had to consider: This is the price I have to pay to have the life I want in America and is this price worth it?"

Over the weekend we asked Ann Powers and Jason King to wrestle with Frank Ocean's long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Channel Orange. They did so across many time zones and man hours; what emerged is a conversation that stays fair-minded and grounded and ends in questioning both the artist and his audience. We find it impossible and personally limiting to consider this album outside of its context, so the below is as much a state of affairs as it is a straight-ahead review.

(Ann Powers and Jason King write about both the physical and digital versions of the album interchangeably. And without clarity regarding the whole listing vs. cover art spelling situation, we're calling it Blonde throughout.)

Ann Powers: When he began to put himself into the mind-frame that would inspire his new album Blonde, Frank Ocean imagined himself in a moving car. He was, in this waking dream, a girl. ""Two years ago I found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face,"" the artist wrote in an essay posted on his Tumblr the day this weekend the album, four years in the making, finally became available."" A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head."" Ocean imagined himself wriggling against the seatbelt, he wrote, playing with its tension until it no longer constrained him. This feeling of freedom within containment, of traveling at a high speed on a course that is smooth and open — and of being comfortable with motion even in your most vulnerable, childlike moods — was the one that best fed the creativity he needed to complete an album as highly anticipated as any to come out this year, even though, since he relocated from California to the clogged streets of London, Ocean doesn't even drive much any more.

Ocean is a car enthusiast in real life. When he lived in Los Angeles, he owned three BMWs and was rebuilding a fourth. He populates his artistic world with references to Ferraris and Bugattis, the way many rappers do, but also to Acuras and Camrys, conduits to solitude, pleasure and escape for more average folk. In ""Nights,"" one of the 17 circuitous, absorbing tracks on the digital version of Blonde, the New Orleans-born Ocean remembers cruising in his family's Honda before Katrina forced him out of the city. ""Kept at least six discs in the changer,"" he recalls, rhyming in a sing-song cadence over a woozy keyboard line. It's easy to imagine that CD changer containing the music that drifts and melds within the hard-to-define sound Ocean cultivates on Blonde: Stevie Wonder next to The Beatles next to Crescent City rappers and his mom's Hammond organ-driven gospel favorites. In other songs, Ocean locates erotic pleasure within car interiors, and safety ""like an armored truck,"" and even rebirth, when he finds the feathers of a mythical phoenix on his dashboard. (It must have been a Pontiac.) But ""Nights"" places the sound of Blonde itself within that cocoon-like space, connecting it to a process of listening and absorbing hours of source material which, though it might be shared with one or two fellow riders, is ultimately private and introspective, the quiet side of taking the open road.

""The stillness is the move,"" goes the hook of a song by the Dirty Projectors, whose vocalist Amber Coffman is one of many guests from the cutting edges of various music scenes who appear on Blonde. The idea expressed in that phrase is fundamental to Ocean's musical approach, even more so now than in his earlier work that challenged received ideas of both R&B and indie pop. The rhythms on Blonde are cool, languid and minimal. Guitar and keyboard lines swell and brush against each other, rarely coalescing into hooks or stirring choruses. Some tracks are as dense as they are short, while others segment and land in structures that don't conform to traditional songcraft at all. The stories he tells within these prismatic songs, many explicitly erotic, gain their power from the music's tonal shifts and hard to track reference points. The lyrics only half-tell them, though, and only in deep dialogue with music that carries the listener deeper into reflection.

Introversion defines Ocean's stance throughout Blonde, even when he's reaching out to a lover; those lovers are often merely shadows on the passenger seat anyway. One reason his music captures so many people's imaginations now is that it's supremely ruminative, dedicated to exploring how memories drift, dissolve, reassemble themselves to form the narratives that inwardly define us, and how desire arises within a story each person tells herself as she reaches toward another. ""Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought that could think of the dreamer in the thought,"" Ocean rhymes in ""Seigfried,"" imagining God at the end of that particular road, but not the lover for whom he longs. A guitar loop forms a membrane around the image, expanding it infinitely. When, moments later, he murmurs, ""I'd do anything for you"" to the object of his longing, the feeling is peaceful, infusing heartache with mindfulness. This is what Ocean offers that listeners crave — an antidote to the industrious and cynical persona building that dominates so much of popular culture now; a focus on process that feels so foreign to many listeners that they consider it a mystery. It's not a mystery. It's an articulation of what happens when each of us keeps her thoughts to herself.

Jason King: So Blonde is the album that was formerly going to be known as Boys Don't Cry (which has now become the name of a one-off 360-page magazine associated with the physical release of the album that you could, briefly, pick up in four pop-ups, newsstands and a bookstore, in LA, New York, Evanston, Ill. and London). The original album title would have been especially fitting this week, as it so eerily resonates with the arresting photograph and accompanying video of 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh, the baby from Aleppo who sat drenched in blood and dust and stunned into silence after rescue workers removed him from post-airstrike rubble and propped him up in an emergency vehicle. Part of the reason that image has circulated so widely as a profound commentary on the horrors of the Syrian conflict is that Omran doesn't cry in the face of such catastrophe; instead, he looks like the oldest of old souls, and we find ourselves watching him work through unimaginable trauma in real-time. Indeed, we're watching him while his life is splitting in two and tearing apart; if he's frazzled, or discombobulated, Omran is bravely keeping it inside, or he has no expression for what he's feeling. Boys don't cry, in part, because men refuse to cry: the toxic masculinity and weaponized lack of empathy that underwrite so many of our most pressing contemporary geopolitical conflicts are just two of the elements that have helped foment the incredibly tragic situation that Omran finds himself in.

And so it's fitting, given the times in which we live, that Frank Ocean has made a deeply empathetic and passionate album that's partly about his own ongoing struggle with masculinity and emotionalism. Quilted from fragmented ideas, observations and submerged memories around the vicissitudes of heartbreak and loss, Ocean manages to process his relation to that personal trauma for us in the most intimate and fragile of ways. We're listening to him work through some deeply personal moments, even if we don't always know what the referents for those moments are. I can't help but note that some of the most potent recordings this year made by black men — such as The Life of Pablo by Kanye West and Chance the Rapper's mixtape Coloring Book — wade deeply, and even self-consciously, into impressionistic emotionalism and into gospel-influenced questions of existence. And they offer us existential musings at a crucial time, when far too many people still can't seem to figure out whether black lives matter enough to change their own.

And yet nothing is ever so straight-ahead or open-faced with Ocean. His music, like his career as a whole, more often than not revolves around ambiguities and offhand non sequiturs. Apple Music lists the digital version as Blonde, as does the magazine page that serves as the physical's gatefold, but the cover art reads Blond. Here, as on previous efforts, Ocean seems profoundly interested in identities that, for any number of reasons, have become torn apart (his own and those of the other characters he observes, too). He's obsessed with people whose lives are split between past and present realities, people who move erotically between men and women, between warring ideals of masculine and feminine, and black and white, and gay and straight. This weekend alone, he released one audiovisual work and two different versions of the same album, and, though the two versions are not radically different from each other (there are five more tracks on the digital than the physical, but the physical includes two that aren't on the digital), I think he wants us to know he goes both ways in all aspects of life. At the very least, he doesn't subscribe to the idea of one thing or the other.

To be fair, I'm also of two minds about Blonde: musically and sonically, it's certainly consistent with today's conceptually-artsy hip-hop and R&B-influenced pop, including Rihanna's ANTI and Beyoncé's Lemonade, as well James Blake's The Colour in Anything and maybe even Banks' forthcoming The Altar. But critics' gleeful celebration these days of anything that registers as experimental ""avant-soul"" — if that term ever even really suits the music — usually neglects to mention intrinsic flaws such as drifty songwriting that is too often formless and the pursuit of tone that is too often samey. It's hard to be definitive about these critiques with Ocean's newest releases. Taken together, Endless and Blonde were designed to flood the commercial marketplace in the late summer, and they've done so in a way that means — at least for journalists tasked with covering the musical and pop cultural moment — there's really just too much complex music to digest well in such a compressed time. Both records could gain in their power and resonance as we have a chance to really dig in a bit more; or their flaws may appear more pronounced in the absence of hype and four long years of expectation and anticipation.

Ann Powers: Though Ocean is often romanticized as a mysterious figure and his music cast as avant-garde, it's perhaps more informative to think of Blonde as his way of revisiting and, in so doing, recasting the canon of classic rock. He's been open about the influence of The Beatles, whose ""Here, There, and Everywhere"" he quotes in the song ""White Ferrari,"" and The Beach Boys, whose Brian Wilson almost enlisted him as a collaborator last year (although Wilson has said that didn't work out because Ocean ""wanted to do rap""). Wilson's influence is strong throughout Blonde, ringing through its lyrical melodies and ornate yet cleanly constructed arrangements. There's also something very Brian about the way Ocean always seems to stand alone within his compositions, even though his list of collaborators numbers in the dozens. Frequently dwelling over states of dislocation and loneliness, Ocean's songs touch a nerve similar to those that The Beach Boys' sad auteur captured. When Wilson, as an adult, was making Smile, he called his grandiose, innocent-sounding songs ""a teenage symphony to God."" Parts of Blonde are more psychedelic than even Wilson's more far-out efforts, exhibiting less craving for radio airplay. It could be called a teenage symphony to weed.

Yet Ocean's mind games never stray too far from his grounding in sensuality. This is something he shares with the Beatle I'd bet is his favorite, Paul McCartney, along with a wry sense of humor that shows itself in punny wordplay (boy, does Frank love homonym-ish pairings like ""solo"" and ""so low"" or ""inhale and ""in hell"") and in colorful descriptions of street scenes and shady characters. Something essential in Ocean's songs celebrates the pleasure of music itself. It feels so good when he lets his voice loose on an arching chorus or croons his way through a well-modulated verse, exhibiting the same kind of tunefulness that got Macca labeled ""the cute one."" Ocean's cute bona fides are reinforced by other reference points: in the essence of Burt Bacharach that infuses his Beyoncé collaboration, ""Pink + White,"" and the way he pays homage to Stevie Wonder paying homage to the easy-listening, hard-loving Carpenters in his attenuated but striking retake of ""Close To You.""

Wonder is a crucial figure within Ocean's realm of influence, another African-American emissary between musical genres whose experimentalism was tempered by a killer pop sense. With the inimitable run of joyfully mind-expanding albums that began with 1972's Music of My Mind, Wonder toppled the racist hierarchies that placed the efforts of white musicians like Wilson and The Beatles above those by the African-American ""entertainers"" whose innovations had, in fact, provided the basis for all of rock. On his last album, Channel Orange, Ocean made the Wonder connections obvious, whereas here they're more confined as he explores other palettes, including a host of guitar effects inspired by British bands like U2. (Brian Eno, who pioneered the ""infinite guitar"" sound frequently invoked on Blonde, is listed in the album's credits, though whether he worked on the recording or was merely sampled is unclear.) But Ocean continues to aim for that spirit of effortless artiness, and of experimentation grounded in pleasure and the pursuit of beauty, at the heart of Wonder's work.

Pleasure is one of Ocean's main preoccupations. One way to listen to Blonde is as an album about sex: from the droll reference to masturbation that begins ""Solo,"" to the lascivious come-ons of ""Self Control"" to the blatant descriptions that still come off as romantic in ""Skyline To,"" Ocean embraces carnality as a treasure, sometimes frustrating because of its elusiveness but always worth pursuing. The frankness Ocean embraces is, of course, a central element of much American popular music and has been since the women who made the blues popular in the early 20th century spoke openly of the power, heat and sorrow in their own hips. In some ways, pop today is more explicit than ever; hip-hop has considerably furthered the artistry of the off-color metaphor, and R&B's bedroom jams celebrate sexual satisfaction in no uncertain terms. (Rock has actually grown more prudish in recent years, tending toward a sort of chaste earnestness or the high school-level jokes of the Warped Tour.) Ocean connects with those histories in his work. Yet throughout Blonde, he tells stories of sexual connection and disconnection that take on a different character than is often evident in current pop. His very matter-of-factness strips away the posturing that demands sexuality be a public performance and reinstates a believable sense of intimacy. That Ocean's own sexuality is, as he describes it, ""dynamic"" — a quality he shares with many millennials and teens, who increasingly reject binary terms to describe both gender and desire — makes Blonde radical, not because he is anywhere near alone, but because he calmly insists that the listener embrace his view of pleasure as unexceptional, healthy, canonical.

Jason King: Ann, although intimacy and interiority are clearly part of what's compelling about Frank Ocean in 2016, he's also defined by a profound exteriority — his trickster-like fondness for showbiz hype. There aren't that many musicians left in 2016 who can conjure up Event Pop: in the '80s, Michael Jackson turned every album release into a full-fledged cultural happening; and more recently, entertainers like Beyoncé and Kanye West (and Radiohead, to a lesser degree) have carried the gloved one's baton with aplomb. Ocean's palette of tools, like enigma, teasing, misdirection and outright silence, may have ultimately managed to turn Blonde and Endless into cultural phenomena rather than just product.

Even in the streaming music era, in which increasingly fewer listeners have any real need to digest albums as integral wholes, Ocean remains that rare musician who has never not been an album artist. It's not just that he clearly knows how to put out albums with maximum fanfare, it's that he knows how to make art with a capital A, aided and abetted by a tightly-curated VIP list of collaborators on Blonde that includes Andre 3000, Tyler the Creator, Pharrell Williams and Endless' Jonny Greenwood. Plus, the twisted, lo-fi images of the music video for ""Nikes"" (directed by Tyrone Lebon) remind us that Ocean's music can never be fully extracted from the visuals (his lyrics are already themselves cinematic). If Ocean weren't making music, he'd probably be raking in bucks at an ad agency.

On Blonde, Ocean continues to make music that's an artistic distillation of Lexapro-era tristesse; he's got that in common with failure-obsessed millennial peers, everyone from album collaborator James Blake to Lena Dunham to The Weeknd. And even more than Channel Orange, Blonde — equal parts psychedelic indie rock, post-IDM electronica, post-U2/Coldplay-esque Eno-pop, post-Drake hip-hop, and post-Maxwell drifty soul/R&B —becomes an impressive showcase for Frank Ocean the creative producer. Those experimental, druggy sonics abound, showing up in the fried vocals and pitch-shifting on ""Nikes"" to the ambient whistles in ""Solo"" to the Rotary-Connection-like delayed vocals on ""Pretty Sweet"" to the scraping, backwards effects on ""Seigfried.""

Blonde's raw, bleeding, diaristic storytelling somehow makes me think about Sinead O'Connor, whose 1990 album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got was one of the first to seamlessly merge R&B, pop, rock and sampled hip-hop beats, in the context of confessional, warts-and-all lyrics about relationships lost and existential interiority. I'd argue that more than 25 years later, Blonde takes root in the world Sinead made possible: its best songs are troubled relationship tunes that feel like ripped pages in a worn diary, and they're often dark, moody and dream-like sinister, like the work of David Lynch or Frank Miller. On ""Ivy,"" Ocean writes breathlessly poetic lyrics: ""I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me / It started from nothing / I had no chance to prepare / I couldn't see you coming."" And on tuneful ""Solo"" he eloquently writes of ""A bull and a matador dueling in heaven / It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire / Inhale, inhale, that's heaven.""

Blonde also owes some debt to Meshell Ndegeocello, whose underappreciated 2000s albums like Cookie, Comfort Woman and Devil's Halo directly laid ground for the eccentric fusion of experimental soul, pop, R&B, rock and hip-hop we hear on Blonde. Like Ocean, Ndegeocello is black and queer, and raps and sings, and has always had an interest in alternative imaginings of masculinity in the context of either/or identities (the title of her outré 2007 album The World Has Made Me the Man of Our Dreams says it all). But bassist Meshell is known as a musician's musician with technical chops, whereas Ocean comes by much of his conventional musicianship externally, via collaborators (when, as Ann mentioned, on ""Close to You,"" he reworks Stevie Wonder vocoder samples and on ""White Ferrari,"" as he interpolates The Beatles; on ""Seigfried,"" where he draws liberally on an Elliot Smith melody).

You've noted that Ocean's songs come to us as fragments and ideas that challenge the conventions of pop and R&B, and yet he seems to have strayed very far from the tight slickness of songs like ""Novocaine"" on Nostalgia, Ultra. I'm not sure whether that's a step forward or backward. Certainly, anyone looking for Frank Ocean the strategic songsmith who once crafted a melodic nugget like ""I Miss You"" for Queen B might find far too much of Blonde meandering or unhemmed. The challenge for me is less about songwriting, and more about the deliberate lack of groove that comes as a result of Blonde's neglect of drums or basslines on songs like ""Skyline To."" To draw on that car metaphor, I want Blonde's engine to rev up more often than it does, and I'm occasionally disappointed when it doesn't.

Ann Powers: Jason, you address crucial issues that are so often overlooked, especially today, when the symbolic gestures of identity and power that our pop stars enact are mistaken for actual heroism. Ocean has the potential to influence people's views on love, sex, race and identity, and maybe the most open-hearted elements of Blonde will do so. Or, in the mainstream, he could just be another transient sensation. The helium atmosphere of sudden album releases and other highly engaging pseudo-events makes it hard to know how this album's impact will translate over time. Like a sullen millennial taking his most important college admissions test, Ocean answered years of hanging in the background with a weekend of high-profile overachieving. Music fans and the media were stunned to attention, as you've noted, by fancy graphics and a poem about McDonald's by Kanye West, confusing streaming options and the lines at those pop-ups. Will we still be listening to Blonde when the fall leaves turn? Only time will reveal its place in pop history. That lineage itself is changing; no longer do artifacts like albums occupy its center.

When an album does make a noticeable impact today, it's because a community coalesces around it. That's what happened with Lemonade, another collection of first-person songs that employed visuals to amplify its meanings and capture a larger audience than it likely would have as a mere musical release. Calling on a history book's worth of African-American women's expressive culture, Beyoncé's very personal (or, at least, strategically confessional) account of a rocky period in a marriage was embraced as a monumental act of making lives visible and audible. ""Lemonade is Beyoncé's intimate look into the multigenerational making and magic of black womanhood,"" wrote Zandria F. Robinson in Rolling Stone. The superstar's ability to connect her ""I"" with that ""we"" made not just a hit, but history.

Ocean does not seem inclined to reach out in this way. His own visual album, as I said in our previous discussion of Endless, felt more like a process-oriented conceptual art piece. And you're right about the songs on Blonde sparsely containing the elements that usually unite people behind a pop offering — most notably memorable beats. If the people can't dance, will anyone be part of your revolution?

Maybe Ocean doesn't really care. If the most prominent voices besides his own on Blonde indicate anything, it's that he's chosen a peer group only marginally interested in cultivating renown. Andre 3000, a legendary rapper who's repeatedly rejected the spotlight, claims the central cameo. Kendrick Lamar, whose recent success does demonstrate a strong sense of mission connected to fame, is present on one track, but mostly as a sound-effects generator. Ocean also relegates Beyoncé to background status in the last few bars of ""Pink + White."" It takes some chutzpah to put the Queen in that position.

A more telling partnership is the one Ocean shares on ""White Ferrari"" with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and James Blake, his bros in Auto-Tuned anguish. Beyond the lyrical references to both tripping and getting naked, which are very Frank, the track could have been made by any of those three beloved artistes. Here's where Ocean lives most comfortably right now, it seems: in the middle ground between high art and the arena, where a sympathetic audience will be patient with his musical wandering and lyrical obfuscations.

Yet Ocean also still pledges fealty to the crew that first nurtured him, the hip-hop iconoclasts of Odd Future. The final track on Blonde is ""Futura Free,"" a vocally distorted meditation on the tedium of success that concludes with a conversation, recorded long ago, with a couple of Ocean's old pals from that milieu. (One is his brother, the other, the skateboarder Sage Elsasser.) The voices, just kids' then, try to put a finger on their ambitions; nobody can really articulate what he wants. ""How far is a light year?"" someone asks. Ocean muddles this final question in noise. Is he ready to trace how far he's come? For now, he seems content to just share his view of the ride.

Jason King: Ocean's interest in the choreography of interpersonal relationships, and his poetic approach to missed opportunities for connection — people coming together, getting together, drifting apart — is certainly part of the melancholic beauty of his music. He paints erotic desire in complex hues and colors when so many of his musical peers are still using Crayolas.

We all know that in 2012, Ocean came out of the closet by refuting a cut-and-dry interpretation of his sexuality (and his lyrics), causing a seismic ripple in the default heteronormativity of hip-hop and R&B. In retrospect, he helped spawn the post-closet overground, creating space for the likes of queer, queer-identified and queer-allied artists ranging from Azealia Banks to Sam Smith and, yes, even Macklemore. Ann, as you note, Ocean has always approached sexual preference as fluid and dynamic, and he's mostly performed being queer more as a casual, implicit reality than some sort of external public achievement.

""Good Guy"" is a sketch of a song that appears to be the only explicit lyrical mention of same gender desire on Blonde. And even still, the narrative is broken in two: the first half is about a failed date at a gay bar, the second half is a conversation between two guys complaining about ""not having b****** no more."" Other songs (like ""Self Control,"" ""Ivy"" and ""Nights"") and sections of songs that deal with troubled love affairs specify no clear gender; they could go either way. Perhaps much of the album is about failed same-sex love; perhaps it is not. (We also don't really know yet to whom or what ""Seigfried"" refers). Other songs like ""Nikes"" make very specific reference to women (""these b****** want Nikes / they looking for a check""). While the promotion of sexual fluidity is rooted in allowing people to define sexuality away from conventions and binaries — though increasing research is demonstrating that sexuality is not quite as fluid a spectrum as Kinsey once argued — Ocean's circumscribed discussions of explicit same sex desire could be frustrating, rather than liberating, for many within and outside of LGBTQ communities.

In this light, Ann, Ocean's car motifs continue to fascinate, but I can't help also think that they are his main performative connection to a highly conventional symbol of machismo (which he, to his credit, acknowledges in his magazine when he says it might be linked to a ""deep, subconscious straight boy fantasy""). This is to say nothing of his continued evocation of drug-use, his lyrical use of invectives like ""n****"" and ""b******"" and not-uncommon mention of the word ""p****"" — all of which cosmologically connects him more closely to the PMRC sticker hip-hop tradition than to a sensual, retro R&B one.

I've written before that one of the reasons Ocean found widespread acceptance where other queer R&B and pop artists have failed — beyond his evocation of rock tropes like the guitar and his tales of straight women in strip clubs — is because there's a total absence of camp in his work. Moreover, in a song like ""Nikes,"" he shouts-out felled influences like A$AP Yams and Pimp C (rest in peace) and even Trayvon Martin — but there's no similar mention of slain LGB and trans folk (his emotional outpouring on Tumblr following the Orlando mass shooting doesn't explicitly show up in his Blonde lyrics). I say this not to police what Frank Ocean can or should say, nor how he should say it — only to mention there is a long venerable tradition where queer artists (in or out of the closet) engage in pre-emptive heteronormativity in the effort to avoid stigma and to fully crossover to straight audiences. It would be terribly tragic if Ocean's minimal attention to these matters in his lyrics happened to follow suit in that tradition.

I've recently been considering the idea that Napster helped create the reluctant pop star: so many musicians after 1999, in the absence of traditional record sales, found other ways to earn or bolster incomes, and found more stable lives to live. You see the evolution of the reluctant pop star today in the form of actor Donald Glover or golfer Justin Timberlake, where pop stardom is something you do on the side while you're doing everything else. You also see it in the form of Sia or Zayn, where being a pop star (beyond making pop music) is simply a burden to be dealt with, or a way of life that you shuttle off to the corner, like the act of moving a mound of wasabi away from your sushi.

Ocean seems to me the epitome of this millenia's reluctant pop star — he's a shrinking violet who went mostly invisible for the last four years; he rarely shows up to public events; and while he obviously knows how to write a solid radio-friendly pop song, he's become largely absorbed by other aesthetic pursuits. But the concept of the reluctant pop star has also merged into the concept of the silent pop star — that reclusive artist who rarely, if ever, does interviews, has highly controlled outgoing communications and practices withholding information from the public and press as a matter of course. Caginess and silence also happen to be the strategies of those of who know, or have known, something about living in closets.

In that sense, it's a bit of letdown that other than that off-the-cuff mention of Trayvon Martin in ""Nikes"" (""RIP Trayvon, that n**** look just like me""), nothing on Blonde speaks explicitly to the #blacklivesmatter movement (though one could generously look the album as a whole as impressionistically arguing for the importance of black life). Nothing on Blonde addresses the extreme crisis that is happening right now in black LGBT communities where the CDC has found that one out of every two black men who has sex with men is projected to become infected with HIV. This crisis is not just limited to the U.S.: it connects with the devastating criminalization of homosexuality in African nations like Nigeria and Uganda and European countries like Russia, and to the unacceptable persecution and brutalization of LGBT communities by terrorist groups like ISIS.

To be clear, I'm not making an argument that Ocean doesn't think about such things or that his heart doesn't bleed like everyone else's. It's also perfectly OK to not be a spokesperson or a role model or an activist, especially as pop and politics do not always make comfortable bedfellows. It's OK, and even progressive in some ways, to pursue a more sophisticated vision/version of what it means to be ""out"" than the rigid binary model currently embraced by global pride movements. And yet, given that he's released an album that's so raw, stripped-down and intimate, and believing as of course I do that Frank Ocean does indeed cry over the real time, existential threats that surely inform his everyday life as a not-completely-straight black American man making mainstream pop music given his considerable platform in 2016, I have to ask where, years after hauntingly evocative tracks like ""Bad Religion,"" is his will and courage — and maybe even his skill — to bring those life-and-death, topical concerns into his recordings? Or does his crossover super-ambition — as James Baldwin might put it, the price of the ticket — make the act of doing so simply out of his reach?"

In the romance world we love to say that the RITAs are the Oscars of romance — a fitting comparison not only in terms of prestige but also, unfortunately, in terms of representation. Out of the more than 90 RITA finalists this year, only five have protagonists who aren't white. The good — and bad news — is that this is actually an improvement over past years.

For all my unsatisfied hunger for diverse characters in books, I was somewhat nervous to start reading these; it's a pet peeve of mine when a character's major inner conflict is their racial heritage. Sure, it's hard to be seen as a perpetual Other when you're a minority. But somehow, I want us to skip ahead to the place where the only stories of people of color we get to read aren't about their, you know, color. So when I found that Theresa Romain's Secrets of a Scandalous Heiress had an Anglo-Indian hero, I knew I was heading into a personally sensitive territory as a reader.

Naturally, I knew that in a book set in Regency England a hero who has ""Indian blood"" — even though it's only from one grandparent — would treat this fact as undesirable. And he does. But Joss also yearns for that part of his heritage and finds a way to reconcile his pride in it with being an Englishman. No, don't groan — those of us who straddle cultures live this. It's just not our whole life. And it isn't Joss's either, thank heavens! His more immediate concern is trying to free himself of his dependency on a self-destructive, entitled relative who is also his employer. Toward this goal, he strikes up a deal with Augusta, an heiress who's posing as someone she isn't, because she believes that society sees her as worthless on account of her working class origins.

Heated Moments by Phyllis Bourne Paperback, 218 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Romain uses wit and wisdom to orchestrate the sweet build of friendship and trust between these two damaged characters, who aren't damaged in a ravaged sort of way, but in a more real life sort of way, the way everyday nicks lead to deeper cuts. And it deepens our satisfaction when they find a way to reconcile not just their attraction but their struggles with economic inequality, upward mobility, and self-worth. Plus, Romain manages to paint a sense of place so vivid, you will crave a trip to Bath.

In contrast, Phyllis Bourne's Heated Moments pays absolutely no heed to race. If this book weren't published under Harlequin's African-American centered Kimani line, I'd neither know nor care about the race of the characters, which in itself is so great it makes me want to dance a jig— but it also makes me want to strip away publisher lines delineated by race. Because seriously, anyone who enjoys old school category romance will delight in this: Misunderstood and well-meaning poor little rich girl meets stand-up, small-town police chief, and sparks fly. I'll admit to having laughed out loud a few times at Bourne's screwball antics, which called to mind the situational mix-ups of P.G. Wodehouse crossed with the most exuberantly slapstick Bollywood rom-coms.

Forget Tomorrow by Pintip Dunn Hardcover, 336 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Pintip Dunn's dystopian young adult fantasy Forget Tomorrow also has a half-Asian heroine, whose race Dunn refers to precisely once in the entire book. She focuses instead on a beautiful story; her writing is so insightful and freshly delicate it's like the incipient wisdom of children. Callie has been waiting to receive a memory from her future self on her 17th birthday so she can start living her life toward the memory the way everyone in her world does. Instead, she sees herself kill her beloved sister, and ends up imprisoned and awaiting a crime she is yet to commit. Her only hope is the help of her estranged friend, a boy who has let secrets destroy their friendship.

The plot twists and turns organically and wraps you up like tangled sheets, until you're struggling with your reading speed to find out what happens next. Living in the moment and not getting lost in your future is a theme that resonates with me especially — perhaps because I come from a culture preoccupied with fortune tellers and horoscopes — and I loved how Dunn addresses the free will versus destiny debate.

Let It Shine by Alyssa Cole Paperback, 134pp | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

The last of the books on my RITA finalists list transcends my color-shouldn't-be-conflict peeve. Alyssa Cole's Let It Shine is set in Virginia in 1961, during the Civil Rights struggle. Sofie is your quintessential good girl who lost her mother young and craves the good opinion of her surviving parent and her close knit community. But from the very first time you meet her, she's a volcano, her spirit and sense of justice warring with all the expectations of propriety she shoulders. Her slow and spectacular explosion into herself is the reason I read books. The deep and immovable bond she feels with Ivan, the white, Jewish childhood friend who shared her life's worst moment — that's the reason I read romances. It's everything that reinforces the belief that we do not get to choose the people we fall in love with, but we do get to choose how hard we fight to claim that love.

Against all odds, Sofie and Ivan recognize the connection that says ""I see you. I see what no one else sees — the real you, the you you want to be."" It's how we all fall in love, and Cole captures it in all its aching glory. This is the kind of book you don't want to end, because it brings up everything worthwhile inside you. It's exactly the kind of book that does skip ahead to a place where nothing but the story matters, but it's also the kind of book that proves how essential representation is, by showing that while human experience transcends race, neutralizing our stories down to only one race strips away their most humanizing and precious components: perspective and voice.

And a quick postscript: I'll be including the fifth RITA finalist book with a racially diverse protagonist, The Nanny Plan, in my next post about the diverse books that actually won RITA awards in 2016.

FARAI CHIDEYA, HOST:

The Hugo Awards are handed out each year for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. They've been awarded since 1955 in categories like best novel and best graphic story. Tonight, author Nnedi Okorafor is up for best novella for her story about a girl named Binti.

NNEDI OKORAFOR: (Reading) I powered up the transporter and said a silent prayer. I had no idea what I was going to do if it didn't work. My transporter was cheap, so even a droplet of moisture or more likely a grain of sand would cause it to short. It was faulty, and most of the time I had to restart it over and over before it worked. Please not now, please not now, I thought.

CHIDEYA: Well, that's one way to head off to college, at least for the title character, Binti. She's a teenager headed to the best university among worlds, some of which are at war with each other. Author Nnedi Okorafor joins us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. Welcome.

OKORAFOR: Thank you. Glad to be here.

CHIDEYA: So how did you come up with this character, who has many fascinating talents we'll get into, and this world?

OKORAFOR: It's interesting because a lot of my stories are often based on several things, but their foundation is in the stories of the women and girls around me and also within myself. And Binti comes from a very insular family - a cultural family that's very close. And she ends up picking up and going and leaving her family and going just so that she can go to a university that is on another planet.

And the way that that kind of came along was, for me at the time, I had decided to take a position at the University of Buffalo in New York. They were having a bit of a hard time with it, and it was a decision that I had made. And it was a very, very big decision, and eventually I had to just do it. I had to just go. The first few months I was there, that was when I wrote ""Binti,"" and I was kind of exploring my family's fears and a lot of their fears were logical. And I was exploring them, and I was thinking what if the fears that they had of me leaving and doing this really just kind of breaking from the family in this way - what if their fears came true? And that's where the plot of ""Binti"" came from.

CHIDEYA: And you're the American-born child of Igbo parents from Nigeria, and that ethnic group has tens of millions of people in the most populous country on the continent of Africa. So how has that heritage affected your world view?

OKORAFOR: I call myself Nigamerican (ph) as opposed to Nigerian-American because Nigamerican is one word. That's very much a part of my identity, and it's also very much a reason why I think I ended up writing science fiction and fantasy because I live on these borders - and these borders that allow me to see from multiple perspectives and kind of take things in and then kind of process certain ideas and certain stories in a very unique way. And that has led me to write this strange fiction that I write, which really isn't that strange if you really look at it through a sort of skewed lens.

CHIDEYA: And a lot of your work includes African characters and just a diverse cast of characters. The award for which you're nominated, the Hugo Award, has been rocked by controversy in recent years with a group of writers sometimes calling themselves the Sad Puppies or the Rabid Puppies, voting as a block against what they argue is boring, multicultural message fiction. Why do you think there's so much pushback against multicultural science fiction and speculative fiction?

OKORAFOR: When people see something that is new to them, you know, new or different or that's so new that they don't quite understand it and so therefore can't analyze it from an easy point of view, the result is often fear. And fear often manifests itself as anger and rage and hatred, and I think that's where a lot of this comes from.

I think that inevitably science fiction and fantasy was going to become more diverse, and I think that certain people kind of react negatively to that because they've been used to being in a certain position for so long. And they feel that they're being moved from the center and becoming less significant when really that is not what's happening at all. Things are just becoming bigger and more exciting, and they're included as well. So I think that it's fear of the unknown. I think these are the last throes of that shift. It's - these are growing pains.

CHIDEYA: How does it fit into your overall writer's mission, however you define that for yourself, to have books not only for adults but children that are in the speculative-fiction genre, you know, things like your ""Akata Witch"" series? Tell us a little bit about that story and also how it fits into your view of what science fiction and speculative fiction and fantasy are?

OKORAFOR: OK. I'll start with ""Akata Witch."" ""Akata Witch"" is a story that is about a Nigerian-American girl who goes back to Nigeria and is dealing with all of her cultural issues, and then one day she finds out she's part of this magical society. She meets friends, and there's a community. And then there's a magical world. Basically, her world just really opens up because it becomes more.

As far as my own mission, I wouldn't say that I have a mission. I know that I was writing these stories because, one, I enjoyed writing stories. Two, I had all of these stories to tell. Like, I'd look around at my relatives, and I listened. And I wasn't seeing these stories that I wanted to see being told. It's not so much a mission. It's just that I love stories, and so I write them and so I produce them.

CHIDEYA: Nnedi Okorafor is an award-winning author. Her book ""Binti"" is up for best novella at the Hugo Science Fiction Awards tonight. Thanks so much for joining us, Nnedi.

OKORAFOR: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Editor's note: This interview contains adult themes, including a discussion of sexual assault.

Amy Schumer is tired of answering a question journalists ask her all the time: Is this a good moment for women in Hollywood?

""It is an amazing moment for every woman,"" she tells NPR's David Greene, ""if you have ovaries and you're in the 90210 ZIP code.""

One reason Schumer hates that question: She's a New Yorker. The other? She thinks women generally have it tough all the time. And speaking up — about sex, gender stereotypes, crazy, unrealistic expectations for women and their appearance — is a signature of her comedy.

Schumer was already a comedy star the last time she spoke to NPR a few years ago. Then, last year, Trainwreck — the movie she wrote and starred in, somewhat inspired by her own life — was a hit. And she got really famous.

Now, she's written a memoir, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo (and, yes, she has one).

Like her comedy, the book is revealing. She shares excerpts from her personal diaries going back to her preteen years, complete with footnotes from present-day Amy (young Amy dreamed of living in New York and making money acting and bartending, all of which she's done).

Schumer says she always knew she was funny. ""I only remember loving making people laugh. And making myself laugh.""

Interview Highlights

On being a comedian and an introvert

I think standup is pretty good for an introvert, because you are performing, but, I mean, it's on your own terms. There are so many people in the room, but it's a one-sided conversation. And you actually don't have to interact, unless you want to. ... I don't want to pull the curtain back, but comedians do want laughs. That is the goal. Being introverted, it doesn't mean necessarily being shy or being afraid of public speaking, it just means that it's hard for me to interact with people for too long.

On writing about being sexually assaulted (Schumer says she had fallen asleep and woke to find her boyfriend having sex with her without her consent)

Talking about this in the book, it's a lot and it's risky, and then people say, ""You didn't use the word rape."" People ... they just want a pull quote. They want clickbait. And so just talking about being sexually assaulted in any way, you know, for women, it's never like, ""Oh, I'm really sorry that happened to you."" Which is really how it should be, and how you would think it would be. But it's more, we look for problems we have with how that woman has spoken about her sexual assault.

I feel like there won't be enough change ... until there's no wage gap, and until someone says 'You're my favorite comic,' not 'You're my favorite female comic.'

I call it ""grape,"" because it's this gray area. Not of whether or not it was rape, but it's not the way we think of, like, a Law and Order episode. And when it's not as black and white for everyone, it makes it harder for them to digest. So it's this very personal thing to me, that I decided to share. And I'm only looking for people to feel less alone reading it, and maybe for a guy to read it and think, ""Oh."" Maybe that'll stop somebody in their tracks, I don't know.

On whether the world has changed for female comedians in the past few years

Not enough. Things are being talked about more than they used to be, things like the wage gap. ... I do talk about sex because I do think that a lot of things translate from the bedroom into how you live your everyday life. Like, as a woman, I think that a lot of women are in relationships where they're with someone who doesn't make sure that they orgasm. And the woman doesn't make it important ... and I think that translates to the office, where you should demand to be spoken to and treated equally to men. I feel like there won't be enough change ... until there's no wage gap, and until someone says ""You're my favorite comic,"" not ""You're my favorite female comic."""

This is already happening, but it’s important not to forget that as we line up experts for two-ways and interviews about public policy issues, we need to know if they’re connected to or publicly support one of the presidential campaigns. A standard question these days should be something like “are you advising any of the campaigns?” Or, “have you been called by any of the campaigns or candidates?” Or, “are you publicly supporting one of the candidates?”

Check with them about connections to public policy groups and advocacy organizations as well.

We look for expertise on a wide variety of subjects that are campaign issues. They include climate change, criminal justice, economics, foreign affairs, immigration, national security and tax policy. The list could go on.

A “yes” response to one of our questions doesn’t automatically disqualify someone, but it is information we need to know, weigh and tell our listeners and readers if it’s decided that person should be part of our report.

Meanwhile, our responsibility doesn’t end with a “no” response from the expert. Trust, but verify. Do some searches to be sure that person hasn’t shown up in stories about “economists who support Smith” or “historians who are advising Jones.” The expert may have an explanation. After all, campaigns sometimes exaggerate their support and academics sometimes sign on to things without quite realizing what they’ve done.

It’s also important to know whether someone has advised candidates or groups in the past. That information may help put the expert’s thinking in context.

How far down the ballot do we need to go? It’s wise to ask whether they’re connected to any House, Senate or statewide races. We would also want to know if an expert in a particular field has gotten involved in a specific story — the Flint water crisis, for example.

We get several emails a day from folks who want to correct our grammar. Many start like this:

“Would you please inform [insert name of NPR journalist] that to say [insert mistake, often about “lie” or “lay”] is incorrect.” Then they usually question the quality of our educations.

We recently got a warmer wag of a finger. Jarrod Jackson in Audience Relations passed along an actual letter – on paper – from 12-year-old Sylvia Seay of Crozet, Va. She chided us just a bit while also being absolutely charming, at least in the eyes of many in the newsroom.

- Page 1 is here.

- Be sure to open Page 2 as well.

Sylvia is a fan of NPR, but she has an issue:

“I have noticed that you refer to parents as ‘mothers’ and ‘fathers,’ rather than ‘moms’ and ‘dads.’ Despite this, children are still dubbed ‘kids.’ … “I find this improper because the definition for ‘kid’ in Webster’s 7th New Collegiate Dictionary is as follows: ‘A young goat, or various related animals.’ “A child does not fall under this category. I myself am a child in 8th grade and of twelve years. I would suggest another term in place of ‘kid,’ such as: child, youth, younger population, teen, minor, or whippersnapper (haha).”

A search of NPR.org turns up about 1,300 mentions of “kids” in the past year and 1,400 of “children.”

The numbers wouldn’t have been that close, I bet, a few decades ago. I told Sylvia in an email that I remember being admonished by an editor nearly 40 years ago. “Children are not ‘kids,’” he said.

But, I added, “over time, the word has become more accepted.”

Perhaps we can put some of the blame on Madison Avenue. Remember that Armour hot dogs commercial from the ‘60s and ‘70s?

I also told Sylvia that:

“You’ve touched on an issue we deal with every day. We want to be careful with our words and we try not to make grammatical mistakes. But we also want to be conversational and ‘sound like America.’ English is a living language and we change with the times. That said … ‘kids’ is a word that works better in fun, or lighter, stories. A guideline might be that if you wouldn’t use the words ‘mom’ and ‘dad,’ then ‘kids’ probably isn’t appropriate either.”

Now, if only more of our language police were like Sylvia. She’s a good … person.

Kadohata is the Newbery Medal-winning author of the YA novel ""Kira-Kira."" For our ""Next Chapter"" series, she talks about an eye-opening bus trip she took across the U.S. right before she left home.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Do you remember the moment when you left home for good? This month, many young people will be experiencing that moment as they shoulder their bags and head off to college. And throughout August, we're bringing you stories and advice about that pivotal moment from authors who've written for young adults. It's a series we call Next Chapter. Today, we hear from Cynthia Kadohata. She's the Newbery Medal-winning author of ""Kira-Kira"" and ""Half A World Away."" And she says the common thread in all her books is that they focus on something that moves her.

CYNTHIA KADOHATA: I love dogs a lot, so I wrote a book called ""Cracker!"" about the dogs who served in Vietnam.

MARTIN: Kadohata was 17 years old when she dropped out of high school. For the next few years, she lived at home in LA and went to community college, then she finished her undergraduate degree at a four-year university. She was in her 20s when she decided she wanted to leave home and start a new life in Boston. The year was 1981.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""BADLANDS"")

KADOHATA: I had taken a month-long bus trip - Greyhound bus trip shortly before I left Los Angeles. And I really saw the country as I had never seen it before.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BADLANDS"")

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Lights out tonight, trouble in the heartland, got a head-on collision smashing in my guts, man. I'm caught in...

KADOHATA: For me, going on this bus trip was one of the real pivotal times in my life. I met people who I never would have ordinarily met. I was on a bus with a woman in her 80s who said she was dying, and this was going to be her last trip that she would ever take. She had lived in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl years and gone to California to pick fruit. And I was just fascinated by her life. We talked for hours on the bus, and she hugged me afterwards. I remember we were standing in, I think it was Texas somewhere, and they were grasshoppers hopping all over the parking lot. And she hugged me and told me to have a good life.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT"")

KADOHATA: And just meeting her somehow changed my whole vision of America, I think. I mean, I had always lived in America. But I didn't have an awareness, really, of being an American so much as I did when I talked to these people. And I saw that each person has their own story which is unique and incredibly valuable to hear about. And that was when I started to think that I wanted to be a writer.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

KADOHATA: You should find whatever it is you feel passionate about, and find people who inspire you, who will mentor you and help you through whatever decisions you have to make.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Well they're still racing out at the trestles. But that blood, it never burned in her veins.

MARTIN: That's Cynthia Kadohata. We've been hearing music from Bruce Springsteen's ""Darkness On The Edge of Town,"" an album Kadahota says was very important to her when she left home. She is part of our series Next Chapter.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Well, if she wants to see me, you can tell her that I'm easily found. Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge. Tell her there's a darkness on the edge of town. There's a darkness on the edge of town.

Well, everybody's got a secret, son - something that they just can't face...

Maybe Not",[],"[u'bleeped', u'weve', u'word', u'dont', u'language', u'maybe', u'warn', u'listeners', u'need', u'heads', u'piece', u'gethard']","If We’ve Bleeped It, Do We Also Need To Warn Listeners? Maybe Not

Is it necessary to alert listeners that there’s offensive/disturbing/troubling/etc. language in a report if we’ve already bleeped the nettlesome word or words?

The short answer is, “not always.”

Previous guidance has been too strict on this point. Let’s try this:

If it’s been decided after discussions with senior editors that a word or phrase will be bleeped, don’t assume listeners do or do not need to be alerted. Instead, consider the context.

– Is the cut still intense, graphic or disturbing even after it’s been bleeped? Then a heads up for listeners could be warranted. By the way, it may not have to be a line that sounds like a warning. The language can be conversational and informational (more on that below).

– Is the cut funny and a naughty word or two are said in jest? Then a heads up probably isn’t necessary.

– Is it one bleep in an otherwise family-friendly piece and the word wasn’t said in anger? Then, again, there could be no need for a heads up.

Basically, it’s a judgment call. Talk to the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and/or the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott). It will get figured out.

Two related notes:

– Here’s the part about being conversational and informational. If we think listeners should be alerted, we don’t always need to say something like “we should warn you.” On Morning Edition recently, there was a piece about the comic Chris Gethard. Two F-bombs were bleeped. In the introduction, David Greene said of Gethard that, “Chris is funny and weird. But he doesn’t shock audiences. You’ll only hear a couple of bleeps this morning.” That told listeners something about Gethard and tipped them off to what was coming without saying they needed to be on guard.

– Any time there’s bleeped language in a piece, the DACS line must tell stations what that word is, when it appears (or approximately if we’re still editing) and that it will be bleeped. Obviously, on the occasions when we don’t bleep offensive language, the DACS need to explain that.

NPR’s “Policy On Use Of Potentially Offensive Language” is posted here.

We hadn’t heard a presidential candidate call an opponent a “sniveling coward” until yesterday. But there it was, in newscasts and on NPR.org. Add it to the many things we hadn’t heard before this campaign.

Language lovers may be wondering:

Has that phrase or just the word “sniveling” been heard on NPR before?

A search of our transcripts, which go back to 1990, turns up two examples of the specific phrase.

- A 1991 piece from Sylvia Poggioli in which Croatian soldiers and “Serb insurgents” are heard trading insults on their walkie-talkies. “You’re a sniveling coward,” one Croatian called his enemy. (Google Translate tells us that in Croatian it would be “sniveling kukavica.”)

- A 1995 report by John Burnett about closing arguments in the trial of 11 Branch Davidians. The U.S. attorney said one of the defendants was a “sniveling coward” for firing at law officers from a place where there were children hiding.

“Sniveling” or “snivelling” turn up in transcripts 39 times. The closest example to this week’s usage is from 1992 when Mary Matalin, political director of President George H.W. Bush’s re-election campaign, said Bill Clinton’s campaign was full of “sniveling hypocrites.” She later apologized. She also later married Clinton campaign strategist James Carville.

A search of NPR.org turns up 16 examples of “sniveling” or “snivelling.”

Where does the word “snivel” come from?

- Oxford Dictionaries says “Late Old English (recorded only in the verbal noun snyflung ‘mucus’), from snofl, in the same sense; compare with snuffle.”

- Webster’s says “[Middle English] snivlen < [Old English] snyflan < base seen in snofl, mucus.”

What does “snivel” mean?

- In the context put forward this week, it is “to fret or complain in a whining, tearful manner … to make a whining, tearful, often false display of grief, sympathy, disappointment, etc.” (Webster’s)

Did Shakespeare ever use the word?

- Shakespeare search engines indicate the answer is no. But here’s one highfalutin place it shows up: In playwright Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, Abigail Williams calls Elizabeth “Goody” Proctor “a lying, cold, sniveling woman.”

Why is this post attached to the NPR Ethics Handbook?

- As you’ve hopefully figured out the past two years, “Memmos” aren’t always about ethical issues. Sometimes we just have a few minutes to spare during lunch and start poking around.

Mike Pence sat down in Henry Jones' barbershop in Norristown, Pa., Tuesday, during a campaign swing — and the media came along for the ride.

CNN streamed 20 minutes of silence and small talk on Facebook Live, as Pence got a trim. Watch it here:

Among the moments captured on camera:

Pence: You've been at this location since '92?

Jones: Yes

Pence: It's a good location

After looking in a mirror and proclaiming it a ""great haircut — perfect,"" Pence applauded, then walked behind the chair to shake Jones' hand.

And this happened.

""Your name was —?"" Jones asked.

This barber throws some serious shade @Mike_Pence after his haircut. ""What was your name again?"" https://t.co/ekinmsZCyT — Matthew Ellis (@MatthewIN317) August 23, 2016

Pence replied, ""Mike Pence. I'm the governor of Indiana, and I'm running for vice president of the United States.""

This fact seemed to take Jones by surprise. ""Go ahead, man,"" he said. ""Vice president? Oh boy.""

""I'm running with Donald Trump. I'm his running mate,"" Pence said.""

""OK. All right. Oh boy.""

With Trump trying to reach out to the black community, the moment instantly set Twitter alight.

On Monday, Pence struggled when a Fox reporter asked him Monday about Trump's contention that in 2020, he would win 95 percent of the African-American vote. Pence laughed; the reporters asked why he was laughing.

""Well, that's Donald Trump,"" he said."

Guitarist, actor, writer (and former Monitor Mix blogger) Carrie Brownstein joins us, along with NPR Music's Stephen Thompson, to do something we don't normally do: Talk about the songs we really, really don't like.

Our mission at All Songs is to bring you our favorite musical discoveries of the week. But after Stephen wrote his Good Listener column examining Starship's widely reviled hit single ""We Built This City,"" we watched the comments pour in like an out-of-control fire hose, and got to talking about all the songs that drive us bonkers. It was so much fun we decided to continue the discussion here, with a look at some of the contenders for worst songs of all time, and why they stick in our craw. These are the relentless earworms — the songs you can't escape once they're in your head — or the annoying novelty songs. ""The Candy Man,"" anyone? We also look at songs that take themselves too seriously, songs we used to love until they were ruined by a bad personal experience and more.

We said this week that a man was “mentally retarded.”

“Retarded” is not a word we use to describe anyone. It’s among the “words that hurt.”

Joe Shapiro, who has done a lot of reporting and thinking about this, suggests phrases such as “intellectual disability” or “developmentally disabled” and that they be used with a “people first” approach. That is, put the person before the condition. Say “a man with an intellectual disability” rather than “a mentally retarded man.”

If you can’t seem to avoid a label, the AP recommends “mentally disabled,” “intellectually disabled” or “developmentally disabled.” But those aren’t great alternatives, as is often the case with labels.

As for labels, reminders are in order:

No. 1: “It is generally best to avoid labeling people, especially with terms that partisans have chosen.” Use “action words” to describe people rather than pinning them with labels.

No. 2: It’s certainly almost always best “to avoid labeling people who have medical conditions.” As we’ve written before, “it’s better to say someone ‘has been diagnosed with schizophrenia’ rather than ‘is a schizophrenic.’ Or, ‘she is being treated for anorexia’ rather than ‘she is an anorexic.’ Or, ‘he is diabetic,’ instead of ‘he is a diabetic.’ ”

No. 3: Pay particularly close attention to the way you refer to people who have gone through traumatic experiences. We’ve previously discussed the language regarding survivors of sexual assault.

This isn’t about political correctness. It’s about respect for those we report about (and “Respect” is one of our core principles) and it’s about accuracy (another core principle).

If they're PWR BTTM, armed with confetti cannons, glitter and a blasting rock song of lost love, the answer is: Of course they can.

PWR BTTM is a loud, lovable duo from New York with its high-heels planted firmly in The Ramones school of rock. Ben Hopkins and Liv Bruce trade off singing, drumming and guitar — sometimes within a single song. Both Ben and Liv wrote to tell me their thoughts on the song and though their comments aren't in conflict, each one's relationship to the song feels a little different. Liv said, ""What if you threw a party and no one came? What if your friends were all at the beach and you were at the DMV? What if your crush never texted back? Maybe all you can do is focus on what you like about yourself and try to have a good time alone. This video is about taking authorship of your life, even if you can't fully control which characters stick around.""

The video was shot in an abandoned waterpark in the Mojave Desert, which connects to Ben's thought on the song, that it's about exploring nostalgia and ""unpacking how even something as complicated as a relationship between two people can be boiled down to one place or memory, so setting those feelings at a place that's frozen in the past felt like a logical fit. Plus, it was colorful.""

Director H.S. Naji ties all these ideas together. ""I planned for the term 'revisiting desolation' to be the crux of the video,"" he wrote to me. ""The location plays as all those broken promises, false hopes and crushed hearts everyone experiences. We see these two personas walk through that familiar cemetery of attractions — and at least make do with pool paraphernalia and glitter.""

The video ends with a faux film rating — Q for Queer — and a note that it may cause hot flashes and boy sweats. Consider yourself warned.

PWR BTTM's under-30-minute debut album, Ugly Cherries, released in 2015, is at the top of the list of my most-listened-to records of 2016, and the band, on tour now with Ra Ra Riot and SUN CLUB, is a blast of glittery fun live. Go get GLTTRD!"

Firefighters have reached full containment of a blaze east of Los Angeles that forced tens of thousands to evacuate their homes. At the same time, multiple wildfires continued to challenge crews throughout the state.

California's Department of Forestry and Fire Information declared the Blue Cut Fire 100 percent contained Tuesday — but not before the 36,000-acre fire destroyed nearly 100 homes and forced the evacuation of 80,000 people in San Bernardino County.

By Saturday, crews had largely contained the blaze, allowing the lifting of evacuation orders for many residents. NPR's Nathan Rott tells our Newscast unit that more than 300 crews were pulled off the fire as it dwindled.

""Attention is turning from that fire ... toward others,"" Nathan says.

Statewide, 10,000 fire personnel are battling six major wildfires, including the Chimney Fire, which is burning in San Luis Obispo County.

That inferno has already consumed 53 structures and 37,101 acres in Central California near the Hearst Castle, built by publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, now a tourist attraction.

On Saturday, the California Parks Department announced the property's closure owing to poor air quality. It remains closed through the week.

Nearly 4,000 fire personnel are working on that fire, which is considered 35 percent contained.

In Northern California, the long-burning Soberanes Fire is 60 percent contained. The fire has been burning for a month and has consumed some 87,000 acres north of Big Sur. At least one death has been attributed to the blaze.

And just west of Los Angeles, the Rey Fire is burning through wilderness in Santa Barbara County. So far, 27,000 acres have burned. The fire is 30 percent contained."

Well, the secret's out on the Austin band whose members composed the epic score for the Netflix original series Stranger Things — but producing horror-score-influenced compositions is nothing new for S U R V I V E. For almost a decade, the band has explored these sounds with drum machines and analog synths. Now, it's preparing to release its second full-length record, RR7349, this September.

""Wardenclyffe"" is a slow-mo synth chugger that would be as effective in your local cinema during a Halloween double feature as it would on the dance floor in your local discotheque. The standout track, like much of S U R V I V E's music, gives nods to John Carpenter and Goblin with its space-age synthesizers and tension-inducing, rolling bass. Still, the band's composition of these sounds is truly something unique.

""Wardenclyffe"" begins with a 4/4 kick, a distorted snare figure and a simple, yet effective, driving synth bass. As the track continues, the band introduces some of the sci-fi ambience characteristic of the Stranger Things score, and the bass line transforms into arpeggios. These ominous progressions continue as the track's tension builds; meanwhile, further melodic layers are introduced, slowly shining a light and generating a sense of hope in the darkness. A break in the drums and a modulating, cosmic synth pad pave the way to a cinematic crescendo that could soundtrack the heroic ending of your favorite sci-fi horror film or your most euphoric, hands-in-the-air moment in the club.

RR7349 comes out Sept. 30 on Relapse."

A look back at our coverage of what happened to Illinois police Lt. Charles Gliniewicz, who authorities now say killed himself, highlights the importance of attributing information and not getting ahead of ourselves when stories are breaking and investigations are under way.

Here are lines from five stories we aired or posted in the first few days after the news broke:

– Gliniewicz “was shot to death in the line of duty on Tuesday — while chasing three suspects on foot.”

– “Investigators acknowledge they still only have vague descriptions of the three men Fox Lake police officer Charles Joseph Gliniewicz was trying to apprehend when he was shot and killed Tuesday morning.”

– “Lt. Gliniewicz was pursuing those suspects–two white men and a black man– on foot when he lost radio contact with a dispatcher.”

– ”Before he was shot and killed Tuesday morning, Lt Charles Joseph Gliniewicz told dispatchers he was pursing three suspicious men on foot — two of them white and the third, black.”

– “The officer radioed to dispatchers that he was going to check on suspicious activity around 8 a.m. local time in the community of Fox Lake, Lake County sheriff’s office spokesman Christopher Covelli said at a news conference. The officer, who has not yet been identified, then said he was in a ‘foot pursuit,’ before losing contact. Covelli said responding officers arrived and found the officer injured from a gunshot wound and without his service weapon. The officer died at the scene.”

The first three examples flatly say that Gliniewicz was chasing suspects when he was shot. The last two examples make it clear that Gliniewicz said he was in pursuit of three suspects.

Examples 1-3 skipped a key fact — that it was Gliniewicz who reported he was chasing three suspects. He was the source for that information. He was a single source. In hindsight, the attribution was critical.

Two other phrases in our early reports are interesting to think about now: “Shot to death” and “shot and killed.” Gliniewicz was shot. He did die. However, those phrases make it sound as if someone else did the shooting. If we had known he took his own life, we wouldn’t have used them. We couldn’t have known that, of course. But there’s a case to be made that we should have thought through the possibilities and said “before he was shot and died” or some other phrasing that didn’t include the word “killed.”

Jimmy LaValle hasn't always been this quiet. Before launching the hushed solo ambient project The Album Leaf in 1999, the native San Diegan made chaotic noise in a handful of experimental hardcore bands, most notably Swing Kids, The Crimson Curse and The Locust. He turned toward more contemplative sounds with the post-rock group Tristeza, which he co-founded in 1997 (and left in 2003). But it's his solo effort that's brought LaValle the most attention and acclaim. Starting with 1999's An Orchestrated Rise To Fall, The Album Leaf has slowly grown into a rapturously meditative act, capable of zero-gravity drift and sky-scraping melody.

Between Waves — The Album Leaf's sixth full-length album, and its first since 2010's A Chorus Of Storytellers — deepens and strengthens LaValle's way with whispers, minimalism and intimacy. Predominantly instrumental, the record draws from the krautrock tradition of groups like Cluster, all synthesized bursts and futuristic sleekness. But in ""False Dawn,"" the alienating sound is brought down to earth: Lush and lumbering, it's punctuated with brass-like fanfares and skittering beats. ""Back To The Start"" injects vintage synth-pop into the formula, even as it toys with off-kilter time signatures and a droning sense of melancholy. And in ""Lost In The Fog,"" LaValle gets abstract, favoring huge yet languid drums underneath glitchy blips and the sudden, almost unsettling warmth of jangly guitars.

LaValle doesn't sing often, but when he does, it's arresting. He doesn't come into ""New Soul"" until the track is halfway over; when his voice wanders in, its singsong wistfulness brings a lonely dimension to the already-downbeat excursion. ""Never Far"" and ""Between The Waves"" feature full vocals throughout, and as such, they're the closest thing to potential hits on the album. But even when they're sweetened and humanized by LaValle's dreamy croon, there's cinematic sprawl to these songs — an evocation of drama, loss and fraught emotional atmosphere, all without tipping overboard.

Even with the back-and-forth between vocal tracks and instrumentals, the album doesn't hold a lot of peaks or valleys. ""Take my breath / Between waves,"" LaValle chants sleepily across the title track's refrain. Like the tide, the record swells from one state to the next, building and dissipating in sequences of soft pulses and washes of blissful oblivion. The mood may shift — sometimes shadowy and pensive, sometimes luminous and euphoric — but Between Waves gently maintains its persistent, consuming lull."

Night of the Animals by Bill Broun Hardcover, 543 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

It took Bill Broun 14 years to write Night of the Animals. But the novel, Broun's debut, has still proved remarkably timely in a summer of ""Brexit""-tinged anxieties.

The book depicts a dark future in which the European Union has dissolved and the U.K. has become a pacified surveillance state. Between ""indigents"" and ""the new aristocracy,"" a vanishing middle class bows beneath abundant chocolate, lager, legal hallucinogens and mind-numbing electronics.

In the middle of it all, the London Zoo stands as a kind of ark for all the non-human species who are being driven out of existence. And Cuthbert, the character at the heart of the narrative, can hear them clamoring to get out.

""He actually hears the animals asking to be released,"" Broun, a professor at East Stroudsburg State University, tells NPR's Scott Simon. ""And he understands that releasing them is actually something that is bigger than simply releasing animals from the zoo. It's a kind of fulcrum between the old world and a kind of liberating cataclysm.""

Interview Highlights

On the world he has created: London in 2052

There is a newly empowered monarchy, and a lot of the important Victorian reforms that put that monarchy into check have been reversed, so that there's a fictionalized King Henry, who's a fictionalized version of the current Prince Harry, turned into a tyrant. Britain has become ultra-nationalistic and powerful, too.

On the inspirations for his main character, Cuthbert

I lived in the 1990s in Houston, Texas, and for complicated reasons I ended up making friends with a lot of men who were schizophrenic, who had sometimes been on the streets, who sometimes were in kind of shaky housing situations.

And I had my own struggles with psychosis occasionally and anxiety disorder. Indeed, I turned to alcohol as a way of coping. One of the things that I had found with these men is that they had all done the same thing. They were essentially self-medicating, and when they weren't taking their medication, they would kind of go off the rails. But I was fascinated by their imaginations and their creativity.

I really felt that I was searching for God as I was writing this book.

One of these people is a man I grew very close to, and I'm still friends with him today. I actually took him to the zoo, and I saw him talking to the howler monkeys in this just incredibly tender-hearted voice. Then I started thinking about all the different ways people have talked to animals and heard them talk back — in everything from Christian hagiography to children's stories. So I just really became fascinated by the idea of bringing to life a man who could speak to animals and hear them, too.

On the kinds of traps we confront — but real and metaphorical

I'm trying to make a comment on different kinds of entrapment. I thought about the different ways that people are trapped — you know, trapped in a kind of grief.

For Cuthbert, you know, he had lost his brother at a young age, and he mourns for this brother. And he believes — this is the other thing — he believes that by releasing these animals, there's a possibility of finding his brother, who is presented as lost and possibly dead. And that grief that he has, that need to find his brother, I think that's one of the big motivating factors for him.

On what it was like to live with the themes, the characters, this world for the 14 years he spent writing the novel

For me, I know if might sound hokey, but it was kind of a spiritual journey for me. I really felt that I was searching for God as I was writing this book. And Cuthbert in the novel, his savior in some ways is a stranger who happens to be a woman who's a police officer. I believe that God works through people — and animals, too."

The VCR is officially going the way of the Betamax and LaserDisc: into the technology graveyard.

Funai Electric, a Japanese electronics company that may be the last VCR-maker in the world, announced that it will shut down its VCR production lines in August. It ""has been producing VHS-playing VCRs for 33 years, most recently in China for Sanyo,"" the BBC says.

The company at one time sold 15 million of its videocassette recorder systems a year, ArsTechnica reports, but in 2015 moved only 750,000.

Of course, most of us probably thought the VCR was already long gone; after all, Variety magazine published an obituary for the VHS tape a decade ago:

'Variety' Publishes Obituary for the VHS Tape Listen

""After a long illness, the groundbreaking home-entertainment format VHS has died of natural causes in the United States. The format was 30 years old. ""No services are planned.""

That postmortem ran in 2006, after film studios stopped producing movies on VHS in favor of the DVD. Actually, the death of the VCR has been a pretty common refrain over the past few years. With the ubiquity of online streaming and on-demand video, however, obituaries for the DVD and Blu-ray may not be so far away.

When Technology Bets Fail Listen · 5:28 5:28

The VCR and VHS (video home system) tapes first premiered on the mass market in the 1970s. In the 1980s, it gave the LaserDisc and Betamax players a run for their money as a cheaper, lighter, and longer-playing alternative for home viewings. The LaserDisc — a high-quality vinyl disc — stopped seeing new titles around 2000, and the last player came out in 2009. Sony finally ceased production of Betamax recorders in 2002 and the tapes this spring.

Both the VHS and Betamax formats became popular as a way to record movies and television on your own — before DVRs existed, if you can imagine such a time. A lawsuit between Sony and Universal and Disney studios made it all the way to the Supreme Court in 1984, racking up a win for home recording.

YouTube

In fact, it's been a slow decline for VHS. Distribution Video and Audio, in Burbank, Calif., stopped buying and selling the tapes in 2008. Panasonic, which started selling VCRs in 1977, stopped making them in 2012.

The tapes might not disappear for a while, though. They still hold on in some smaller video rental stores (RIP), thrift stores, home collections, schools, libraries, and among immigrants, too. After all, some programs are still only available on VHS, and converting the tapes to DVD takes time and effort.

That's not even to mention the collectors and fans for whom VHS — like other outdated tech — will always be seen with a sense of nostalgia.

All Tech Considered wants to know: Do you still use a VCR in your home? And which VHS tapes do you still hold dear? (Ahem: The Princess Bride.)

WHAT, you might ask, is Anna Karenina doing on the same summer reading list as The Little Engine That Could?

Let me explain.

In previous summers, we gave you lists and lists and lists of new books organized by genre. And that was fun. But this summer we wanted to try something different.

Back in December, when we worked on the year-end 2013 Best Books Concierge, one of the things we enjoyed most was finding common threads in very different books (just look at the unlikely titles that live together under the ""Funny Stuff"" category, or the ""Family Matters"" category). And that's how we ended up settling on this year's Book Your Trip project — a series that is much more about the journey than the destination, and aims to create a surprising, serendipitous book discovery experience for the summer months.

In March, the NPR Books team — Petra Mayer, Nicole Cohen, Rose Friedman and myself — reached out to our trusted reviewers, librarians and Arts Desk colleagues and asked them to brainstorm books that featured themes or memorable scenes of transportation and transit. As usual, they wrote back with hundreds of titles — both old and new. We spent the next month or so sorting those books — recommended by Lynn Neary, Michele Norris, Nancy Pearl, Maureen Corrigan, Neda Ulaby and many more. (You can hear Petra talk more about that process with Linda Wertheimer in the audio at the top of this page.)

Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call 'time' a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in 'The Incredible Journey' qualify for the 'by foot' list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with 'James and the Giant Peach'? (Create a big 'miscellaneous' list, obviously.)

There were some pretty straightforward categories — train, plane, bike, boat ... but it didn't take long for things to get squirrelly. Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call ""time"" a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in The Incredible Journey qualify for the ""by foot"" list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with James and the Giant Peach? (Create a big ""miscellaneous"" list, obviously.)

It wasn't always pretty, but eventually we settled on 12 lists: train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time and a miscellaneous category that includes drugs, dragons and giant peaches. (A moment of silence here for a fun list called ""Connections"" that included books featuring multiple modes of transit — like Nellie Bly's Around the World in Seventy-Two Days. Things were just getting too unwieldy, and it didn't make the cut.)

Speaking of things that didn't make the cut: These lists are not comprehensive. They aren't even a little comprehensive. Months before we pressed publish, we were bracing ourselves for the inevitable: NPR, HOW DARE YOU PUBLISH A LIST OF HORSE BOOKS AND NOT INCLUDE [INSERT NAME OF FAVORITE HORSE BOOK HERE] — I'LL NEVER DONATE ANOTHER DIME!!

Honestly, these lists could have gone on forever. We had to stop somewhere. So please don't stop supporting your local member station because Misty of Chincoteague didn't make it. (If you must know: It's because we decided it was about horses, but not horses as a mode of transit). We tried to select an idiosyncratic mix of old and new, known and unknown, and books for new and experienced readers alike. The point is book discovery, so we didn't always pick obvious books; we hope browsing this series feels like wandering into an unfamiliar section of the library.

On the car list, you'll find 'Go, Dog, Go!' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.' And — perhaps for the first time ever — Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with 'The Motorcycle Diaries' and 'The Mouse and the Motorcycle.'

Our favorite thing about these lists is the surprising and funny combinations you get when you decide to look at a very specific slice of something. We love that Anna Karenina and The Little Engine That Could are side by side. On the car list, you'll find Go, Dog. Go! and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And — perhaps for the first time ever — Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with The Motorcycle Diaries and The Mouse and the Motorcycle.

Is this a useful way to organize books? We're not really sure. But it was a fun and interesting exercise, and it made us all add a bunch of new titles to our own reading lists. We hope you'll find some books that are new to you as well. Stay tuned in the coming months — our friends on the Arts Desk will be bringing you Book Your Trip stories on-air. (Bob Mondello has had us tapping our toes to transit-themed show tunes for weeks.)

And of course, outrage aside, we really would like to hear about the books that you would add to the lists. So please share your favorites with us in the comments section of the lists, or tweet them with the hashtag #bookyourtrip.

As always, we know you have a choice when you listen, so we'd like to thank you for choosing NPR Airwaves. You are now free to move about the cabin."

The actor discusses his new film, a return to a genre Bridges knows quite well: the Western. He talks with host Farai Chideya.

FARAI CHIDEYA, HOST:

Jeff Bridges became a cult hero playing The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski,"" but he's made a career in movies set in the American West. He was Rooster Cogburn in the Coen Brothers ""True Grit"" and had an Oscar-winning role in 2009's ""Crazy Heart."" His latest film ""Hell Or High Water"" adds to that, but with a modern twist.

It's a present-day ""Robin Hood"" tale that unfolds across the sprawling plains of West Texas. The story centers on a pair of brothers driven to robbing banks that want to foreclose on their deceased mother's home. Jeff Bridges plays Marcus Hamilton, a career lawman tasked with capturing the brothers for his final assignment.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""HELL OR HIGH WATER"")

GIL BIRMINGHAM: (As Alberto Parker) It's reckless is what it is. It's tweakers, I'm telling you.

JEFF BRIDGES: (As Marcus Hamilton) I don't think these boys is reckless - damn sure ain't tweakers. They know exactly what they're doing.

BIRMINGHAM: (As Alberto Parker) I don't know how you're going to survive without somebody to outsmart. You need a hobby and quick.

BRIDGES: (As Marcus Hamilton) Maybe one of these bank robbers is going to want a gunfight, and I can dodge my retirement in a blaze of glory.

CHIDEYA: Jeff Bridges joins us now from Santa Barbara, Calif. Welcome to the program.

BRIDGES: Oh, thanks for having me.

CHIDEYA: So what drew you to this film?

BRIDGES: Well, it was the old, you know - the reading of the script. It rang so true to me. I felt that the writer, Taylor Sheridan - he must know this world that he's talking about - Texas and lawmen. And I find out after meeting him that his uncle is a marshal down in Texas and that really helped. I got to talk with him and add his authenticity to the whole experience. Also, I mean, you know, after reading the story, the ambiguity really drew me in. You know, this is examining right and wrong, which is not really such a black-and-white issue. It's a pretty gray area.

CHIDEYA: In terms of westerns, you obviously have played the lead role in ""True Grit,"" the Coen Brothers' version. There was a John Wayne version, and there's been a whole arc of westerns throughout American cinema history. And in this film, it's set at a moment in time where people have been hit hard by the economy. There's questions about what gun culture means and how to valorize or not, you know - how weapons are used, so how did you come to think of this western compared to westerns that have come before?

BRIDGES: Yeah. Well, one of the themes to many westerns is the times they are a changing, whether it's here come the automobiles, kicking horses to the curb or, in this sense, banks owning up private property or, you know - you go back to another western that I was involved in - ""Heaven's Gate"" had kind of a similar theme, you know. In those days, it wasn't big oil companies, but it was cattle barons that ruled the land. And this is a story that's always timely.

CHIDEYA: Your foil in the film is the character Toby Howard, played by Chris Pine who's the face of the newest ""Star Trek"" franchise. And Howard has turned to robbing banks in order to help his family. So what was it like working with Pine and how would you describe, for people who haven't seen the film, the dynamic between your two characters?

BRIDGES: Chris was just so wonderful to work with. You know, one of the things that I enjoy so much about what I do is working with actors, and so many of them approach the work kind of like I do. A lot of us go into this situation knowing that we've got a lot of hard work to do. We've got a time element involved, and so we've got to get to be friends so we can relax. And I find that the more relaxed I am, the work can flow through me in a more truthful way.

And so Chris and I approached the work that way. We really, you know, became friends in a fast sort of way. David Mackenzie, our director, did something wonderful to facilitate this camaraderie. Every weekend, he would invite all of us to a cabin in the middle of Albuquerque where they were editing the film. And he would show us an assembly of the work that we had accomplished that week, and we would have a party and just hang out. And we'd, you know, break out our guitars. I - speaking of that, I - you know, my partner in the film - most of my scenes are with Gil Birmingham, who's a wonderful guitarist. And we spent many hours jamming, you know - just playing music is a great way to get together and know each other.

CHIDEYA: Well, you've made a lot of westerns over the course of your career, but you have also played a huge variety of roles, you know, in the cult classic ""Tron,"" The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski."" So answer this - which of the characters that you've played in your career would you most love or hate taking a cross-country road trip with?

BRIDGES: Well, that is a very difficult one. As far as characters I would want to travel with - oh, my gosh. Well, you know, The Dude comes to mind, you know, that'd be sort of like talking to myself, maybe in a way. I don't know. Playing the president - President Jackson - he was kind of an interesting guy. You know, I don't know. I have a fondness for all my characters. I play some pretty evil, you know, bad guys, too. I don't know if I'd want to hang out with those guys too much. But all of them are pretty cool cats. You know, ""The Fabulous Baker Boy"" guy, you know, I could pull over into a little saloon or something. We could do some jamming, get him on the keys. He plays a lot better than I do.

CHIDEYA: Jeff Bridges, we're so glad to speak with you. Thank you so much.

BRIDGES: Nice hanging with you.

CHIDEYA: That's actor Jeff Bridges, and we caught up with him in Santa Barbara, Calif. His new film ""Hell Or High Water"" is out now.

Chapter One

A man runs. Pushes through thin bark-and-leaf walls, through the purposeless rooms of Rudewood. The trees crowd him. This far in the forest there are aboriginal noises. The canopy rocks. The man is heavy-burdened, and sweated by the unseen sun. He is trying to follow a trail.

Just before dark he found his place. Dim hotchi paths led him to a basin ringed by roots and stone-packed soil. Trees gave out. The earth was tramped down and stained with scorching and blood. The man spread out his pack and blanket, a few books and clothes. He laid down something well-wrapped and heavy among loam and centipedes.

Rudewood was cold. The man built a fire, and with it so close the darkness shut him quite out, but he stared into it as if he might see something emergent. Things came close. There were constant bits of sound like the bronchial call of a nightbird or the breath and shucking of some unseen predator. The man was wary. He had pistol and rifle, and one at least was always in his hand.

By flamelight he saw hours pass. Sleep took him and led him away again in little gusts. Each time he woke he breathed as if coming out of water. He was stricken. Sadness and anger went across his face.

""I'll come find you,"" he said.

He did not notice the moment of dawn, only that time skidded again and he could see the edges of the clearing. He moved like he was made of twigs, as if he had stored up the night's damp cold. Chewing on dry meat, he listened to the forest's shuffling and paced the dirt depression.

When finally he heard voices he flattened against the bank and looked out between the trunks. Three people approached on the paths of leaf-mould and forest debris. The man watched them, his rifle steadied. When they trudged into thicker shanks of light, he saw them clearly and let his rifle fall.

""Here,"" he shouted. They dropped foolishly and looked for him. He raised his hand above the earth rise.

They were a woman and two men, dressed in clothes more ill-suited to Rudewood than his own. They stood before him in the arena and smiled. ""Cutter."" They gripped arms and slapped his back.

""I heard you for yards. What if you was followed? Who else is coming?""

They did not know. ""We got your message,"" the smaller man said. He spoke fast and looked about him. ""I went and seen. We were arguing. The others were saying, you know, we should stay. You know what they said.""

""Yeah, Drey. Said I'm mad.""

""Not you.""

They did not look at him. The woman sat, her skirt filling with air. She was breathing fast with anxiety. She bit her nails.

""Thank you. For coming."" They nodded or shook Cutter's gratitude off: it sounded strange to him, and he was sure to them too. He tried not to make it sound like his sardonic norm. ""It means a lot."" * * * They waited in the sunken ground, scratched motifs in the earth or carved figures from dead wood. There was too much to say.

""So they told you not to come?""

The woman, Elsie, told him no, not so much, not in those words, but the Caucus had been dismissive of Cutter's call. She looked up at him and down quickly as she spoke. He nodded, and did not criticise.

""Are you sure about this?"" he said, and would not accept their desultory nods. ""Godsdammit are you sure? Turn your back on the Caucus? You ready to do that? For him? It's a long way we've got to go.""

""We already come miles in Rudewood,"" said Pomeroy.

""There's hundreds more. Hundreds. It'll be bastard hard. A long time. I can't swear we'll come back.""

I can't swear we'll come back.

Pomeroy said, ""Only tell me again your message was true. Tell me again he's gone, and where he's gone and what for. Tell me that's true."" The big man glowered and waited, and at Cutter's brief nod and closed eyes, he said, ""Well then.""

Others arrived then. First another woman, Ihona; and then as they welcomed her they heard stick-litter being destroyed in heavy leaps, and a vodyanoi came through the brush. He squatted in the froggish way of his race and raised webbed hands. When he jumped from the bank, his body—head and trunk all one fat sac—rippled with impact. Fejhechrillen was besmirched and tired, his motion ill-suited to woodland.

They were anxious, not knowing how long they should wait, if any others would come. Cutter kept asking how they had heard his message. He made them unhappy. They did not want to consider their decision to join him: they knew there were many who would think it a betrayal.

""He'll be grateful,"" Cutter said. ""He's a funny bugger and might be he'll not show it, but this'll mean a lot, to me and to him.""

After silence Elsie said: ""You don't know that. He didn't ask us, Cutter. He just got some message, you said. He might be angry that we've come.""

Cutter could not tell her she was wrong. Instead he said: ""I don't see you leaving, though. We're here for us, maybe, as well as for him.""

He began to tell them what might be ahead, emphasising dangers. It seemed as if he wanted to dissuade them though they knew he did not. Drey argued with him in a rapid and nervy voice. He assured Cutter they understood. Cutter saw him persuading himself, and was silent. Drey said repeatedly that his mind was made up.

""We best move,"" said Elsie, when noon went. ""We can't wait forever. Anyone else is coming, they've obviously got lost. They'll have to go back to the Caucus, do what's needed in the city."" Someone gave a little cry and the company turned.

At the hollow's edge a hotchi rider was watching them, astride his gallus. The big war-cockerel plumped its breastfeathers and raised one spurred claw-foot in curious pose. The hotchi, squat and tough hedgehog man, stroked his mount's red comb.

""Militia coming."" His accent was strong and snarling. ""Two men militia coming, a minute, two."" He sat forward in the ornate saddle and turned his bird around. With very little sound, with no metal to jangle on wood-and-leather straps and stirrups, it picked away high-clawed and belligerent, and was hidden by the forest.

""Was that—?"" ""What—?"" ""Did you fucking—?""

But Cutter and his companions were shushed by the sound of approach. They looked in unsaid panic, too late to hide.

Two men came stepping over fungused stumps into view. They were masked and uniformed in the militia's dark grey. Each had a mirrored shield and ungainly pepperpot revolver slack at his side. As they came into the clearing they faltered and were still, taking in the men and women waiting for them.

There was a dragged-out second when no one moved, when befuddled and silent conference was held—are you, are they, what, should we, should we—?—till someone shot. Then there were a spate of sounds, screams and the percussion of shots. People fell. Cutter could not follow who was where and was gut-terrified that he had been hit and not yet felt it. When the guns' heinous syncopation stopped, he unclenched his jaw.

Someone was calling Oh gods oh fucking gods. It was a militiaman, sitting bleeding from a belly-wound beside his dead friend and trying to hold his heavy pistol up. Cutter heard the curt torn-cloth sound of archery and the militia man lay back with an arrow in him and stopped his noise.

Again a beat of silence then ""Jabber—"" ""Are you, is everyone—?"" ""Drey? Pomeroy?""

First Cutter thought none of his own were hit. Then he saw how Drey was white and held his shoulder, and that blood dyed his palsying hands.

""Sweet Jabber, man."" Cutter made Drey sit (Is it all right? the little man kept saying.) Bullet had taken muscle. Cutter tore strips from Drey's shirt, and wound those cleanest around the hole. The pain made Drey fight, and Pomeroy and Fejh had to hold him. They gave him a thumb-thick branch to bite while they bandaged him.

""They must've fucking followed you, you halfwit bastards."" Cutter was raging while he worked. ""I told you to be fucking careful—""

""We were,"" Pomeroy shouted, jabbing his finger at Cutter.

""Didn't follow them."" The hotchi reappeared, its rooster picking. ""Them patrol the pits. You been here long time, a day nearly."" It dismounted and walked the rim of the arena. ""You been too long.""

It showed the teeth in its snout in some opaque expression. Lower than Cutter's chest but rotundly muscular, it strutted like a bigger man. By the militia it stopped and sniffed. It sat up the one killed by its arrow and began to push the missile through the body.

""When them don't come back, them send more,"" it said. ""Them come after you. Maybe now."" It steered the arrow past bones through the dead chest. It gripped the shaft when it came out the corpse's back, and pulled the fletch through with a wet sound. The hotchi tucked it bloody into his belt, picked the revolving pistol from the militiaman's stiffening fingers and fired it against the hole.

Birds rose up again at the shot. The hotchi snarled with the unfamiliar recoil and shook its hand. The arrow's fingerthick burrow had become a cavity.

Pomeroy said: ""Godspit . . . who in hell are you?""

""Hotchi man. Cock-fighting man. Alectryomach. Help you.""

""Your tribe . . ."" said Cutter. ""They're with us? On our side? Some of the hotchi are with the Caucus,"" he said to the others. ""That's why this place's all right. Or was supposed to be. This lad's clan got no time for the militia. Give us passage. But . . . can't risk a real fight with the city, so they've to make it look like it was us killed the officers, not their arrows."" He understood as he said it.

Pomeroy and the hotchi rifled the killed men together. Pomeroy threw one of the pepperpot revolvers to Elsie, one to Cutter. It was modernistic and expensive and Cutter had never held one before. It was heavy, with its six barrels arranged in a fat rotating cylinder.

""They ain't reliable,"" said Pomeroy, harvesting bullets. ""Fast, though.""

""Jabber . . . we better fucking go."" Drey's voice went up and down with pain. ""Fucking guns going off going to call them for miles . . .""

""Not so many nearby,"" said the hotchi. ""Maybe none to hear. But you should gone, yes. What you for? Why leave city? You looking for him come by on the clay man?""

Cutter looked to the others and they watched him carefully, letting him speak.

He said: ""You seen him?"" He stepped toward the busy hotchi. ""You seen him?""

As of Monday, Jan. 4 a.m. 10 a.m. ET:

– We are not using the words “militia” or “militiamen” on their own. A “militia” is organized to “resemble an army” (Webster’s New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition). At most, this group may be called a “self-described” or “self-styled” militia. It doesn’t “resemble an army.” Note: Reporting indicates there may only be a dozen or so men doing the occupying.

– We are not calling this a “standoff.” A standoff requires two sides. Right now, one group is occupying some lands and buildings while the other (the government) is considering what to do. There’s an “occupation” and it may become a “standoff,” but it’s not there yet.

– We have been using the words “protesters” and “armed protesters.” But the word “protesters” is not entirely adequate. These are armed individuals who have occupied government property. They are not simply citizens peacefully expressing their opinions, which is how the word “protesters” is more often used. This is an “armed occupation.” They are “armed occupiers.” They are “armed men” or “armed individuals.”

“Militants” is a better word than “protesters.” A militant is “ready and willing to fight,” according to Webster’s. These men say they are. The dictionary also says a militant is “vigorous or aggressive in supporting or promoting a cause.”

– As we’ve previously discussed, it’s best to avoid labels if possible. Use action words to describe who these people are and what they want. They are an armed group. They want an end to federal management of public land in the west. They are armed anti-federalists who want the states to control public lands in the west (referring to them simply as “anti-government” is not quite right).

Addition at 1:30 p.m. ET:

When referring to the dispute that Cliven Bundy and others have with the federal government, don’t say it’s over “grazing rights.” Instead, say “grazing fees,” “grazing privileges,” “grazing permits” or some combination of those words — such as “grazing permits and fees.”

It seems longer ago, but was only last November when we wrote that “When There’s No Evidence To Support A Claim, We Should Say That.”

When Donald Trump kept saying this week that President Obama is the “founder” of ISIS, we simply said in our reports:

- It’s a “false claim.”

- It’s “unbelievable.”

- That there’s an “obvious fact check here — President Obama did not found ISIS.”

- It’s an “unfounded claim.”

- It’s an “unfounded assertion.”

We also, of course, explored the history of ISIS and the role that U.S. policy during the Obama and previous administrations has played. As Ari Shapiro put it, “the true story of the U.S. and ISIS is complicated and nuanced.”

Thanks.

- “Trump Fires Back Against Fallen Muslim-American Soldier’s Father.”

- “Donald Trump Targets Muslim Soldier’s Parents Over ‘Sacrifice’ Remark.”

- Donald Trump has been in a “war of words with the parents of a Muslim Army captain who was killed in Iraq.”

Those are headlines and copy from some stories in the media this week.

Three things come to mind:

1. It seems insensitive to use war or violent metaphors in stories that involve the death of Army Capt. Humayun Khan in Iraq and his parents’ high-profile comments about Trump. What’s going on between Trump and the Khan family is not a “war” when compared to what Capt. Khan experienced.

2. As we’ve said before, clichés are to be avoided at all costs — especially during election years, when they spread like wildfire. In a Hall of Fame for clichés, war-related ones would be among the first inductees.

3. On any given day there may be an attack or battle in which people are killed. The juxtaposition of a headline or story about politics that is peppered with war clichés alongside news of real people dying in real warfare can make it look as if we’re not careful with our words.

Speaking of campaign clichés, two others phrases have been brought to our attention in recent weeks — “on the campaign trail” and “threading the needle.” You can probably think of others you’ve heard or read that sound tired. Let’s try to avoid all of them. The AP’s list of campaign clichés includes:

- Horse race

- Laundry list

- Pressing the flesh

- Barnstormed

- All those state nicknames

It’s that time of year again, so here’s a reminder:

If you feel a holiday cliché trying to tiptoe into your copy, please resist.

From last year’s post on this topic:

– “ ‘Tis the season to …” No, it ’tisn’t. – “ ‘Twas the night before …” It ’twas? – “Over the river and through the woods …” It’s been a while since we rode a sleigh to grandmother’s house. – “Bah, humbug.” Be miserly with your references to Dickens. – “Oh, the weather outside is …” Don’t put that song in my head! – “It’s beginning to look a lot like …” Not that one either! – “Yes, Virginia.” No, Korva. – “Christmas came early for …” Really? Seems like it’s always on Dec. 25. – “Jing-a-ling.” Jing-a-don’t. – “A Christmas Grinch stole …” Every burglar doesn’t have to be be turned into a Dr. Seuss character this time of year. – “Santa’s elves …” They’re everywhere! – “On the Xth day of Christmas …” The song is boring enough as it is.

As we also said last year, you may be able to play around with these holiday evergreens. You might stand one on its head, so to speak.

But the guidance we’ve given about adjectives applies in most cases to clichés as well: if you see one, kill it.

In other words, say “no, no, no,” not “ho, ho, ho.”

A U.S. service member was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan's restive Helmand province Tuesday — the second U.S. combat death in Afghanistan since January.

The service member was conducting ""train, advise, assist activities"" with Afghan forces when the explosive device went off, according to the U.S. Defense Department. Another American service member and six Afghan soldiers were wounded in the attack near the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.

""We are deeply saddened by this loss, but remain committed to helping our Afghan partners provide a brighter future for themselves and their children,"" said Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

NPR's Tom Bowman reports for our Newscast unit:

""[The attack] comes as 100 additional U.S. troops have been sent to Helmand Province to advise and assist Afghan police. ""Earlier this year, the U.S. command sent 500 U.S. soldiers to train Afghan troops in Helmand, where the Taliban is seizing more territory and threatening the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. ""Most of the 10,000 American troops in Helmand and throughout Afghanistan are training local troops and work out of large bases. Still, some U.S. special operations troops continue to partner with Afghan soldiers on missions. ""In January, an American Green Beret, Sgt. Matthew McClintock, was killed in Helmand in a Taliban attack.""

Reporting on Taliban gains near Lashkar Gah, The Associated Press adds:

""The Taliban have seized a number of nearby districts in recent weeks and now threaten to overrun the city itself. Local officials have estimated that around 80 percent of the province has fallen or is in danger of falling to the Taliban.""

The Defense Department says 23 U.S. service members have been killed in Afghanistan since combat operations ended nearly two years ago.

The slain service member's name is being withheld until next-of-kin can be notified."

""That's frickin' sick!""

At the moment when Dan Klein, singer of the retro reggae outfit the Frightnrs, saw the finished cover of his band's first full-length album, Nothing More to Say, he was sitting in his apartment in Windsor Terrace, situated in a narrow strip of blocks between Brooklyn's Prospect Park and Greenwood Cemetery. On the cover, Klein is crouching, all sharp angles: hunched shoulders, bent elbows and knees. His bandmates, Rich Terrana, Chuck Patel and Preet Patel stand in a row to his left, upright, their jackets just as wrinkled at the joints as Klein's, just lived-in enough, the level of worn that comes from breaking them out for special occasions and big gigs. Their frontman's eyes are fixed to the ground, but Terrana and the Patels gaze at the lens, the vibe calmed by the violet rendering of the original photo.

The cover reflects the thought and care the Frightnrs have put into their streamlined, vintage sensibility that emerged as the Jamaica, Queens-based group found its footing in a scene shaped by ""years of ska-punk crossover and a lot of fake, white-rasta stage antics,"" as Klein put it. ""We wanted to come across as the Rat Pack,"" he said of the musicians' aesthetic and penchant for '70s rhythms that distanced them from their peers. ""We wanted to be sharp. We wanted to wear suits, be dark, get down to business, all 'This is New York.' We looked like a soul band, and we also enjoy a lot of Motown, doo-wop, blues and gospel music, and I think that comes out in our music.""

There's an effortless cool to the cover of Nothing More to Say that matches the music inside, and a discussion of this — of ""cool"" as a state of being, a vibe, a reflex or an instinct — brought an intense shine to Klein's eyes. ""Because of circumstances, this record is particularly significant, because it's going to be our only record,"" he said. ""Everybody wanted to make sure it's just right. It turns out we already had some pictures from last year that were very much appropriate for what we're going for. It didn't even occur to anybody that we'd want to use those. I'm really relieved. Those pictures were the right ones.""

That afternoon, Klein, having long since lost the ability to crouch the way he does on the album cover, was sitting upright thanks to the chair he now spent his days in, a position that facilitated breathing with the help of a machine that routinely filled his lungs. As he looked again at the artwork — which Gabe Roth, the founder of Klein's label, Daptone Records, had finalized just a few days before — the comment was made that the guys come off as the epitome of cool, that they don't even look like they're trying to nail the shot.

""Really?"" Klein paused. The machine clicked. He breathed. ""I'm trying really hard.""

Nothing More to Say was supposed to be a collection of triumphant firsts for the Frightnrs, for Daptone, for everyone involved in the project. It is the Frightnrs' first full-length album, and it follows three EPs, the most recent of them being Inna Lover's Quarrel, which Mad Decent put out last September. It is the first reggae album released by Daptone, the first deviation for the Bushwick-based label — best known for championing artists with hard-lived stories to tell, like Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings and Charles Bradley — from its brassy, funk-laden foundation of soul (save for its recently launched rock imprint, Wick Records). It is the first record produced by Victor Axelrod, a.k.a. ""Ticklah,"" for the label, which is a doubly special event considering his close Daptone ties: An organist / piano player / man-on-the-keys of different persuasions and a prolific reggae composer based in Brooklyn, Axelrod has been around since the days before the Dap-Kings and Antibalas, back when members of both outlets played together as the Soul Providers in North Brooklyn in the late '90s.

It is also singular for being the first album Daptone will release following the death of one of the artists who made it.

On June 8, Klein, in spite of the concerns of his family and caregivers, went to Prospect Park to see Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings perform. Axelrod, who plays with the Dap-Kings for special occasions, joined them onstage that day, having heard about the difficult year Jones was having; she's in the process of battling cancer for the second time. Klein sent a simple ""Nicely done, sir!"" text to Axelrod following the gig. He succumbed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease, in the hours following the performance. The illness had first seeped into his muscles, making them feel strained and foreign, in the summer of 2015, just days after he and the Frightnrs began recording Nothing More to Say with Axelrod at Daptone's House of Soul studio.

""Things were moving along and going well, but there was this lingering issue of, 'What the hell is wrong with Dan? Why is he being such a drag?'"" Axelrod recalls in a conversation several weeks after Klein's death. ""It was during that week in the studio that his symptoms started to manifest to the point where he was really struggling to sing and was complaining about feeling lousy and weak the whole time. This continued for the rest of the summer into the fall, when we were recording his lead vocals, but it wasn't until the end of November that we all learned what was going on with him.""

ALS is a brutal and efficient disorder in which fatigue and weakness are eventually followed by loss of motor function and muscular degeneration, but its invasion of the body offers no exact timeline. Immediately following Klein's diagnosis, the Frightnrs, Axelrod and Daptone found themselves challenged on two fronts: by their own stubborn standards for creating a superlative record with Daptone's trademark throwback vibe, and by the mechanics it takes to do that on an intimidating and tragic deadline. From November onward, pressure forged the backbone of Nothing More to Say: The Frightnrs' time with Klein was finite, as was their opportunity to cut the record with Axelrod, and they needed to work through their anguish before Klein lost his ability to breathe, and to sing.

Axelrod says urgency was in the air long before anyone knew Klein was sick: Now that the Frightnrs, Axelrod and Daptone had found each other, they didn't want to wait to get Nothing More to Say out of the House of Soul and onto turntables. ""The profound change in the energy surrounding the album was that it went from the normal process of working on music to meet a label deadline to working on the album as quickly as possible in an attempt to have it released before Dan passed away,"" he says. ""It was a horrible feeling to work with. It felt ugly and surreal for all of us in the final months of completing the record. We got through it and did everything we needed to do. I just think it felt like we all had 50-pound weights strapped to our chests while we did it.""

Axelrod spent two days snaking wires and finagling mics to zero in on the time-traveling sound of Nothing More to Say. His microscopic approach to the technical minutiae isn't simply the process of a perfectionist: It's both reflective of Axelrod's commitment to a band he's believed in for years and an economical strategy, considering the suffocating deadlines and Klein's declining health. Through the window by the soundboard at the House of Soul, one can see into the recording room, where Klein cut his vocals in the same spot that Amy Winehouse sang her way through some of Back to Black's most beloved tracks and Sharon Jones gave voice to Give the People What They Want just before her own fight against a deadly illness nearly derailed her career.

""It's not uncommon to have very little time to record with a group of people and therefore rush through this initial process, only to have some possibly deep regrets later,"" Axelrod says of his meticulous preparations. ""I went into the studio with the idea that there would be a certain character to the sound of the record, which was to be established up front rather than on the back end. Everyone was patient with me, thankfully. The songs were all pretty new to everyone involved, so it was also a good way to just get settled in — for them to play a lot and go over the songs while I turned knobs.""

Axelrod saw the Frightnrs for the first time in 2011 at Otto's Shrunken Head, a tiki bar in the East Village that serves tropical drinks and hosts small shows in its back room. Their idiosyncrasies and instrumental flourishes struck him immediately. ""There were subtleties in their playing and the way they sang together that really resonated with me,"" he recalls. ""Dan's energy was simultaneously subdued and manic. He looked so uncomfortable with himself, but there was a sound that came from him that had everyone in the room mesmerized for the whole show.""

This sound, which harkens back to the soul-inflected stylings of '60s and '70s reggae, hit Axelrod's ear as informed and appreciative. This was hardly a band participating in musical tourism, but a band that lived and breathed vintage reggae — Alton Ellis, Delroy Wilson, Toots and the Maytals — and studied up on how these Jamaican singers were informed by the soulful hits coming out of Motown a decade prior, a tie that would later lay the foundation of its relationship with Daptone.

""There are all kinds of different rhythmic and textural approaches that are a part of the history of this genre, and it's not all late-'70s Bob Marley,"" Axelrod says. ""I could hear that the Frightnrs were loving and learning from different aspects of reggae that I also love and try to learn from. I can't say that about too many other groups of musicians. They're also a great example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. They know how to play together — with each other.""

It's easy to picture Axelrod staring down a stubborn microphone as he coaxes it into position to record Terrana's metallic cymbal hits or Patel's bobbing bass lines: The dual pulses of the rhythm section were stronger as a unit, and stronger still when recorded to the same track, even if it meant hours of additional setup time and a riskier endeavor to tackle in post, if need be. But it was Klein's voice — a resonant, somber tenor that took on the tone of a begging lover (""Gotta Find a Way""), a cheeky fighter (""Trouble In Here"") or a frustrated romantic whose best intentions have been defeated (""All My Tears"") — that stood out to Axelrod as a vital organ of Nothing More to Say.

""You'll notice there are no Jamaican accents on this record,"" Klein said in May, his Brooklyn lilt serving as a point of pride that further differentiates the Frightnrs from other like-sounding acts. ""I sing in my regular voice; I sing as an American."" Some singers belt and wail and give off the impression that these could be the last notes they ever sing. The intensity of Klein's delivery doesn't squander the sad truth that the notes heard on Nothing More To Say are, in fact, the last he would ever lay to tape. ""Despite the fact that his symptoms had taken hold by the time we began recording his vocals, I feel like, more than ever, Dan really found his voice as a singer and writer for this album,"" Axelrod says. ""I think the lyrics and melodies that Dan wrote for this album show the depth of his talent like never before.""

Klein was a part of the process up until his passing, checking in with Daptone to see about a confirmed release date and offering his insight on the tracks in mastering when he could bring himself to do so. ""I would check my emails sometimes, listen to things,"" he said. ""There were things that Victor would hear that I wouldn't; certain guys in my band would hear things. I don't have the same amazing ear for details. I was so desperate for the thing to be completed that I'd be more inclined to be like, 'That's awesome, let's go, let's go!' Half of me was overexcited and maybe not critical enough, and then the other half of me didn't want to listen to it because I didn't want to cry. There are songs on this album that I never got to sing in front of an audience. That's a bummer, you know? I'm really proud of it. I think we did a good job. We had the best help we could get.""

""I think everybody feels a certain onus as far as making this record happen,"" Roth says, sitting on the couch behind the engineer's chair at the House of Soul. He lives in Riverside, Calif., but was in New York in July on Daptone business, checking in with his staff, working on tracks for the forthcoming Sharon Jones album and surveying the pieces of the Nothing More to Say puzzle that had started coming together. On the morning of the Dap-Kings' Brooklyn gig five weeks prior, Roth had visited Klein in Windsor Terrace and told him that the album's release was confirmed for early September — later than they'd hoped, a result of overwhelmed vinyl pressing plants. ""I had to tell him that the record was coming out on Sept. 2,"" Roth says. ""He was a little disappointed by that. It was rough."" The announcement of the release date, the drop of the first song, the all-too-aptly named title track, the building buzz in the press — all are facets of the experience Klein missed, unfolding barely a month after his passing. ""I think that everyone top to bottom here feels like a certain sense of duty with that record,"" Roth continues. ""It's not just because Dan is gone; it's because it's such a beautiful record, and everybody feels like it's so important to get that record out to people. Obviously that task becomes a little more solemn. It feels a little more important. Mostly, it's very sad. But it's a great record, man.""

For Roth, the Frightnrs' commitment to the real deal is what made them a perfect addition to the label's roster. Klein, the Patels and Terrana looked to many of the same soul singers of the '60s and '70s for inspiration that Roth, Jones, the Dap-Kings and the Daptone roster at large have while building their reputation, and that kinship is rooted in more than old-school appreciation and well-worn suits.

""The way they're making music is the way we make music,"" Roth says. ""It's the same kind of love and respect, and soulful, not in the way of aping some style or trying to co-opt something that's not yours, but in the way of just being honest and making music that feels good and raw, stripping all the bulls*** out of the process, just systematically dismantling something until the only thing that's left is the real part of it. That, to me, is what that their record has. It has this real raw, naked kind of soul to it, which is what we aspire to as far as Daptone and the way we try to make records. The way that Victor recorded it, the way it's put together, it was just a lot of balls and a lot of heart, and not a lot of bulls***.""

Speaking to Klein in his final days, it was apparent he'd been thinking about what the album meant to him, especially now that he likely wouldn't live to see its release.

""The songs that I wrote were my personal stories of relationships and personal growth, and what I was going through before I knew I was sick,"" he said. ""I wish my relationship to the songs was that I can't wait to go sing them live on tour, opening for other Daptone acts. But now it's more what I'm leaving behind. It makes it more significant in that way.""

This is where a first chapter turns to a final one, where a debut becomes a legacy. The swift loss of life is devastating enough, but to extinguish the Frightnrs' run just as the flame of their success was beginning to spark feels especially, needlessly cruel on the part of fate. And yet, from the most difficult challenges one can face, Nothing More to Say emerged as a polished, seemingly effortless work of art. Though Klein's passing is deeply felt by those who knew him and the artists he counted as friends and family, the strength of the album, and knowledge of the superhuman determination it required to make it at such a breakneck pace, comfort in the wake of grief. Nothing More to Say is not just a premiere, not just a meticulously crafted and ruthlessly good record of unique reggae that could only be created by crate-digging kids that call the Queens County Jamaica home instead of the Caribbean one. It's an uppercut straight to the chin of mortality, thrown by some of the best musicians in the business.

Klein may have been trying really hard — during his cover photo shoot, during the vocal sessions he tracked with the clock running out — for the big break he didn't get to fully realize. But he wasn't alone."

When the financial crisis hit in 2008, Imbolo Mbue lost her job. ""I was very disillusioned about America ..."" she tells NPR's Rachel Martin. ""I was unemployed for over a year and a half.""

Originally from Limbe, Cameroon, Mbue came to U.S. to go to college. After losing her job, she had to start over from scratch — and that led to her sitting down to write her debut novel Behold the Dreamers. One day, while walking down the street, ""I got an inspiration to write this story,"" she says.

Her protagonists, Jende and Neni, are two Cameroonian immigrants trying to make it in New York. But the recession threatens their livelihood and strains their marriage.

""For me, personally, the financial crisis laid bare a lot about the way in which the American dream is not that accessible to everybody ..."" Mbue says. The novel gave her a way to explore and express how the financial crisis affected her perspective on America.

On Limbe, Cameroon, the hometown she shares with her characters

It's a beautiful seaside town ... in the south of Cameroon ... about 80,000 people. Back when I was growing up it wasn't a very fancy town – we didn't have a public library, we didn't have nice hotels, we probably had like one or two hotels. But now it's fairly developed.

We have lots of nice hotels and nightclubs and a lot of tourists come to Cameroon to see Limbe because it has really beautiful black sand beaches. But it's still a place where it's very difficult to change your circumstances if you are born poor.

On how she came to the U.S.

I had relatives who were very generous to sponsor me to come to America to have an education. So I came here to go to college — I went to Rutgers in New Jersey. And then after [college] I moved to New York City and I went to Columbia for my masters.

On expectations of America

What I'd seen about America on TV was, you know, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and The Cosby Show and everything was so glamorous. And I didn't really see much of the difficulty and challenges of being in American — the poverty, the racism — I didn't see much of that.

I think it was the same for Jende and Neni — they had this idea of America being this really, really wonderful place — and it is a wonderful place, it's a beautiful country — but there are challenges to being an immigrant here. ...

[They] are struggling to get by as immigrants ... even if there are opportunities, it's still a challenge to move out of poverty. I've seen that in my life, too.

On the definition of success

They both believe in the American dream. So they had similar ideas, but like in any marriage, at some point people start changing and they start having different ideas of what America means to them. ...

I think for Jende and Neni it was very much about the price they had to pay for this dream. ... They both had to consider: This is the price I have to pay to have the life I want in America and is this price worth it?"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Apple Music Apple Music

The wait for a new Frank Ocean album is over — sort of. Late Thursday night, the reclusive singer unveiled Endless, a starkly minimal multimedia project that does indeed feature new music, but leaves many other questions unanswered.

With listeners everywhere processing Ocean's latest creation in real time, we asked our NPR Music's Jason King and Ann Powers to share their first impressions. Jason fired the first volley: Hear his chat with All Things Considered at the audio link, and read on for his discussion with Ann.

Jason King: Discombobulation — to be confused, or upset, or disconcerted, or pained, or to feel like you've come apart, that you're all over the place — is the word that randomly popped into my mind this morning. Feeling discombobulated is the way many of us live these days, given the crushing weight that our overdeveloped media and war industrial complexes seem to impose upon us; living in the era of Trump swagger and Syrian warfare and Ryan Lochte falsehoods and music you want to hear but can't because it's locked behind a streaming-service paywall feels jarring more often than not. In some ways, discombobulation has become the new normal; even the randomness of feeling out of sorts can work like perfect serendipity, if you look at it from another perspective.

Discombobulation is also a word that suits the unconventional, messy rollout of two of this year's most highly influential albums: Kanye West's The Life of Pablo and Rihanna's Anti. We can now add Frank Ocean's to the list of pop releases surrounded by misinformation and controlled by someone disinterested in getting with the program. Since going largely off-the-radar after his watershed 2012 studio debut Channel Orange, and teasing fans in the interim with numerous false starts and canceled deadlines, Ocean's new project, called Endless, finally dropped today. What's frustrating is that we haven't been given enough information to know if Endless is just a teaser for a more pop-oriented album that's rumored to be coming or if this is it. Indeed, Endless provokes a crisis of legibility — how to effectively read its value and meaning given the deliberate withholding of information that would help contextualize it. But context may be overrated these days.

Endless is billed as a visual album, meaning there are 18 tracks you listen to as you watch a 45-minute video (directed, executive produced and creatively directed by Ocean himself) in which the singer engages in some sort of unexplained power-tools construction project. If I were feeling especially generous I'd say the black-and-white video is wonderfully Warhol-esque in its pursuit of anti-narrative, but I can't help think that it's really painfully slow, visually inert and much less stimulating than Beyoncé's highly considered Lemonade. Far more compelling is Frank Ocean's new music itself, featuring buzzy-hip collaborators like Jazmine Sullivan, Sampha and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead. The music and sonics of Endless are hydra-like, featuring a surfeit of creative ideas: The whole affair can be dark, moody, drifty, ambient, textured, druggy, somnambulant, melancholic, Eno-ghostly, synthy and depressive. It can be melodically rich, even if its lethargic sameness can sometimes be snoozy.

But the ADD way that Endless' songs and interludes change, move, shift and blend and bleed into each other, as Frank himself moves between languorous singing and draggy rapping, makes the hyperactive scrawl aesthetic Dev Hynes / Blood Orange recently explored on this year's Freetown Sound album seem comparatively straight ahead and conventional. Standout lyrics like ""How come the ecstasy always depresses me?"" on Arca-assisted interlude ""Mine"" and Ocean's ranty, freestyle-type delivery on ""U-N-I-T-Y"" are among the album's most artistically impressive moments.

Still, after the first few listens, I'm not particularly sure what Endless adds up to or if it's even supposed to gel at all. It's like having only one corner section of a jigsaw puzzle — it just so happens to be a musically gorgeous one. Keeping fans in the dark and teasing them only with eccentric, confounding parts of a larger whole is certainly one way to hijack their short-span attention. And if it's too early for my definitive critique of a 45-minute audio-visual project that probably needs more time to wash over me, props to Frank Ocean for releasing the most bizarre and artsy example of corporate-event pop ever. We all know that Ocean has collaborated with Apple as exclusive distributor of the album (at least for now), and it's more than a bit strange that he chooses to close the album with ""Device Control,"" a Euro-disco-esque track featuring Wolfgang Tillmans chatting about a range of smartphones including ones made by Apple, Sony and Samsung. Given that it's the last track, the idea of Frank giving so much shine to Apple's competitors on an Apple-distributed project is either a curious F-you to the hand that's just fed him, or it's one blithely WTF moment in an album that seems to be full of them. So double props to Frank for introducing a potentially discombobulating, disruptive moment to the usually unassailable Apple.

Ann, I'd be curious to know your initial impressions of the album.

Ann Powers:

Jason,

Last night, when Frank Ocean's livestream workshop came back to life after sitting dormant for two weeks and it became clear he was building a stairway to sudden-release heaven, I sat listening to the muffled music coming from his speakers in the background and started to think about other staircases: ones that lead nowhere, like those in the Winchester Mystery House, a famous haunted California manse where carpenters worked around the clock to stave off the demons of its mistress. That house has doors that open to walls, weird turrets and twisted hallways, and a Séance Room that only those who understand its mazes can reach. Endless is the sonic equivalent of that structure. Even after several listens to the actual album, I feel like this music is still being constructed. Ocean welds these tracks together in spiral patterns; the video asks us to observe this process of creation, to slow down and ponder how this carpenter builds along the lines of his story pole. As someone with a 2016-appropriate short attention span, I have always found such process-oriented music somewhat difficult to absorb. But I welcome Ocean's challenge that we do so.

Endless does fit in with the year's other ""discombobulated"" releases, especially Rihanna's, which has a similarly labyrinthine structure and depressive ambiance. The associations it immediately brings to mind, however, come from the art world. Ocean made his aspirations toward gallery life explicit by enlisting sculptor Tom Sachs as a collaborator, recreating his Jamaican-style sound system simulacrum and getting his advice on those stairs. Making his fans live with that off-and-on live stream, where he only tinkered for so long, did both challenge the norms of corporate product and make gentle fun of Apple's own irritating roll-out delays (come on, I really need a new Macbook Pro). But it also was part of the longstanding tradition of endurance-oriented performance art, which stretches back at least to the days when The Velvet Underground performed as part of Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable.

Hip-hop has always been intertwined with the gallery scene, from graffiti genius Jean-Michel Basquiat's 1980s heyday to Kehinde Wiley's current streetwise classical portraiture. Both Kanye West and Jay Z have extended this connection in recent performances: West has worked extensively with Vanessa Beecroft, known for her discomfiting use of live mannequins who must stay silent for long periods of time; Jay Z formed a brief, controversial partnership with Marina Abramović, who sat for nearly a month in MoMA's Atrium, welcoming silent interlocutors. In the rock world, PJ Harvey did something similar when she recorded her last album inside a glass studio in London's Somerset House. Waiting for Ocean to do something, anything with his power tools also made me think about the time-stretching magic of Christian Marclay's work, which is aesthetically and formally enmeshed with punk and art rock: the rough textures of Endless as heard in that first live-stream made me think of his film Guitar Drag, which, like much of this new release, confronts the tensions of a violent, racist world by releasing some noise into it. There's no getting past it — Ocean is super-arty. Releasing Endless before his hotly anticipated, ""official"" new album, Boys Don't Cry, tells us something about where he feels at home as a creator.

He also clearly wants to connect with an eclectic library of classic recordings. Many of the songs on Endless are very personal, with lyrics about Ocean's family troubles (""Alabama"" is poignant and angry), his chemical proclivities (alcohol, ecstasy, insomnia), and his sex life (""He came up in Dallas / He had no hazel in his eyes / Had them sailors on his thighs,"" from the sexplicit ""Commes Des Garcons,"" is a line Jean Genet would have recognized). But it's also essentially, slyly referential. Tom Sachs is known for jerry-rigging versions of other people's masterpieces, using duct tape and foamcore to comment on the ersatz nature of creativity. Ocean does something like that throughout Endless. As I listen, I hear so many ghosts of other gnomic masterworks and the artists who made them. He name-checks the Fugees at one point, and offers a homonym of The Beach Boys' Endless Summer at another, when he sings, as if from inside a wave, ""I know you're in there somewhere."" Production-wise, he and his collaborators are deeply indebted to Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and the experimental reggae of the great On-U Sound crew; I'd argue that his version of the Isley Brothers ballad ""At Your Best You Are Love"" is more evocative of the Caribbean than of standard quiet-storm R&B. The simmering thickness of these tracks, the way they veer from druggily rhythmic to diffuse — not to mention Ocean's self-tortured grapplings with success in songs like the moving lament, ""Rushes To"" — also makes me think about Sly Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On, another album deeply reflective of the dark political moment in which it was produced.

From this sawdust-covered pile of reference points, Ocean constructs his own meanings, grounded in an artistic identity that probably couldn't have sustained itself in earlier pop moments. His frankness about erotically fluid desire harkens back to the urban night wanderings of Lou Reed and the poetic challenges of Essex Hemphill. Has Ocean read Hemphill's profanely gorgeous ""American Wedding,"" or spent time with Reed's odes to abjection on Berlin? I don't know, but those sources that never mingled in the past all seem to run through him. Ocean does strike me as an artist who absorbs source material eagerly, always adding more to the process he so openly shares. (And yes, I think of Kurt Cobain, too, of the hidden Nevermind track ""Endless, Nameless,"" which announced the Seattle rock savior's refusal to conform to anyone's commercial hopes.) If Endless is merely the precursor to the larger reveal of Ocean's intentions and realizations that Boys Don't Cry will offer, it's still a work with plenty of currents that draw me in. I'll see you at the top of that never-ending staircase."

Firefighters have reached full containment of a blaze east of Los Angeles that forced tens of thousands to evacuate their homes. At the same time, multiple wildfires continued to challenge crews throughout the state.

California's Department of Forestry and Fire Information declared the Blue Cut Fire 100 percent contained Tuesday — but not before the 36,000-acre fire destroyed nearly 100 homes and forced the evacuation of 80,000 people in San Bernardino County.

By Saturday, crews had largely contained the blaze, allowing the lifting of evacuation orders for many residents. NPR's Nathan Rott tells our Newscast unit that more than 300 crews were pulled off the fire as it dwindled.

""Attention is turning from that fire ... toward others,"" Nathan says.

Statewide, 10,000 fire personnel are battling six major wildfires, including the Chimney Fire, which is burning in San Luis Obispo County.

That inferno has already consumed 53 structures and 37,101 acres in Central California near the Hearst Castle, built by publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, now a tourist attraction.

On Saturday, the California Parks Department announced the property's closure owing to poor air quality. It remains closed through the week.

Nearly 4,000 fire personnel are working on that fire, which is considered 35 percent contained.

In Northern California, the long-burning Soberanes Fire is 60 percent contained. The fire has been burning for a month and has consumed some 87,000 acres north of Big Sur. At least one death has been attributed to the blaze.

And just west of Los Angeles, the Rey Fire is burning through wilderness in Santa Barbara County. So far, 27,000 acres have burned. The fire is 30 percent contained."

Hopefully the points that follow are clear:

1. We have a detailed “Policy On Use Of Potentially Offensive Language.” Print it and read it.

2. Any clip with offensive language must be brought to the attention of the DMEs well before air time. Basically, as soon as you think you might be using it, talk to them. They may need time to consult with Legal.

Note: It does not matter if the words have already been bleeped. Be prepared to justify their use. a. By the way, it’s assumed show executive producers and desk chiefs will already have been consulted.

b. The standards & practices editor should also be flagged.

3. The DMEs have yea-or-nay authority.

4. DACs lines must tell stations the specific language that is in the cut, when it occurs and whether it is bleeped. Those lines must go out with as much lead time as we can give.

5. If the words are bleeped, they must be completely bleeped. No syllable can be heard.

6. We do all this because we respect our audience and know that certain language will offend many. We also know that community standards vary around the nation and that complaints to the FCC can be costly to our member stations.

7. Overall, NPR is conservative about potentially offensive language — not permissive. There’s a key line right at the top of our policy statement: “NPR has always set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive to our audience.” The words must be important to the piece.

On Super Tuesday Eve, here’s a reminder: there’s “no cheering [or booing] in the press box.”

This is very important, so we’re recirculating the guidance we posted last October about social media. It still applies.

Everyone should be familiar with our thinking:

The presidential campaign … and breaking news events … draw many of us to social media. We want to monitor the news, post our reporting, share the interesting information we find and offer our thoughts.

That’s great. Have fun out there.

But … (there’s always a “but”) … all of us — journalists as well as those in other departments — need to remember that what we post and retweet can reflect on NPR. None of us want NPR’s reputation for fairness to be put in doubt because of things we do on digital platforms.

Our resources:

– The “Social Media” section of the handbook. The introduction specifically mentions NPR’s journalists, but the principles apply to others here as well. If you’re in doubt, talk to your supervisor:

“The Internet and the social media communities it encompasses can be incredible resources. They offer both a remarkably robust amount of historical material and an incredible amount of ‘real-time’ reporting from people at the scenes of breaking news events. But they also present new and unfamiliar challenges, and they tend to amplify the effects of any ethical misjudgments you might make. So tread carefully. Conduct yourself online just as you would in any other public circumstances as an NPR journalist. Treat those you encounter online with fairness, honesty and respect, just as you would offline. Verify information before passing it along. Be honest about your intent when reporting. Avoid actions that might discredit your professional impartiality. And always remember, you represent NPR.”

– “Some Guidance About Social Media On Election Day.” You could substitute the words “Debate Night” [or ""Super Tuesday""] for “Election Day.”

– “Reminder: There Is No Privacy On The Web, And ‘Personal’ Pages Are Not Safe Zones.” Here’s a key paragraph:

“Matt Thompson offers a test. Before posting something about your work or a news event or an issue, even if you’re putting it on what you think of as a personal page, ask this question: ‘Is it helping my journalism, or is it hurting my journalism?’ ”

Young Gun Silver Fox is a hard-to-resist duo. One member (singer-songwriter Andy Platts) is from California, while the other (multi-instrumentalist Shawn Lee) hails from London; fittingly, the duo's debut is called West End Coast.

You'll recognize the sound — as the band's label, Wax Poetics Records, puts it, it's a ""modern re-imagining of the classic West Coast AOR studio sound of the mid- to late '70s."" In other words: yacht rock. With these new songs, Platts and Lee have lovingly recreated a sound and vibe from the past.

When reporting about or from Myanmar, it is no longer necessary to say at the top that it is “Myanmar, also known as Burma,” as our style has been since 2011. We feel there are very few in the audience who still need that immediate reminder.

It is also no longer necessary to include the reminder about the name Burma in every report. Use your judgment. In longer pieces, and especially in those tracing the country’s recent history, an “also known as Burma” is appropriate and helpful.

Meanwhile, our guidance (and AP’s) has been that Myanmarese is the adjective to use when describing the people of that country. You should know, however, that there is disagreement over whether that is the proper adjectival form and that people in Myanmar do not refer to themselves that way. Many authorities say Burmese is the word to use, even when referring to the country as Myanmar. One way around all that, of course, is to say something such as “the people of Myanmar” or “the people here.”

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three — the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats — if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed — often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle — for example, surviving an air crash — that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place — or a small space like a lifeboat — with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there."

Ed Yong, author of I Contain Multitudes, says someday we might be able to improve our health by taking probiotics, but ""we are still in the very early stages of working out how to do this.""

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You may think you know who you are, but you don't really unless you're aware of the fact that there are trillions of microbes living on and in you. They affect your digestion, immunity, body weight and overall health. Scientists are researching what those microbes do and how we might be able to improve our health by manipulating the balance of those microbes. The ecosystem of microbes within humans and animals is the subject of the new book ""I Contain Multitudes"" by science writer Ed Yong. He writes about science for The Atlantic and writes a science blog hosted by National Geographic called ""Not Exactly Rocket Science.""

Ed Yong, welcome to FRESH AIR. So as you say, our body is really an ecosystem. What are some of the different communities of microbes on and in our bodies?

ED YONG: Well, there are tens of trillions of them all together, but they vary from one part to the other because, for example, my forearm is a quite a dry environment. It's a bit parched like a desert whereas something like my mouth or the inside of my nose is a hot and humid environment that's more like a rain forest. And each of these places harbors a very different community of microbes.

GROSS: And a lot of those bacteria - a lot of those microbes are good guys, helping your body do what it needs to do. But as you point out, if one of the good guy bacteria gets into the wrong spot, it becomes a bad guy.

YONG: That's right. We've had this long-standing idea that microbes are germs, are enemies that we need to destroy lest they destroy us. But actually we're coming to realize that many of these microbes are profoundly important for our lives. But I wanted to get across in the book that there isn't really any such thing as a good microbe or a bad microbe. They just live with us. They are our partners in life and they can often do us tremendous amounts of good. They can help to digest our food and tune our immune system and protect us from disease. But if they get in the wrong place or if our relationship with them breaks down, then they might also do us harm.

GROSS: So when we're talking about the microbes in the microbiome, obviously we're talking about bacteria. What else are we including in that?

YONG: So bacteria form the majority of them, but there are also another group of microbes called Archaea, which look very similar but are actually very, very different. There are single-celled fungi. There are protists. There are viruses, too, in huge numbers. Some people might not think of them as part of the microbiome, but they are there, too, and they are incredibly influential.

GROSS: I want to talk with you about probiotics. So many people take probiotics in the hopes of having a healthy gut. And among scientists who actually study the microbiome, which is the microbes living in the gut, it's actually pretty controversial whether probiotics accomplish anything. So let's start with what are probiotics supposed to do?

YONG: So probiotics are products that contain beneficial microbes, and they have all sorts of health claims attached to them, but actually if you look at the evidence behind these products, they tend to be a bit medically underwhelming. So they're good for certain types of infectious diarrhea but not a huge amount else. And even regulators in the U.S. and the - and in Europe have taken a dim view of many of these health claims. And I think that's because probiotics contain typically small numbers of microbes, much fewer than already exist in your body.

A lot of these species are being chosen for historical reasons because they're easy to manufacture and package, not because they're excellent at establishing themselves in the gut. And often they're very industrialized, very proprietary strains. You know, they enter and then they disappear or they pass through. They don't have a huge amount of impact. And yet, the idea behind probiotics, the idea that we might be able to give ourselves beneficial bacteria that improve our health, that idea has a lot of potential, and it is solid.

But we are still in the very early stages of working out how to do this. It is about engineering an entire ecosystem. It's about - it's as complicated some say, like, changing a coral reef or a grassland. It's a - it's about sculpting a world.

GROSS: So when we take a probiotic that we bought in a store, are the bacteria in that probiotic likely to repopulate in our gut?

YONG: No, they're not. Typically, they don't manage to establish themselves, and they don't last for a long time, so they're not very good colonizers.

GROSS: And are they microbes that typically live in our gut?

YONG: They're microbes that can be found in the gut. But they're not - they're not the A-listers. They're not the ones that are especially common or especially good at colonizing the gut.

GROSS: What about yogurt, which usually has active cultures in it, probiotic cultures?

YONG: Same thing. Studies have shown that you swallow them and those bacteria then disappear. They - I think of them as, like, a breeze that blows between two open windows. It might rattle a couple of objects in the way, but it doesn't have a lasting impact.

GROSS: You're depressing me.

(LAUGHTER)

YONG: I'm sorry.

GROSS: OK. When you take antibiotics, the antibiotics kill off a lot of the bacteria in your body, including ones that you would prefer to have and some of those bacteria that you'd prefer to have live in your gut. And I think that's at least one of the reasons why taking antibiotics can lead to diarrhea because it kills off some of the bacteria that keeps your gut in balance. And that's usually a time when even doctors who don't especially believe in probiotics still recommend that you take it. So what's the common wisdom now among scientists who are actually studying this about the value of taking probiotics as an antidote to antibiotics?

YONG: Well, so some types of antibiotic-associated diarrhea involve this very nasty, weedy bacterium called Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, which is very good in invading guts that have been repeatedly assaulted with antibiotics and can cause recurring intractable cases of diarrhea. And actually one of the best treatments for C. diff - oh, and in fact, one of the most successful microbiome-based treatments we have is a thing called a fecal transplant. A fecal transplant is almost exactly what it sounds like. You're trying to take the stool from a healthy donor and implant it into the gut of someone who's sick. And you are doing that almost as a way of resetting their inner ecosystem, of replacing a community that has been faltering, much like trying to re-turf a lawn that's been overrun with dandelions or other weeds.

GROSS: And how is that being done now? It's been in its experimental stages, but I think they're kind of perfecting ways of doing it without being - without it being as gross as it sounds.

YONG: So the traditional way is to use actual stool and it can be delivered either up the bum or down the nose via a tube. And, you know, it does have this ick factor attached to it. But it is also spectacularly effective at treating infections of Clostridium difficile - C. diff - this very invasive, weedy bacterium that can cause recurring severe diarrhea. In one now classic study, some 20 - or 27 percent of people who took a common antibiotic were cured of C. diff infections whereas those who receive fecal transplant, about 94 percent of them were cured. So we're in this weird position where the number one treatment for C. diff is a number two. And...

GROSS: (Laughter).

YONG: ...Fecal transplants are - have been - have done wonders for this particular condition. Whether it works for other diseases - so in - so following the successes with C. diff, scientists and doctors have tried fecal transplants for a large number of other conditions that have been linked to the microbiomes, things like inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome.

And there, the results are less - certainly less successful, a bit less consistent. And that's probably because those types of diseases - those ecosystems inside us - are more difficult to reset. So others - other researchers are now trying to take the concept behind fecal transplants and refine it to pull out the bacteria and other microbes that are conferring the benefits to the recipients without having to bother with the gross fecal bit.

So several companies have developed pills that are - you can think of them either as, like, pared-down stool or souped-up probiotics, right? So they are communities of microbes that are meant to replicate a lot of the benefits of doing a stool.

But recently, one of the most leading contenders for these fake poop pills flunked out of a major clinical trial, which I think emphasizes how little we know still about why this age-old procedure actually works and how early we are in the process of actually manipulating our microbiomes in order to improve our health.

GROSS: Did you say this was an age-old procedure?

YONG: Yeah. Well, it first started - I think the first records were from China several centuries ago. And people have sort of rediscovered it time and again. And it's only become - I'm not going to say popular - but certainly more prominent in the last 10 - maybe even five - years or so.

GROSS: So why is it that a fecal transplant might be more effective than a probiotic pill?

YONG: So there, you're using a much wider community of microbes. And you are giving them in large numbers. And you're using the ones that are naturally there in the gut anyway. So it's a much more realistic community to implant in a person. But, you know, the real answer to this question is we still don't entirely know.

We don't really know which components of stool - which members of that community - are really doing good, how they might interact with the native microbes in a recipient's gut or with the gut itself, with the immune system of the host.

There are still so many questions that we have left to answer. All we know is that for this one particular condition, C. diff infections, it seems to be a very, very good treatment with few known side effects, if any. And that's very cheap.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" Let's take a short break. And then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and has a science blog for National Geographic called ""Not Exactly Rocket Science.""

Microbes can contribute to our immune system. And you describe how microbes can trigger inflammation. And microbes can also suppress inflammation. Can you give us a sense of the interplay between those two sets of microbes and how they regulate our immune system, for better and for worse?

YONG: Right. So we typically think of the immune system as this militaristic force that defends us from the microbes in the world around us. And yet we see that certain types of microbes help to build parts of the immune system. And then they also calibrate it.

So they strike this balance between reacting - between protecting ourselves from infections - but also not overreacting. So they help - some species help to stop the immune system from going berserk at harmless things in our environment like pollen or dust, things that might trigger allergies.

And that balance between inflammation and anti-inflammation is very much affected by our microbes. They set that tipping point, much like the thermostat in my house might control the temperature of a room and keep it stable.

GROSS: So this interaction between microbes that suppress inflammation and those that trigger it are being studied in germ-free mice, mice that are meant to have a controlled environment within them because they're germ free. How do you create a germ-free mouse?

YONG: You raise them in the sterile isolators, these plastic bubbles that are completely disconnected from the microbial world. The mice are the only things living inside them. They have sterile food, sterile water. Anything that's put in gets sterilized before it's connected to these chambers.

And I think that makes these mice some of the strangest animals on the planet. I visited one of the facilities that raises them. And I held one not with my bare hands but with this black rubber glove that protrudes into their plastic bubble. And this is an animal that, unlike anything else - unlike you or me or an elephant or an - anything - has no microbe.

It's like a silhouette that hasn't been filled in yet. And because of that, it has a lot of problems. It has different - it has problems with its bones, its blood vessels, its gut, its behavior. It testifies, I think, to just how important microbes are for sculpting and shaping our bodies and how much can go wrong if we live our lives in their absence.

GROSS: So what kind of experiments on immunity and inflammation are being conducted on these germ-free mice?

YONG: And so, for example, you can give them specific microbes and see which types of immune cells rise to the fore, like what - whether you see an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory response. And we can see that certain microbes can actually tune down inflammation which is an odd concept because I think we think of microbes as foreign, as other, as things that trigger information. Whereas we see with rodent experiments that some species that live with us are actually capable of quenching inflammatory fires, so they are capable of calming the immune system and saying I come in peace.

GROSS: What are the implications of this for autoimmune diseases, diseases in which the body attacks healthy body cells?

YONG: So theres a growing body of evidence suggesting that early exposures to a wide range of microbes is important for carefully building and calibrating our immune systems to strike that balance between immune reactions and not going nuts at the things in the world around us. And, perhaps, by avoiding contact with microbes either by living in urban environments or by sanitizing our worlds too much, we are breaking our contact with all of these old friends that we rely upon to tune our immunity, leaving us ill-prepared for dealing with all the challenges of the wider world, for dealing with all the stuff that might then trigger an immune response.

GROSS: What you're talking about, too, here is the theory that when children are born - when babies are born and they pass through the vaginal canal, they get exposed to a whole set of microbes that a baby needs to develop a healthy microbiome and that babies who are delivered through a C-section do not get exposed to the same microbes. Can you talk a little bit about that and what the latest thinking on that is?

YONG: Sure. So the womb is a sterile environment and we - and babies first encounter microbes when they pass through the vaginal canal during birth, and they set the tone for all the other microbes that then colonize the child. If you are born through a C-section, you encounter a different set of microbes that might come from say the skin or the hospital environment. So we see different communities in babies that are born from different roots.

Now, what that means for a child's future health is still very much unclear. We see from studies in adults that people who were born through C-sections or through normal vaginal roots don't actually end up with vastly different communities of microbes on their bodies. So it seems that in the long run, a lot of these differences shake themselves out. But whether those temporary differences can affect our health, whether they change the way our body develops at a very crucial point in our lives is very much an open question. We don't know the answers to that yet.

GROSS: Well, I'm glad that the C-section babies seem to catch up because a lot of women have to have C-sections, and I'd hate to think that they have to feel guilty that their babies aren't going to have healthy microbiomes as a result of that.

YONG: Right. I don't want to demonize anything, and I don't think microbiome science is in this - is in a mature enough state to make people worry or feel guilty about their health choices yet or their life decisions. And it's helpful to think of the body as these sets of grand ecosystems. You know, if you change a jungle or a grassland, you know, it's not going to go wildly off course through simple means.

Often, you need to ding these things multiple times from multiple stresses, say, pollution or fire or whatever before they go - they shift into an irreversible new state. So ecosystems are resilient. They can absorb a lot of change, and the same is true for the microbiome. If you ding it with, say, antibiotics, if you change it through, say, a C-section. It will move. It will change, but often it bounces back. And the big questions are, you know, what sorts of changes do you need in order to really change it? And do those little changes matter in the short term? And I think we don't know.

GROSS: My guest is Ed Yong, author of the new book ""I Contain Multitudes"" about the trillions of microbes that live in and on us. After we take a short break, we'll talk about the microbes in breast milk and how bacteria are being used to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses like Zika and dengue fever. And as the Olympics near the conclusion, Milo Miles has a review of an album from a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Ed Yong, author of the new book ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" It's about the trillions of microbes that live in and on humans and animals and how this ecosystem affects our digestion, immunity and general health. When we left off, we were talking about how this ecosystem is affected by the microbes you're exposed to as an infant. For example, scientists are studying how babies are colonized by bacteria during childbirth as the babies pass through the vaginal canal.

I think scientists are also investigating the difference between breast feeding and bottle feeding when it comes to developing a healthy microbiome in an infant. What are some of the differences between the bacterial makeup or the microbe make - microbial makeup of breast milk - human breast milk - versus cow's milk?

YONG: Well, so human breast milk seems like a very straightforward way of nourishing a baby. But actually about 10 percent of breast milk consists of these sugars, these complex sugars that babies can't digest at all. And they are there to nourish the microbes in the baby's gut. There are specific strains, including one called the...

GROSS: I'm going to stop you here, so part of breast milk is to feed the microbes (laughter).

YONG: That's right, yeah.

GROSS: That's kind of fascinating.

YONG: It's amazing, isn't it? I think this is why I love the science of the microbiome because it takes very familiar things like breast feeding and casts them in a completely different light. So breast milk isn't just a way of nourishing an infant. It's a way of nourishing babies' first microbes. It's really a way of engineering an entire world inside a baby's body. You know, breastfeeding mother is a sculptor of ecosystems.

GROSS: And cow's milk doesn't have that?

YONG: Human milk, for reasons that are still unclear, seems to have a much wider range of these sugars than the milk of any other mammal. There are very specific strains of microbes, including one called B infantis that have evolved to digest these sugars with great efficiency. So in the guts of breastfed infants these microbes tend to dominate.

And they have benefits for the baby, too. They feed the baby's gut cells in return. They help to seal up the lining of the gut, and they reduce inflammation. So they have - they have tremendous benefits. And by nourishing those microbes, mothers are also helping their own kids.

GROSS: I want to get back to talking about the germ-free mice and the use of mice that are living in germ-free bubbles so that scientists can experiment on them, exposing them to certain microbes to see what the response is. One of the things that scientists are studying in this kind of germ-free mouse is obesity and body weight. Would you give us a sense of the kinds of experiments being done relating to body weight with these germ-free mice?

YONG: Sure. So about 10 years ago, in some very classic experiments, scientists took microbes that were from obese and lean individuals and put them in the sterile mice. So the mice that received the obese community's put on more weight than their counterparts who received the lean ones. And that was a seminal finding. It really showed that perhaps these microbes aren't just, you know, going along for the ride. Maybe they're actually grabbing the wheel now and then. Maybe they are seriously influencing our weight, the way we deal with the energy in our food.

The thing is that the links between obesity and the microbiome are actually very complicated. And even though there's been 10 years of research, there are still a lot of things we don't know. So people have found differences in the microbe communities between people who are fat and lean. So you get different species that rise to the fore in different groups. But there aren't consistent differences between studies. So it's still really hard to say what, say, a, quote, unquote, ""obese microbiome"" looks like, let alone how you might want to manipulate it.

And one critical study that was done, again with these germ-free mice, showed that if you take the microbes from a lean individual and put them in a rodent that has put on too much weight, then that rodent will lose weight but only if it also eats a traditionally healthy diet that's full of plants and fiber. And I think that shows that the microbiome might be deeply influenced in our lives, but it doesn't provide any easy solutions to health problems. When the first wave of studies came out about 10 years ago, headlines were full of things like, you know, blame microbes for your weight or maybe we'll be able to take some probiotic that immediately causes us to lose weight. And I think it's nowhere near that simple.

The microbiome is not a panacea for our health problems. It doesn't explain them all in their entirety. I think it just shows how important microbes are in our lives and what a strong influence they have.

GROSS: And this is why someone - and I forget who it is - gives an award that's named the Overselling the Microbiome Award (laughter).

YONG: (Laughter) That's right, yeah. His name is Jonathan Eisen. He's a wonderful microbiologist. He's a true champion, an evangelist for microbes. But he's also very skeptical, and I think with good reason for a lot of the claims that are surrounding the microbiome. This is one of the most fashionable areas, the hottest areas of modern biology. And the microbiome has been linked to all sorts of health problems.

But a lot of those studies are still correlative. We still don't know whether the microbes are leading to the disorders, whether they're a consequence of them, whether it's both or neither. And we are still at this very early stage of understanding our partnerships with the microbes that share our lives. We know they're important. But how important are they? And in what ways, and how might we be able to influence them?

GROSS: So when it comes to microbiome research, it seems like we're still kind of in the infancy of it. We know enough to know this is a really promising field. We might learn a lot about foods to eat and not eat, about things to expose ourselves and not to expose ourselves to. We might find new cures for autoimmune diseases. But right now, it seems like it's still in the formative stages, very experimental.

YONG: Yeah, very much so. We've known about microbes for over 350 years. But the science of the human microbiome has really only taken off in the last decade or so. And there's so much we don't know. We don't still have a full catalog of the species that live inside us. We still don't really understand what makes my microbiome different to yours. What explains those variations between people - much less what a good microbiome looks like or how you might get to that stage.

But I think the potential there is huge because the microbiome is theoretically very flexible. We should be able to change it. We just don't quite know how yet. And maybe one of the quicker wins with microbiome science might be to use the microbiome as a sort of diagnostic tool, of looking at it and say what you're more likely to develop - this disease or that disorder - or to use it to influence our treatment. So we know that microbes within us affect how well medicines work in our body. We know that a lot of different drugs, from the hottest new cancer immunotherapy drugs to obvious things like acetaminophen can work in some people and not in others because of which microbes they carry.

And maybe we might also be able to find ways of influencing the microbiome without needing to add or subtract strains. So there's one group that does a lot of work on heart disease. And we give - if you have a high risk of heart disease, your doctor might prescribe you a statin, which is a drug that's designed to target enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism that are made by your own body. But bacteria can also affect the way you deal with cholesterol, and they could also contribute to the risk of heart disease in that way. And now some - one group of scientists has developed a molecule that can stop these bacteria from leading to rises in cholesterol. So maybe in the future you might get a combination of two drugs from your doctor, a statin to treat the human half of you and another chemical to affect the microbial half.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" Let's take a short break. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is science writer Ed Yong. His new book is called ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us And A Grander View Of Life."" He also writes about science for The Atlantic and does a science blog for National Geographic called ""Not Exactly Rocket Science."" Not everybody has a favorite microbe, but you do (laughter).

YONG: Yes.

GROSS: Tell us what it is.

YONG: I do. It is called Wolbachia. It was discovered in 1924, and it was found inside a common brown mosquito by two scientists, Hertig and Wolbach. And for decades, no one knew what it did or how common it was, whether it was important. It was largely neglected. And then scientists realized that actually it's incredibly common. It's not found in humans, but it is found in some 4 in 10 species of insects and other arthropods, which are themselves the most numerous and most diverse animals on the planet.

So Wolbachia is extraordinarily successful, and it does all sorts of incredible things. So in some hosts, it is a parasite that has a thing out for males because Wolbachia only passes down from mothers to daughters, and so males are a complete dead end to it. In some - in some species, like woodlice, it converts males into females. In others, it kills males outright so that the females outnumber males by 100 to 1.

And in some wasps, Wolbachia allows them to reproduce by cloning themselves, so they have no need for males whatsoever. But in some cases, this thing is also an ally. It is a mutualist. It allows some caterpillars that eat leaves to stop the leaves from turning yellow. It actually holds back the progress of fall so that these - its hosts can have more to eat. And it has properties that are really important to us humans.

So Wolbachia is found in parasitic worms that cause debilitating tropical diseases like elephantiasis and river blindness. And by finding drugs that can kill Wolbachia, scientists are finally looking for and discovering effective ways of curing and treating these illnesses.

GROSS: But what about mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika? There seems to be some relevance there, too.

YONG: That's right. Wolbachia turns out to be a really powerful way of controlling mosquito-borne diseases. So scientists in Australia have spent about 25 years trying to load this bacterium into Aedes aegypti, the tiger mosquito, the one that spreads dengue and yellow fever and infamously now Zika. And they've been trying to do this because Wolbachia seems to prevent these insects from transmitting the viruses behind these diseases.

And Wolbachia is so good at spreading through a wild population that if you release a small number of these infected mosquitoes, they ought to fly off into the distance and then within months Wolbachia should be everywhere, thus rendering this entire community of insects unable to spread disease. They - the bacterium changes them from vectors into dead ends. And this was tried for the first time in 2011 in several suburbs of Australia. And this team showed indeed that Wolbachia rises to dominance in these natural populations, and they're now trying this approach in big megacities around the world, in places like Brazil and Colombia and Indonesia and Vietnam. And there are so many...

GROSS: Places with mosquito issues.

YONG: Places with mosquito issues, places with severe dengue problems. The approach was initially developed in order to eliminate dengue fever, but it seems to work against Zika, as well against a lot of other mosquito-borne diseases, and it has tremendous advantages. The - unlike, say, insecticides, which are toxic and need to be continuously resprayed, Wolbachia in these mosquitoes seems to have no problems, no safety risks. And it sustains itself. Once you release the insects, they go off on their business and you don't need to keep on replenishing them.

GROSS: So you're not messing with the mosquitoes' genetics. You're introducing a bacteria?

YONG: That's right. There is no genetic modification. These mosquitoes are not GMOs to speak of. They've been simply united with a bacterium that is already present in a large proportion of other insects.

GROSS: So now that you see your body as housing huge communities of microbes, how has that changed your life? Has it changed, like, what you eat or how you behave or what you expose yourself to?

YONG: I'm certainly less fearful of the microbial world than I would have been 20 years ago. You know, I don't - I wash my hands of course, but I don't over-scrub them. I don't use sanitizers. But, you know, really what writing this book has given me is a broader perspective of the world around me. So I always loved the natural world. You know, I was that kid who went to zoos all the time. I would watch wildlife documentaries and read books about nature.

And now I understand that all this biology which I thought I knew, all these creatures, these elephants and hawks and fish that I was fascinated by, these things I could see with my eyes, are actually deeply and profoundly influenced by things that I cannot see. And I know that if I go to a zoo now that every animal and every visitor in that zoo is in fact a zoo in its own right.

GROSS: Give us an example of an animal that you see differently now.

YONG: There are - in the very deep oceans, there are environments called hydrothermal vents, these belching chimneys of superheated water. And there's a worm that lives in these vents called riftia and it's - it can grow a few metres long, and it has these beautiful red gills that look like someone's pushed a tube of lipstick out all the way. And this worm lives in this environment, which just hasn't got any food, but it has microbes in its body.

A lot of its body, probably the majority of it, consists of bacteria. They grab minerals from the vent environment and use these to create nutrients. And that is entirely how the worm sustains itself. This animal has lost its mouth and it's gut because why bother having a digestive system at all when you don't need to eat when you have microbes inside you to provide you with all your energy? And I think that's just a stunning example of how intimate the animals can evolve to rely upon their microbes. This is a creature that would not be able to survive at all without the multitudes inside it.

GROSS: Don't you wonder what the world looks like from the point of view of the microbes that you write about, like, if one of the microbes was writing this book, how different it would be (laughter)?

YONG: I feel like we wouldn't even get a mention.

GROSS: (Laughter).

YONG: We are just this footnote, this icing on the - on this gigantic microbial cake. You know, in the book, I talk about how if you condense the history of the Earth into a single calendar year, so the Earth was created in the first of January and we are now in the 31 of December just before the stroke of midnight, then humans arose about 30 minutes ago. And even all the multicellular creatures, the things we can see, all the animals and plants we're familiar with, only arose a couple of months back whereas bacteria probably first evolved, say, at the start of March. So for the vast majority of life on Earth, everything was microbial.

You know, bacteria have been the rulers of the planet for most of the Earth's history, and they are still the rulers of the planet. They still govern the movements of chemicals all around the world. They are in every possible habitat. They are omnipresent, and they are hugely influential. And in many ways, our bodies, the bodies of every other animals or our cities that we are so proud of, all of these are just more habitats for bacteria and other microbes to inhabit.

GROSS: Ed Yong, thank you so much.

YONG: Thank you very much for having me.

GROSS: Ed Yong's new book about the microbes within us is called ""I Contain Multitudes."" After we take a short break, Milo Miles will review an album by a Brazilian bossa nova ensemble. This is FRESH AIR.

Alonzo, if a new law in Italy passes, parents will face jail time if they force their kids to do what?

ALONZO BODDEN: Oh, is it food related?

SAGAL: It is.

BODDEN: Of course. If they force their kids to diet?

SAGAL: Close. If they force their kids to go on a particular kind of diet.

BODDEN: No pasta? No bread?

SAGAL: No, the other way.

BODDEN: Oh, all pasta?

(LAUGHTER)

ADAM FELBER: All bread.

BODDEN: That would be the other way from no pasta...

SAGAL: Yeah.

BODDEN: ...Would be all pasta.

BILL KURTIS: (Laughter) Yes.

BODDEN: What would be...

SAGAL: ...Just, you know, spaghetti and soy balls are not the same.

BODDEN: Oh, if they make them go vegetarian?

SAGAL: Even worse, if they make them go vegan.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

BODDEN: Well they - well, that's not going to happen.

FELBER: Well...

PAULA POUNDSTONE: What is the...

SAGAL: ...Not if the Italian parliament has anything to do with it.

BODDEN: The Italians aren't that dumb, are they, that - I thought only we played with that nonsense.

SAGAL: The bill, which was proposed by Italian lawmakers this week, says that any parent who denies their child of the pleasures of an ossobuco or just a nice carbonara sauce will go to jail. This is because veganism is thought by some to be dangerous for young children and also because, well, have you ever met a vegan?

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: The truth is a vegan diet is better for the planet, better for one's health and obviously more humanitarian. What a weird Italian law.

SAGAL: Well...

POUNDSTONE: ...I mean, I'm not a vegan, but I admire those who are. I would rather not talk to them, but I admire them.

This week's Invisibilia podcast and show explore what happens when people flip the script, responding to situations in ways that are completely unexpected. We tend to respond to aggression with aggression, kindness with kindness. Usually that works just fine. But sometimes turning 180 degrees can change the world. Think Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr.

In this Invisibilia excerpt on NPR's Morning Edition, we tell the tale of a mellow Washington, D.C., dinner party that was suddenly interrupted by a man with a gun. ""Give me your money,"" the man said. Or he would start shooting.

The diners tried to persuade him to back off, but the situation was getting increasingly tense. Then a woman named Christina did something simple yet extraordinary. And that changed everything.

Manual Cinema, a live performance company, re-enacted the dinner scene from this week's Invisibilia episode using projectors, shadow puppets and live music. You can check out the complete behind-the-scenes version of the production here. Manual Cinema/NPR YouTube

(Check out the video, above, that the performance collective Manual Cinema created for Invisibilia about the dinner-party robber and the unexpected outcome.)

In NPR's health blog, Shots, Invisibilia co-host Hanna Rosin explains what she found when she traveled to Denmark to check out a radical experiment in flipping the script. It involves the local police and dozens of young Muslims who were planning to run off to Syria and join ISIS.

We also asked psychologist Christopher J. Hopwood to explain the science behind what happened at the dinner party. Psychologists call it noncomplementarity — responding in an unexpected way to prompt a positive response. It's used in psychotherapy, and it also can work to make relationships better in your own life."

The news from North Carolina about its gender identity law and from several states about laws allowing businesses to refuse service to LGBT customers make this a good time to reread our guidance on avoiding politicized, or loaded, language. It’s here.

Some key points:

– “Strive to use words and phrases that accurately deliver information without taking sides on emotional or political issues.”

– “In such cases we go with what’s accurate. And err on the side of neutrality.”

– “We also take the time to explain to our audience how certain words or phrases have taken on politically loaded meanings.”

– “Politically loaded language not only violates our commitment to be fair, but also gets in the way of telling good stories.”

Basically, beware the language and labels that any side wants us to use. We figure out for ourselves what’s the clearest thing to say.

Videos and audio clips of someone being shot, a disaster victim crying for help, bodies being recovered and other potentially disturbing scenes present us with challenges.

When weighing whether to post such videos online and to use any clips on the air, keep in mind that:

– Conversations are required. The senior news manager on duty (a DME or the designated supervisor) must be consulted. The Visuals team should be pulled in. Other senior editors may be as well.

– The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

– But we can’t be callous. The video may show someone’s death. Out of respect for that person and that person’s family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someone’s moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

– We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

– “Every other news outlet else is using it” is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

– Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

– The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do won’t work. Each situation is different. However:

– If it’s decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a “click” to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

– Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that it’s coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

– We should consider whether a video’s disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

– If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlet’s edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: ”The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.”

– When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, we’ll be in agreement and can link to the station’s coverage.

But, But, But:

– Does this mean we’ll never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: “We report the news, good and bad.” We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

– Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe we’re making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Nextdoor/Screenshot by NPR Nextdoor/Screenshot by NPR

Think before you post.

That's not the message you typically get from Internet companies. The ethos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram is to (over) share. But Nextdoor, a social network, has decided to block users from publishing certain posts, specifically when they appear to be racial profiling.

A techie tackles race

Talking about race and racial profiling does not come naturally to Nirav Tolia, the CEO of Nextdoor. And yet, he's doing it anyway.

""What someone considers to be racist is something that is, unfortunately in many cases, in the eye of the beholder,"" he says. ""Why do some people like Trump and some people think that he's Satan?""

Tolia is a tech entrepreneur, not a politician. Nextdoor is a popular social network for neighborhoods. You use your real name and address to join an online group with your real neighbors.

The company is confronting a tough problem: How do you stop an activity when people can't even agree on how to define it? Jaywalking and speeding are easy. Racial profiling does not have a universally accepted definition, as criminology experts note.

In the face of public criticism by users who felt the site was permitting racism and fear mongering, Nextdoor decided to create a working definition that is relatively broad: anything that allows a person to stereotype an entire race. And throughout this summer, in a move that's highly unusual for a tech company, Tolia and his engineers have been testing ways to put a stop to it online.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

People engage in racial profiling ""often not on purpose,"" Tolia says. It's implicit bias. For example, he says, a user might think: ""If I look out my window, and I see someone breaking into a car, and the only thing I see is that they're dark-skinned, why can't I post [it]? That's all I see.""

The problem with that post — ""a dark-skinned man is breaking into a car"" — is that, while the activity sounds like a crime, the description of the alleged perpetrator lacks any useful detail, like what he was wearing, his sneakers, his hairstyle or height.

""Because that message goes out to the entire neighborhood, where presumably many of the neighbors reading the post are dark-skinned, that would be considered racial profiling,"" Tolia explains.

Nextdoor was no stranger to such posts. The end effect, he says, was more hurtful than helpful, generating animosity among neighbors, rather than useful tips for law enforcement.

How it works

In a pilot project running in select neighborhoods across the U.S., the company has altered the rules for posting. When a user goes to post about a crime or suspicious activity, in the Crime & Safety section, a new form requires two physical descriptors — e.g. Nike sneakers, blue jeans, crew cut, brunette — if the user chooses to include the race of the person.

An algorithm under development spot checks the summary of the suspicious activity for racially charged terms, as well as for length. If the description is too short, it is presumed to lack meaningful detail and is unacceptable.

If a draft post violates the algorithm's rules or the form's mandatory fields, the user has to revise. Otherwise, it's not possible to post.

""This is a very, very, very difficult problem in society,"" Tolia says. ""Do I believe that a series of forms can stop people from being racist? Of course I don't. That would be a ridiculous statement.""

Fear of friction

The move to block posts sparked heated internal debate, Tolia admits. ""It's highly unusual for a social network to say: If you don't do this, you cannot post. Highly unusual. I mean, think about Twitter or Facebook or Snapchat. There's no friction at all in the process of posting.""

In tech, ""friction"" is a dirty word. Engineers rack their brains over how to shave seconds off the time it takes to broadcast you to the world.

Some Nextdoor engineers argued that the company should just politely suggest, not require, a better description. They pointed out that when people complain — about bullying, hate speech, revenge porn — on other social networks, those companies don't change their product.

""They may write a blog post, they may make a donation to charity, something like that,"" Tolia says.

Thus far, the company says there's been roughly a 50 percent reduction in racial profiling posts. Tolia's goal, he says, is to drive the number of instances down to zero.

Backstory: A local campaign

There's an interesting backstory here. Ultimately, it was a sustained grass-roots campaign in Oakland, Calif., that compelled the tech company to act.

A group called Neighbors for Racial Justice met with Nextdoor and handed over a blueprint for how to change the platform. Then, they got city officials to weigh in aggressively. For example, at a hearing last December, City Council member Desley Brooks said that if the company doesn't take steps to stop racial profiling, ""we as a city ought to say that we will not allow our employees to continue to post on Nextdoor and validate this poor behavior.""

Nextdoor recruits police and city agencies into the network. They're an added feature, a kind of Community Policing 2.0 that many users want. In the wake of the Dallas shootings, the police department there turned to Nextdoor to communicate safety updates to residents, and later to recruit for the police force. The network says it's partnering with more than 1,600 public agencies in the U.S.

Oakland Council member Annie Campbell Washington says at first Nextdoor employees involved in the discussion weren't willing to fundamentally alter the product. That changed when the CEO stepped in.

She says it's a rare win in Silicon Valley, to get a company to ask users sitting behind their screens ""to think about the person on the other side of the screen who's of a different race, a different ethnicity, and think about how that post may affect their lives.""

Some residents worried the grass-roots campaign was just the PC police. Campbell Washington recalls people writing in with questions: ""Why would you engage in anything that limits people's expression? And especially people who are trying to keep their neighborhoods safe.""

Then, the regular police weighed in. Oakland Lt. Chris Bolton says he would ""much rather"" have a detailed description about a factor that is ""very unique"" — the man who robbed me was wearing tennis shoes with red laces — than a vague description of just the sex and race of a person. He says the changes make Nextdoor more, not less, helpful for real police work.

Nextdoor plans to roll out changes to its entire U.S. network in the coming weeks."

The listener could have complained that “chomping at the bit” is a cliché, and that it’s one we’ve used at least three times so far this month. But his gripe was more specific — that we should have said “champing at the bit.”

To the dictionary we go:

Webster’s says “champ at the bit” is to “show impatience at restraint; be restless.” It comes from something said about horses when they bite their bits “repeatedly and restlessly.” They “champ.”

That fits with what we were trying to say this week about President Obama and his eagerness to get out on the campaign trail.

The AP says “champ at the bit” is “the original and better form.”

But, Webster’s adds that “chomp at the bit” is a variation.

What’s more, no less an authority than William Safire weighed in 31 years ago, saying that “to spell it champing at the bit when most people would say chomping at the bit is to slavishly follow outdated dictionary preferences.”

The Grammarist blog also comes down on the side of “chomping.” It points out that “champing at the bit can sound funny to people who aren’t familiar with the idiom or the obsolete sense of champ, while most English speakers can infer the meaning of chomping at the bit.”

We’ve been … itching to issue a note about some picky point of punctuation or grammar. After chewing on this one for a while, we’re not going to insist on “champing.” Feel free to use it. After all, you’ll score points with the lexicographers out there.

But “chomping” is fine.

Fine, that is, except for the fact that it is a cliché. As for them:

The singer-songwriter began performing at age 14 in a band with her sisters and her father. Critic Ken Tucker says the songs on Loveless' latest solo album, Real, have a ""tough edge.""

DAVE DAVIES, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Lydia Loveless is a 25-year-old singer-songwriter from Ohio, who began her career at age 14, performing in a band with her sisters and her father. Since launching a solo career, she's made four albums, the latest of which is called ""Real."" Rock critic Ken Tucker has this review.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""REAL"")

LYDIA LOVELESS: (Singing) When I'm watching on TV, and I know I shouldn't be because it doesn't compare to walking down your street.

KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: Lydia Loveless sings in the musical equivalent of declarative sentences. She states observations, descriptions and approximations of her emotions with direct language that doesn't have much use for metaphor or decoration. This, combined with her guitar playing on a song such as ""Midwestern Guys,"" gives many of her songs a tough edge.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MIDWESTERN GUYS"")

LYDIA LOVELESS: (Singing) These January nights, they really make me hate my life. And I want to get into a fight, but you already said you're not going to fall for that again this time. You want to paint you a masterpiece, but inspiration really doesn't always come out that easy. That's why they're always mad at me. You want to lock me in the kennel and then leave for Myrtle Beach, goodbye, all right. Midwestern guys, Midwestern guys, Midwestern guys, Midwestern guys.

TUCKER: Loveless traffics in songs that treat satisfying relationships as rare, fresh things that tend to spoil quickly. She doesn't spare herself in the parts she may play in these scenarios. On the song called ""European,"" she admits she's blowing up a perfectly good romance and is now reveling in remorse, or, as she says at one point, I just want to write what's been feeling so wrong.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""EUROPEAN"")

LYDIA LOVELESS: (Singing) There's a light on in your attic. I can see it. And it flashes for a dirty voyeur like me. There's a heartbeat on the air. I hear it, whispering beat, beat, beat, beat, beat. What's it going to take for you to let me inside? Man, I'm standing on your lawn and the grass is on fire. When I kissed you on the lips, I was being European. And, honey, come on, I just want to right what's been feeling so wrong...

TUCKER: Loveless is sufficiently intriguing and elusive to some that she's the subject of a new, as-yet-unreleased documentary called ""Who Is Lydia Loveless."" Her music gets slotted into various commercial categories - country, Americana, folk, rock, folk-rock, which usually ends up meaning the songs accumulate to form their own genre.

That's true of one of the album's most striking songs called ""Longer,"" which on its surface is an example of what the poet Franco Herro once referred to as his I do this, I do that poems. Loveless sings of banal activities as distractions to keep her from being overwhelmed by gloominess or depression.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LONGER"")

LYDIA LOVELESS: (Singing) You're tired of me hanging around, looking like I just lost a friend. Well, if I did, you don't know who. He goes to another school. 'Round 11 a.m. burn the breakfast again. Well, I don't know what I was doing, something that I saw on TV. It's true, and I need to get a clue. It's true, I need to get a clue. But give me just a little bit longer to get over you.

TUCKER: The song is called ""Longer"" because of the line give me just a little bit longer to get over you. What the key word also reminded me of is a variation on it, longing, the ache of desire. Lydia Loveless is an excellent artist about the nature of longing, the way it can pull you down and threaten to smother you or awaken you to new possibilities for connection and emotional satisfaction.

DAVIES: Ken Tucker is critic-at-large for Yahoo TV. He reviewed ""Real,"" the new album by Lydia Loveless. On tomorrow's show...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE HOLLARS"")

JOHN KRASINSKI: (As John Hollar) So how you doing?

MARGO MARTINDALE: (As Sally Hollar) I feel great.

KRASINSKI: (As John Hollar) You know, I've been Googling brain tumors - a lot more common than you'd think.

DAVIES: ...John Krasinski, who co-starred in ""The Office,"" directed and stars in the new film ""The Hollars"" about a dysfunctional family dealing with the illness of its matriarch, played by Margo Martindale. We'll talk with Krasinski about the film and his nine seasons on ""The Office."" Hope you can join us.

We'll end today's show with jazz harmonica player Toots Thielemans, who died yesterday at the age of 94. Harmonica's not an unusual instrument in blues and rock, but Thielemans made it a serious instrument in the world of jazz.

Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is known for his outspoken personality and oversize public image, which he believes help build his brand name.

""Whether it's good press or bad press, it's getting your name out there,"" Washington Post investigative reporter Michael Kranish tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. ""Getting your name on the gossip pages and the front pages and even the sports pages, [is] all in the effort of building the name.""

Kranish and his Post colleague Marc Fisher are the authors of Trump Revealed, a biography about Trump's life and career that is based on the work of more than 20 of the Post's reporters, editors and fact-checkers.

Fisher says 20 hours of interviews with Trump helped him come to a better understanding of the candidate. ""The man we've come to know and understand is someone who has led a strikingly solitary life given how public he is and how glad-handing his image is,"" Fisher said. ""When I asked him about friendships, he said he really doesn't have friendships of the kind that most people would describe.""

Interview Highlights

On what Trump was like as a kid

Marc Fisher: He was, by both his friends' description and his own, a rambunctious kid who got in trouble a lot and who was a bit of a ruffian. From the youngest age, about age 6 or 7, he pelted the neighbor's toddler with rocks from across the yard. He pulled the pigtails of a classmate. He got into a physical altercation with one of his teachers, and so he was someone who was kind of a rambunctious kid, even obnoxious by some accounts, and he says that he hasn't changed since second grade. So that kind of in-your-face provocateur character that we've come to see in the campaign is something that traces back very cleanly and consistently to this childhood as kind of a tough kid.

On how a lawsuit that charged his father's real estate company with racial bias influenced Trump's business philosophy

Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

Michael Kranish: This was a very serious lawsuit, one of the most significant racial bias cases at the time, and it's very interesting. We were able to obtain, under Freedom of Information Act requests, all of the transcripts for this court case. What happened was, Donald had to decide, was he going to settle this case or was he going to fight the federal government? One night in Manhattan he walked into a nightclub that he belonged to, and there was a man named Roy Cohn, and Roy Cohn of course is the famous or infamous lawyer who was the aide to Joseph McCarthy of the Army-McCarthy hearings that was held in the 1950s. Donald got to talking to Roy Cohn and told him about this racial bias case brought by the federal government, and Cohn, who himself had fought the federal government many times in his career, said: ""Don't settle. Fight like hell. When they hit you, hit back 10 times harder.""

The bottom line is, after this discussion at the nightclub, Donald Trump decided that he would, in fact, fight like hell, and he absorbed in a philosophy that he maintains to this day — when you're hit, hit back 10 times harder.

On Trump using a pseudonym to be his own press agent

Fisher: So what happened is in an effort to kind of spread his image around the city and around the country eventually, Donald Trump would act as his own press agent. He would call reporters as ""John Miller"" or ""John Barron,"" he wouldn't bother even to disguise his voice, but he would call them up and say, ""Donald Trump is going to be out at this club with this amazing celebrity or this model,"" or ""Donald Trump is going to be groundbreaking for a new building."" And he would kind of gin up press coverage as this alter ego, and he would also call reporters to complain about their stories or to encourage them to think about Donald Trump in a better light. ...

Some of the reporters who got these calls knew that it was Trump, and they thought this was kind of weird, but they went along with it; others didn't know. We were lucky enough to get a recording that someone sent me of one of these calls in which he presents himself as John Miller to a reporter for People magazine and if you listen to the recording, it sounds astonishingly like Donald Trump because it is Donald Trump. He carries this on as if no one knows what his very distinctive voice sounds like, and he talks about Donald Trump in this very extremely complimentary way and about what a ladies' man he is, and how women can't stop themselves from coming to him and seeking to go out with him, and this is something that he did for many, many years.

On Trump's debt in the 1990s

Kranish: [The banks] really felt that if they basically forced Donald Trump to repay his debts that they were going to lose everything themselves. Donald Trump had such extraordinary leverage that there came a day when the bankers were concerned that Donald Trump did not have insurance on his yacht, which he bought for some $20 million. Trump's associates basically told the bank, ""Look, you need to pay for the insurance on the yacht, because if something happens to it, you'll have nothing."" He eventually got the bank to pay insurance that Donald Trump himself didn't have. Similarly, Donald Trump had five helicopters the banks wanted to take back. For a time, he actually hid those five helicopters, because he was concerned they'd be swept up by the banks. Eventually they were turned over, but it just shows you the difficult times that Donald Trump was having at that time.

On Trump's business model of selling his name and his image

Fisher: Over time, what Donald Trump learned was that he could do all these things for himself. So the big question is, is he capable of doing this for anyone other than himself? And the track record really makes me kind of skeptical about that, because what we have is someone who, throughout his career, has found ways to enrich himself at the expense of others.

What Donald Trump learned from that experience in New York and Atlantic City was that he could build his entire business model around this idea of selling his image and his name. The more he got people to believe that his image was worth millions, the more he would be able to go out and sell just his name. So many of his latter day projects over the last couple of decades, in fact most of them, do not involve Donald Trump building anything, do not involve Donald Trump creating jobs, they involve Donald Trump going to a developer and saying, ""I will sell you my name that you can put on your building that you have invested in, with your money, and that you will give me a steady, guaranteed income flow."" That's the arrangement he had on many if not most of his building projects in the United States and around the world that have been done in the last 10, 20 years, and similarly with all the other businesses that he's gotten into, whether it's selling medicines or selling a university that he created. All of these things are cases where his involvement on a day-to-day basis is marginal or even nonexistent — what he's sold is the name, and he gets a set multimillion-dollar fee every year that's guaranteed, even if the project fails."

Please use phrases such as “secretly recorded” and “covertly recorded” when referring to the videos made by anti-abortion activists.

“Undercover” is another useful word. True, it may invoke in some listeners’ minds the image of a government spy who has gone under cover, but as an adjective it means “acting or carried out in secret.”

We have concluded that “sting” doesn’t apply because it is defined as “an elaborate confidence game” or “an elaborately planned operation engaged in by law enforcement agents to entrap criminals.” Those don’t fit in this context.

Gender Clinic, The Only One In The South

While a heated debate continues about North Carolina's ""bathroom bill,"" a clinic in the state is helping transgender teenagers transition. It's the only gender clinic in the South for teens.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

We've been hearing a lot about HB2, North Carolina's controversial bathroom bill. It limits the use of public restrooms. In particular, restrooms in public schools are restricted to the biological sex listed on a person's birth certificate.

As it happens, though, North Carolina is also home to one of the only gender clinics for kids in the South. Mary Harris from NPR member station WNYC's podcast Only Human spent a day there to find out who's coming in for treatment and how they're coping.

MARY HARRIS, BYLINE: The gender clinic at Duke University's Children's Hospital is only open a couple of days a month.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Drew, when's your date of birth?

DREW ADAMS: 9/29, 2000.

HARRIS: Fifteen-year-old Drew Adams is checking in. He was born a girl. But he's been living as a boy for the last year and a half.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Who's your primary care doctor?

D. ADAMS: Dr. Tarbox (ph).

HARRIS: It's Drew's second time here. He and his mom, Erica, drove almost eight hours to get here from Jacksonville, Fla. HB2's on their minds. Erica said that when Drew had to stop for a bathroom break on the way up...

ERICA ADAMS: I held my breath because you just don't know. You don't know if he's going to walk out, and everything's going to be fine. You don't know if he's going to be in there a while. I'm going to stand there and go, I wonder if anybody else is in there. I wonder if he's having to defend himself. I don't know what's going on in there.

HARRIS: Drew looks pretty androgynous. He's got blond hair cut short with a sweep of bangs across his forehead. He has a ring through the center of his nose. And as the medical assistant gets his height and weight, Drew squints at her through his wide, wire-framed glasses.

UNIDENTIFIED NURSE: I'm going to get your blood pressure.

HARRIS: He's hoping the doctor will prescribe testosterone - a once-a-month injection.

UNIDENTIFIED NURSE: Did you guys have any questions or concerns about anything?

D. ADAMS: Nope.

HARRIS: While they're waiting for the doctor, my producer, Jillian, asks Drew about the shirt he's wearing.

JILLIAN WEINBERGER: Can you tell me what your t-shirt says?

D. ADAMS: Yeah. It says, this is what trans looks like. And the word trans is in trans flag colors.

WEINBERGER: Where did you get that t-shirt?

D. ADAMS: Mom made it.

HARRIS: Erica's learned to embrace Drew's new identity because when he was living as a girl, she says he was really anxious and depressed.

E. ADAMS: Then after he came out as trans, it was like flipping a light switch. Suddenly, he has not had an issue with anxiety or depression pretty much since that day. He's been so confident. He's been so positive. He's so bright. That's kind of his mood all the time now.

HARRIS: She doesn't like talking about what Drew's life was like before he started transitioning. But when I asked her how she knew living as a boy was the right choice for Drew, she was blunt. She said, I'd rather have a living son than a dead daughter.

DEANNA ADKINS: Hey. How are you?

D. ADAMS: I'm great.

ADKINS: Excellent.

HARRIS: Dr. Deanna Adkins started this clinic. She's an endocrinologist, a hormone doctor. Drew is almost giddy to see her. When she walks in, his only question is, when can I start testosterone?

ADKINS: Today.

D. ADAMS: Yeah. Yeah.

ADKINS: Sound good? All right. All right. So yeah, I'll give you your prescription.

HARRIS: But going through this second puberty is controversial. Part of the reason Drew and his mom traveled here is because an endocrinologist in Jacksonville didn't feel comfortable prescribing these drugs.

When Dr. Adkins leaves to write up a prescription, the clinic's social worker comes in. She's got this packet of paper. It lists every potential side effect of testosterone. She starts reading off these statements for Drew to agree with.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Risks - I understand that the medical effects and the safety of testosterone are not completely known. There may be some long-term risks that are not yet known.

D. ADAMS: Yes.

HARRIS: Drew's required to affirm that he's heard all of them. And it's a long list. The hormones might give him headaches, high blood pressure, an inflamed liver.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Emotional changes, for example, and more aggression. I know that the effects of testosterone unfertility are unknown. I have been told that I may or may not be able to get pregnant, even if I stop taking testosterone.

HARRIS: Listening to all these side effects, I can't help but think, Drew's only 15. He can't vote, drink or drive. How does he know this treatment's right for him? Is he old enough to consent?

Some critics say teenagers are just too young to make such a huge decision. This clinic will sometimes tell kids they're not ready. But most of the time, the doctors here say they're mature enough.

Do you ever worry you're making this big decision - like, what if I change my mind?

D. ADAMS: Absolutely not. This is the happiest I've been all my life. Like, today, getting that prescription - like, probably the happiest I've been.

JAY: Hey.

HARRIS: Hello. This is Jay.

WEINBERGER: Hi. Nice to see you.

HARRIS: I'm Mary.

WEINBERGER: I'm Jillian.

HARRIS: We walk in to Jay's appointment just after lunch. Jay is an 18-year-old African-American trans woman who lives just outside Raleigh. She's here to get a prescription for estrogen.

What are you most looking forward to?

JAY: To be honest, I'm waiting for my boobies (laughter). To be honest, I'm ready. Yeah, I've been waiting a long time for, you know - to be able to develop breasts.

HARRIS: Jay is incredibly thin and perfectly styled. She has long fake eyelashes and lots of pink eye shadow. The only real sign she wasn't born a girl is the distinct shadow of hair on her neck. When she was younger, Jay thought she was gay. And when she came out, her mom was pretty supportive. But when Jay told her mom she was trans...

JAY: She was angry at me. She thought I was lying to her - I was living a lie. And it just took me by surprise that she, you know, wouldn't, you know, accept me the way I thought she would.

HARRIS: So part of the reason we're here is because North Carolina has been in the news so much because of this bathroom law.

JAY: Mhmm.

HARRIS: You got a look on your face when I said that.

JAY: Since I've lived here in North Carolina, I know how it is. And people that I know out of state - they're like, it's not that bad. I'm like, yes, it is. Like, I know a lot of discrimination, know places not to go where I could get hurt.

HARRIS: Jay can recite the names of trans women of color who have been killed over the last couple of years. She's scared that if she does something kind of normal, like make the first move with a guy, she'll get hurt physically.

How do you keep yourself safe in the outside world?

JAY: I stay home (laughter). It shouldn't be that way. But otherwise, you know, I like to travel in groups. I travel in groups. I don't like to go anywhere late at night. I don't like to - I don't seek out men. A lot of places don't feel safe. Work doesn't feel safe sometimes. Home doesn't feel safe sometimes. I'm safe when I'm by myself.

HARRIS: After seeing Jay, Dr. Adkins goes into this little work room to go over patient records and catch her breath.

ADKINS: I'm getting a little worried - I mean, not that I wasn't worried already. But I was just told by the third patient that they're moving out of state because they don't feel safe.

HARRIS: But more and more patients are coming to this place for help. The day we visited, this clinic was open for 12 hours straight.

ADKINS: The next new patient appointment's in November now.

HARRIS: And this is the beginning of June.

ADKINS: Yeah.

HARRIS: HB2 is being challenged in federal court. And Dr. Adkins is part of that case. She's hoping her testimony can help overturn the law. For NPR News, I'm Mary Harris in Durham, N.C.

MONTAGNE: And hear more from inside North Carolina's gender clinic for kids at onlyhuman.org.

If you use the word “factoid” to describe a single bit of important information or “factoids” to talk about several pieces of such data, we will get complaints.

Here’s why:

Norman Mailer gets the credit for coming up with the word “factoid,” which he used in a 1973 biography of Marilyn Monroe. Merriam-Webster notes that Mailer called them “facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper, creations which are not so much lies as a product to manipulate emotion in the Silent Majority.”

Mailer seems to have chosen the suffix “oid” because it forms “resembling” nouns. Think of it this way: A “humanoid” resembles a human — but isn’t human. A “factoid,” then, resembles a fact — but isn’t one, according to Mailer’s definition. Judging from our email traffic, plenty of people agree with him.

Now, English is a living language. Meanings do change. In 1993, William Safire worried that the word would come to mean “a little-known bit of information; trivial but interesting data.”

Safire was right. Webster’s New World dictionary defines the word as “a single fact or statistic variously regarded as being trivial, useless, unsubstantiated, etc.”

The Grammarist blog points out that that in the U.S., at least, “‘factoid’ is now almost exclusively used to mean ‘a brief interesting fact.’ … This definition is still considered incorrect by people who follow English usage, but it’s so widespread those who dislike it may eventually have to accept it, even if it does contradict the word’s original sense.”

Where does this leave us? If you want to be cheered rather than jeered for your attention to language, save “factoid” for those occasions when the subject is something that resembles a fact, but isn’t one. Or for things that are “trivial, useless [and] unsubstantiated.” For everything else, the simple word “fact” is accurate and you can save yourself a syllable.

As for words such as “literally,” “founder” and “reticent,” there are many online lists of those we all misuse. Here’s a Huffington Post version with 50 entries.

Our own list is here.

Ah, rum, with its legendary pirates bellowing for grog, tiki umbrellas peeking up from neon-colored cocktails, tequila-spiked punch at college parties. Rum, universally imbibed and yet often scorned. Most rum is ""the distilled essence of industrial waste,"" in the words of Wayne Curtis, author of And a Bottle of Rum: A History of the New World in Ten Cocktails. That waste is molasses, the byproduct of sugar production. After the molasses has been fermented, flavorings, colorings and sugar are often added in.

But craft rum — that is an entirely different and savory spirit, says Curtis: ""I've judged three spirit competitions in the past year, and I'm very bullish on rum.""

Not surprisingly, the South — once a hub for sugar plantations — is spearheading a craft rum renaissance, as small distilleries turn away from molasses and cull fresh sugar cane itself to create smooth liquors with grassy, warm, woody or floral flavors.

""Adventurous drinkers are starting to see rum as a terroir spirit,"" says Ann Marshall, who, along with her husband, Scott Blackmore, founded the award-winning High Wire Distilling in Charleston, S.C.

High Wire makes a traditional-style cane rum, inspired by the rhum agricole invented in the West Indies and strictly regulated by the French government there.

""The beautiful thing about agricoles,"" says Blackmore, ""is that you cannot add flavoring, coloring or sugar. It has to be distilled from raw sugar cane juice. We follow those rules, although since we are not located in the French West Indies, we call ours a Low Country agricole.""

To make its signature agricole, High Wire ferments fresh cane juice from locally grown cane that is distilled and rested in wooden barrels for a year. Says Marshall, ""We are taking this crop out of the ground and juicing it in its entirety — with bits of dirt, organic matter, all that delicious cellulose, those natural yeasts. That's why it tastes so unique.""

High Wire sources its flavor-intense, blue-ribbon variety of cane, with its signature blue-hued stalk, from three local farms. The differences in soil lend taste distinctions to each batch — the coastal cane has more salinity; the inland, a brighter, banana-like flavor. The bottles are appropriately labeled according to the farm the cane came from. ""I was talking to Wayne Curtis,"" recalls Blackmore, ""and he told me that in Martinique, the taste distinctions are so marked that they label each tank by the field or hill it came from, and then create a special blend. I find it more interesting, however, to keep them separate.""

A big challenge with fresh raw cane juice is to get it into the still as quickly as possible — within hours, says Blackwell. Otherwise it will start to ferment on its own. A sip of High Wire's agricole is indeed astonishing — fruity, earthy, pungent — and lingers on the tongue.

About 350 miles southwest of High Wire, in Richland, Ga., Erik and Karin Vonk of Richland Rum are crafting Richland Single Estate Old South Georgia Rum — the only single estate rum in the country, made from cane grown, cut, distilled and rested on the premises. They grow cane on their 100-acre plantation, cut and juice it, then boil it into a syrup that retains the bright vegetal and floral notes of the original plant. It is that syrup they ferment and distill, in copper, gas-fired stills hand-forged in Portugal. The rum is aged in white oak barrels for 32 to 48 months, with the barrel number printed on the label. (Used barrels go to Terrapin Beer in Athens, Ga., where the rum-infused oak lends a special flavor to aged beer.) International awards and gold medals have poured in for this field-to-glass rum, from the 2014 International SIP Awards to the 2016 Good Foods Award.

A Holland-born transplant, Erik Vonk says his grandfather's house in Rotterdam ""had high ceilings and paneled walls lined with bookshelves and bottles of fine rum. On holidays we'd end our meals with a rum-drenched plum pudding brought in flambé. Fast-forward decades later, and I decided to become a rum-maker.""

The soil in Richland is a loamy sand that grows an aromatic cane. The Vonks have experimented with 17 cane varieties, but their favorite thus far is an heirloom Georgia Red, which they learned to grow with the help of the University of Georgia. The couple plans to craft fresh — rather than aged — rum as well, a silkier, sweeter spirit they will call Virgin Coastal Georgia Rum. They will be opening a second distillery in Brunswick, Ga., a popular tourist destination on the coast, in 2017.

""You make what you grow,"" says Kelly Railean, the owner of Railean Distillers in San Leon, Texas, along the Gulf Coast. Rum has a long history in the region, and tiki bars abound. She opened her own rum distillery in 2007, and though many of her craft rums rely on molasses, she, too, makes a cane juice rum, which she calls Grand Cuvee Sugarcane Juice Rum and sells at her distillery only. ""I wanted to call mine an agricole,"" she remarks, ""because it truly is, but the U.S. agency that regulates liquor refused.""

""Rums made from sugar cane are grassy, fresh and herbaceous,"" she says. ""For those who are regular wine drinkers, I compare this kind of rum to a sauvignon blanc, as opposed to rum from molasses, which might be compared to a chardonnay.""

Nick Detrich, owner of the rum-focused New Orleans cocktail bar Cane and Table, says that ""for sheer variety, no spirit holds a candle to rum.""

If the rum you know and spurn is that sticky-sweet schlock, mass produced from molasses, it may be time to taste some Southern sipping-style rums.

""There's an artistry to rum,"" says Railean. ""A good rum can be savored just like craft bourbon.""

The Clinton Foundation is working now to ""spin off"" or ""find partners"" for many of its programs, including all international activities and programs funded by foreign and corporate donors, the head of the Clinton Foundation told NPR's Peter Overby. The ""unraveling,"" which would be an attempt to prevent conflicts, would go into effect if Hillary Clinton is elected president.

It will take time to make the changes to each of the foundation's affected programs, said Clinton Foundation President Donna Shalala. ""This kind of unraveling has to be done with a scalpel so that we just do not hurt people, and do not interrupt the very good work that's being done,"" she said.

Many of the foundation's programs would become separate non-governmental organizations ""without us participating in the governance obviously,"" Shalala said. Partner organizations, she said, would also ""continue the work that was started by the Clinton Foundation.""

Founded by President Bill Clinton, the foundation has become a major player in international health and global philanthropy. In 2014, the Clinton Foundation reported $439 million in assets and $338 million in revenue, with $217 million spent on programs.

But it has also been heavily criticized for potential conflicts with the State Department under Hillary Clinton's leadership. Released emails have shown some efforts to connect donors or associates at the foundation to personnel at the State Department.

And on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported that as secretary of state, Clinton met or had phone conversations with 154 private citizens — more than half were donors or connected to entities that gave money to the foundation or its projects.

In response, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence called for the foundation to be ""immediately shut down"" and for an ""independent special prosecutor [to] be appointed to determine if access to Hillary Clinton was for sale."" Donald Trump has also called for the foundation to be shut down.

The foundation announced last week that if Hillary Clinton were to be elected, Bill Clinton would step down from the foundation board and it would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate sources. Shalala said Chelsea Clinton would remain on the board.

Shalala insisted the changes are not a reactionary move. ""We're not responding to the outside criticism,"" she said. ""I was brought in a year ago to help start thinking through what the form would take if she was elected, and the president wanted to do it very carefully.""

It would have been ""presumptuous"" to make such changes before Clinton was the nominee, Shalala said.

The Clintons could have avoided conflicts by letting an independent board of directors oversee decisions, said Leslie Lenkowsky of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. But, he said, he hasn't seen any clear evidence that foundation donors got more than small favors from Hillary Clinton's State Department. ""Unless it really gets to affecting public business, you know, it's not nice to look at and the donors shouldn't do it,"" he said. ""But you know, it happens all the time.""

""The most important thing to the president and to Chelsea is that the work continues but under different umbrellas away from the foundation, obviously, because we will not be able to accept corporate donations or international money as we have to support our programs,"" Shalala continued.

Bill Clinton ""will not be involved"" in the initiatives that are spinning off or merging with another foundation, Shalala said. He also would not do any fundraising for the foundation.

So what would remain of the foundation? ""We have some things that are funded by American foundations,"" Shalala said. She also pointed to the presidential library and Clinton center in Little Rock, Ark. ""There are elements of the Clinton Foundation that people often don't think about that stay forever.""

If Clinton wins the election, Bill Clinton will not have any official connection to the foundation, Shalala said, but ""I'm sure he's going to go visit his library."""

We wrote about this last month. The New York Times’ public editor weighed in this week. It’s worth repeating:

When politicians and public officials (or anyone, for that matter) say things that don’t fit the facts, we should point it out – and we are, as the “Break It Down” fact-checks show.

Our earlier post suggested several ways to say and write that what Candidate A or City Official B just said doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. The Times’ Margaret Sullivan pointed to other approaches, such as noting that they spoke “without citing any evidence” or that the statement “has no basis in fact.”

If the evidence shows that a claim clearly doesn’t add up, we don’t need to qualify with a “critics contend” or a “some say.” State what is known and how we’ve reached that conclusion (for example, “an NPR search of news accounts and police records found no evidence to support the claim”).

Sullivan also noted something we agree with: that as much as possible, the fact-checking should be done “in real time.” That is, as soon as possible after a claim is made. We’ve been doing that very effectively after the presidential debates and notable claims by candidates.

Obviously, politicians and public officials aren’t the only people who make claims that can’t be substantiated. Keep in mind that, as the Ethics Handbook says, “our purpose is to pursue the truth. Diligent verification is critical. We take great care to ensure that statements of fact in our journalism are both correct and in context.” Also, we shouldn’t “just spread information. Be careful and skeptical.”

""Chug, chug, chug. Puff, puff, puff. Ding-dong, ding-dong.""

The beloved tale of the little blue engine — who helps bring a broken-down train of toys to the good little boys and girls on the other side of the mountain — has been chugging along for a very long time. But despite the locomotive's optimistic refrain — I think I can, I think I can, I think I can — the story has a somewhat checkered past: In its tracks, The Little Engine has left both a legal battle and a debate over whether the little blue engine is male or female.

The exact origins of the plucky, blue switch engine are a mystery. Variations on the tale have been around for more than 100 years.

""Interestingly, the oldest version of the story I could find was published in 1903 in Sweden,"" says Roy Plotnick, who spent 10 years investigating the little engine's back story as a hobby. (By day, Plotnick is a paleontologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago).

Another version he found appeared in a New York newspaper article in 1906 about a church in Brooklyn that had finally paid off its mortgage after 39 years. The article reported on the minister's sermon: ""They had a mortgage burning,"" says Plotnick, and the minister told a parable that is recognizable as a version of the story of the little engine:

He then went to another great engine and asked: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""It is a very heavy grade,"" it replied. The superintendent was much puzzled, but he turned to still another engine that was spick-and-span new, and he asked it: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""I think I can,"" responded the engine.

The most familiar version of the tale was inspired by a story called ""The Pony Engine"" and published in a children's magazine in 1916 by Massachusetts educator Mabel Bragg. She added new elements to the story including the broken-down train carrying cargo for kids like toys, peppermint drops, and — every child's favorite vegetable — spinach.

The first time The Little Engine That Could was published as a book was in 1930 with the credit ""as retold by Watty Piper,"" a pseudonym for Arnold Munk, who died in 1957. His daughter, Janet Fenton, was never too fond of the pen name.

""I think it's ridiculous, but he seemed to like it so that's what he used,"" says Fenton.

With all of the different versions of the engine story being told in one form or another, small wonder that Munk faced a legal battle. In the 1950s, a woman claimed that it was her cousin — Frances Ford — who wrote the story in 1910. The details of the case were sealed but Fenton says her father prevailed.

""I don't know if he sued somebody or somebody sued him, but he won,"" says Fenton.

Still, publishers of The Little Engine That Could did agree to let another company print an adaptation of Ford's story under the title The Pony Engine.

Now, to the next controversy: Children who read the story may not think much about whether the little blue engine is male or female. But adults do. If you remember the story, three trains — all male — refuse to help the broken-down engine over the mountain. They are too important, too busy, or too tired to pull an engine full of toys. (""I won't carry the likes of you!"" they said to the disappointed dolls and stuffed animals).

The little blue engine who (after significant cajoling) agrees to help is female — and also self-deprecating. ""They only use me for switching trains in the yard. I have never been on the other side of the mountain,"" she protests.

My colleague Beth Novey says that The Little Engine That Could was ""leaning in"" long before Sheryl Sandberg was. Francesco Sedita, president of the Penguin division that publishes The Little Engine That Could, likes the characterization.

She was ""literally the first to lean in! She really is the poster engine of the can-do attitude,"" says Sedita.

Now, over the years, some versions of the little blue engine have been male. And some folks have gotten pretty steamed over the issue. When the engine is a ""she,"" people have assumed the gender was changed to make the story politically correct. But in fact, she was a ""she"" as early as 1930.

Blogger Lara McKusky argues that the little blue engine is a do-it-all, Supermom martyr who is pressured into pulling more than she signed on for — while male trains had no problem setting boundaries and saying no.

Whatever your views on the little blue engine — male or female — the idea of a small train beating the odds through sheer will and determination is so old and so recognizable, it just had to be parodied. In 1976, Saturday Night Live did a bit about a little engine who has a heart attack and dies.

The more innocent, healthier Little Engine turns 85 in 2015."

It Depends On The Tone

When a company, politician or organization won’t comment on something, have they “refused” or “declined?”

“Refused” works, according to Webster’s New World, if the “no” has been “emphatic” or “blunt.” Maybe a phone has been slammed* in your ear or an email has included language we wouldn’t repeat on the air.

But “declined” is the word to go with in most cases. True, the words are close in meaning. But Webster’s notes that to decline is a polite way of refusing. If a spokesman simply says “we’re not going to comment,” that’s a polite response.

Related:

Ina Jaffe was correct this week when she reported that a nursing home had “refused” to readmit a patient. Here’s why: As the BBC notes, “to ‘refuse‘ is the opposite of to ‘accept’ ” and it is done “firmly.” In this case, the hospital said “no” even after being ordered by the state of California to accept the patient. That’s a firm decision.

*In the old days, people had phones that had to be “hung up” to end a call. If you were angry at the person on other end of the line, you might slam the handset (which was attached to a cord) down on the “cradle.” There was also a “dial” on the phone.

J.D. Vance grew up in a Rust Belt town in Ohio, in a family from the hills of eastern Kentucky. His new memoir details the social isolation, poverty and addiction that afflict poor white communities.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, J.D. Vance, is the author of the new best-seller ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir Of A Family And Culture In Crisis."" He says the book is about what goes on in the lives of real people when the industrial economy goes south. He writes about the social isolation, poverty, drug use and the religious and political changes in his family and in greater Appalachia. He grew up in a Rust Belt town in Ohio in a family from the hills of eastern Kentucky. Until the age of 12, he spent summers in Jackson, Ky., with his grandmother and great-grandmother. Vance joined the Marines, which helped him afford college. After attending Ohio State University, he went to Yale Law School where he initially felt completely out of place. He has contributed to the National Review and is now a principal at a Silicon Valley investment firm.

J.D. Vance, welcome to FRESH AIR. There's a paragraph from your new book that I want you to read. It's on Page 2.

J D VANCE: There is an ethnic component lurking in the background of my story. In our race-conscious society, our vocabulary often extends no further than the color of someone's skin - black people, Asians, white privilege. Sometimes these broad categories are useful. But to understand my story, you have to delve into the details.

I may be white, but I do not identify with the WASPs of the Northeast. Instead, I identify with the millions of working-class white Americans of Scots-Irish descent who have no college degree. To these folks, poverty's the family tradition. Their ancestors were day laborers in the southern slave economy, sharecroppers after that, coal miners after that, and machinists and mill workers during more recent times. Americans call them hillbillies, rednecks or white trash. I call them neighbors, friends and family.

GROSS: Thanks for reading that. There's, you know, the line where you make a point of saying that your people were day laborers in the slave economy of the South. Reading between the lines there...

VANCE: Sure.

GROSS: ...What are you saying about class and race with that statement?

VANCE: Well, I guess, I'm not trying to say anything too explicit about race, but to note that poverty just goes back really, really far in the generational stories of these families. So the point I'm trying to make, ultimately, is that these folks have been poor for a very long time. In a lot of ways, intergenerational poverty is something that they inherited and that they've lived with as part of a family tradition. I think part of that means they've grown up with a certain resentment at rich people. But it also means that, for them, the upward mobility that a lot of folks experienced right after World War II was their first real taste of economic optimism, and I think that's something that really gave them a lot of hope. And ultimately, as I write later in the book, that hope didn't really materialize.

GROSS: You know, reading your book, I get the impression that you think - and I think rightfully so - that there's a lot of similarities between what poor people who are white endure in America and what poor people who are black endure in America. Sure, there's differences, too, but there's a lot of things in common. Yet, I'm wondering if you and the people who you grew up with made that connection at all and felt any sense of identification with black people who were your class counterparts.

VANCE: I never thought when I was a kid that there was a sense of competition or animosity towards poor blacks. I just thought there was a recognition that they lived differently - they primarily lived on the other side of town. And we're both poor, but that's kind of it. There wasn't much explicit statement of kinship or of the lack of kinship. Though, I will say there was one really interesting experience I had with my grandma where I started to realize that there was some sort of kinship at least that she felt. And I think I was very lucky to have that exposure to a woman who had lived the life she had but was able to think these thoughts. And what happened is that we were watching a golf tournament. And it was, I believe, the 1997 Masters, where Tiger Woods won.

I was a very young kid, maybe 19 or 20, and the only reason my grandma was watching it was because he was in it. She loved Tiger Woods. And the reason she liked Tiger Woods is because she saw him as an outsider that was shaking up a rich man's game. And there was this really interesting moment where after he won - and the Masters always has this ceremonial winner's dinner to celebrate the victor. One of the golfers said something to the effect of, what are we going to have at the winner's dinner - fried chicken and watermelon, which, of course, was this extraordinarily nasty racist comment.

But it struck me at that moment, one, that that fried chicken and watermelon was almost the cultural food of my people, and my grandma just got so viscerally angry. And she said, those a-holes, they're never going to let people like us be part of their crowd. And the sense that she had was they both looked down on the black people who were outsiders and the poor, white people who are outsiders. And she really saw the similarities. And that was the first real exposure that she felt some sort of kinship to people who looked very different from her but ultimately were similar in a lot of ways.

GROSS: Your family is from Jackson, Ky. And your grandparents moved to southwestern Ohio after that. But you spent a lot of time in Jackson growing up. Would you describe what that community was like physically and also just what it was like as a community?

VANCE: Jackson, Ky., is in southeastern Kentucky coal country. And it's this extraordinarily beautiful part of the Appalachian Mountains - pretty big hills, pretty severe, harsh landscape, but also just a very beautiful town with very beautiful people. It's about 6,000 people. There are only a couple of stoplights in town. There are maybe a few restaurants, most of them are fast-food restaurants. And the people are these extraordinarily sweet people who love the land and also love the people that they grew up around.

And when I was a kid, the first time I realized that there was something really unique about Jackson and its people, as I write in the book - there was a funeral motorcade passing by. And my grandma said, we have to get out. We have to stand at attention. And I said, you know, why, Mamaw (ph)? Why are we all doing this? Why does everybody stop and stand at attention when a funeral motorcade passes? And she said because, honey, we're hill people, and we respect our dead. And it made me realize that there was something very important about this identity of hill people that both my grandma and the rest of Jacksonians took on as a certain, you know, as a certain self-identifier.

GROSS: So you write that you consider your family part of a greater migration from Appalachia to Ohio. What is that period of migration that you're writing about? What is that larger wave that you feel your family is part of?

VANCE: So there were two big waves of migration - one right after World War I, the second right after World War II. And my grandparents were part of that second wave where literally millions of people moved from the hills of eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, eastern Tennessee into southern Ohio, into Michigan, into northern Ohio, Pennsylvania and so forth. And in many ways, the white part of the Rust Belt economy was really filled with these Appalachian migrants. There are various studies that suggest that at any given time, at least 30 percent of the population of some of these Rust Belt counties were directly from Appalachia. And of course, that doesn't count that the kids and grandchildren of the Appalachian migrants.

And so there was this sense, in southern Ohio especially - we called our hometown of Middletown Middletucky (ph) because so many of the residents actually came from Kentucky. There was a massive family-based recruiting program that brought migrants from eastern Kentucky into the southern Ohio steel mill where my grandpa worked. So it was this massive transplantation of one culture and one group of people into an entirely different area. And a lot of times, of course, they kept the culture, and they kept a lot of their habits with them when they moved.

GROSS: Yes. You write that a lot of the people who move from Appalachia to Ohio kept the culture. But your grandparents, you say, brought an ancient family structure from the hills and tried to make it work in a world of privacy and nuclear families, and it didn't quite fit. Would you explain?

VANCE: Sure. So in Appalachia, in eastern Kentucky, these families are extraordinarily large. And they're built on an extended network of kin. So grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles, cousins - they're all a part of the mix. And they all, ultimately, I think, are involved in family life in a way that's a little bit different from upper-income white people from the Northeast, for example.

And what I think my grandparents found when they moved north is that they didn't have quite that extended network of kin that so many of their people back in eastern Kentucky depended upon. So there was no grandma or grandpa to look after the kids. There wasn't help from aunts and uncles.

And I think my grandparents really struggled in a lot of ways without that big, extended family network that they had become so dependent upon and so reliant upon. It's really sad in a lot of ways because I think - you know, this is a slight aside.

But a lot of the modern social welfare state is built around a nuclear family. So when a kid enters a foster care system, for example, they're presented with an opportunity to go live with a licensed foster care parent or to stay with their parent, who's potentially abusive or neglectful. That's why they're in that situation in the first place.

And a lot of times, these child welfare bureaucracies ignore these extended networks of kin that are really important to these children's lives. And so that's one of the things I found when I was a kid - is that I wasn't really given an opportunity by the child welfare worker to go and live with mamaw and papaw, which is what I wanted to do.

What I was given - an opportunity was to either shut up or to go live with a complete stranger. And so it's not just that my grandparents, I think, were culturally disconnected from the modern WASPy nuclear family. But in a lot of ways, the broader community of Appalachians was thrust into a world that respected a different family structure than the one they came from.

GROSS: Why were you almost put in a foster home when you were 12 years old?

VANCE: So what happened is my mom, who was, in a lot of ways, this really wonderful person who tried very hard but also carried around the demons of her youth a little too much - she had come over to my grandma's house where I was staying. She had apologized for something she had done earlier. And she had offered to take me on this trip to go and do some fun things.

And it was supposed to be a big makeup trip. But what happened is that something ignited her temper while we were together. She sped up the car on the highway. Went over - you know, it seemed at the time like she was driving over 100 mph. And she just kept on saying, I'm going to crash this car and kill us both. I'm going to crash this car and kill us both.

And so what I did is hopped in the backseat to hide from her. And this got her really angry. And she stopped the car and pulled over and, I think, was going to start hitting me. And so I ran. I ran out of the car. We were in a pretty rural part of the state. And I actually ran through a field to a person's house.

And eventually, this set in chain a set of events where mom was arrested. She was charged with domestic violence. And I was made to sit in a police car until my grandparents and my sister came to rescue me. But that's what invited the child welfare bureaucracy into our lives - is that as soon as she was charged with domestic violence, it became a case of child abuse and neglect.

And I was effectively given a choice between - keep talking, and we're going to have to file charges, and we're going to have to take you out of the home - on the one hand. Or if you just keep quiet about things, then you can stay living with your family. And that was, of course, a pretty hard decision for a 12-year-old.

But luckily, I had enough faith in my grandma. I knew that she wouldn't let anything too bad happen to me. And so I lied to the people who asked whether something bad had happened. I remember my mom had a domestic violence hearing. And the judge asked whether she had done anything to threaten me. And I lied. I told him no because I knew that if I kept on pushing the case, one, it would cause a lot of problems for the family. And two, it might land me in a foster home.

GROSS: How did you feel about lying? You're always taught not to lie. And here you are at a hearing, lying. And you think it's for your good and your family's good. Nevertheless, it's a lie.

VANCE: The honest truth is that I didn't care at all about lying because I remember sitting in that courtroom and feeling in some ways that I was on the wrong side of an invisible line because the lawyers and the judge - they all talked a certain way. They all wore certain clothes. And I felt like they were outsiders.

They were the people that I was taught, in some way, to mistrust and to fear. They were rich people - whether they were actually rich - they seemed rich to me. And I noticed that in this little courtroom, all of the people who were subjected to the court system were like me. They were white people. They didn't wear that nice of clothes.

They were obviously very poor, both in the way that they talked and the way that they conducted themselves. And when I was asked to lie to that judge, frankly, I didn't feel bad at all because I knew that it was something that was necessary to protect my family and to protect myself.

And it's really interesting, looking back, that I didn't, you know - I'm a member of the bar now - that I didn't feel at all guilty about lying to a judge. And a big part of it is just because I felt like - look, my people are here. And they're being subjected to this system. These people are over there. And they're administering this system. And it's fine to tell a little white lie to them. And that's, of course, a little ironic because I was there, theoretically, because of my own protection.

But it was pretty clear to me, both in my exposure to the courthouse and my exposure to the child welfare bureaucracy, that the folks who were involved in our lives were outsiders. And what was most important was to push them out as quickly as possible.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is J.D. Vance. He's the author of the new best-selling memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir Of A Family And A Culture In Crisis."" Let's take a short break. And we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is J.D. Vance, author of the new best-selling memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir Of A Family And Culture In Crisis."" And his family is from Kentucky and moved to Ohio. His grandparents moved to Ohio to a steel town there - what he calls now a Rust Belt town. So this is the story about his family and the larger story of Appalachian poverty.

Your grandfather was an alcoholic for many years. Your mother was addicted to various drugs for many years. And the way you describe it in your book, it sounds like both the area of Ohio where your family lived in and the area of Kentucky where they're from ended up having a lot of alcohol and drug problems there - drugs including heroin and opioids.

VANCE: That's absolutely right. And it's maybe even worse in southern Ohio than it is in eastern Kentucky, though it's certainly terrible in both. I saw a statistic a few weeks ago that in the Ohio county where I grew up, Butler County, deaths from drug overdoses actually outnumber deaths from natural causes. And that's just an extraordinary statistic. I don't know that that's ever been true in that area. It certainly hasn't been true in recent history.

And it goes to show how really rooted this opioid epidemic is. It's something that everyone thinks about and talks about. You see signs about support groups whenever you go back to these areas. And it's just an extraordinarily terrible thing that's happened to these communities. And I'm not sure that there's a super easy solution for how to get out of it.

GROSS: Do you feel like you saw it start to happen and then build?

VANCE: Absolutely. I definitely - in a lot of ways, I was at the ground floor of the opioid epidemic because I saw it happening with my mom before it had really reached crisis proportions. But in a lot of ways, she was just responding to the things that cause people to go and search for drugs in the first place.

She was a person, I think, who carried around a lot of emotional baggage, a lot of emotional turmoil and hurt from her own childhood. And so she turned to drugs. But a lot of people have done the same, of course, in the past five or 10 years, which is why these addiction rates - which is why these overdose rates are so high in these communities.

GROSS: What was your attitude towards drinking and drugs when you were growing up and seeing how it affected your grandfather, seeing how it affected your mother?

VANCE: Well, growing up as a young child, I think that I had attitudes pretty similar to a lot of kids, which is just, say no to drugs. These things are bad for you. They're immoral and so forth. But as I grew older, I started to be attracted, frankly, to the kids who were doing drugs, to the possibility of having a bit of an escape from a very chaotic and very troubling home life.

And so by the time I was 13 or 14, I was hanging out with kids who were doing drugs. And I was even starting to experiment myself. And it's funny that my grandma - she was so perceptive that she recognized that I was starting to do these things and that they were becoming a problem, I think, much earlier than a lot of kids' parents would have.

GROSS: What did she do when she realized it?

VANCE: (Laughter) Well, the first time she realized that I was hanging out with the wrong kids, she actually told me in a very menacing voice, look J.D., I'll give you a choice. You can either stop hanging out with these kids, or I'll run them over with my car.

GROSS: (Laughter).

VANCE: And trust me, no one will ever find out. And I don't think she would've actually run over 12 or 13-year-old kids with her car. But I sure thought she would. And so I actually did stop hanging out with the kids she told me I couldn't hang out with. A lot of kids don't listen to that demand when their parents make it. But I was so terrified of mamaw that I listened and listened good.

GROSS: I'm just thinking about the violence in your family. Your mother threatened to crash the car to kill both of you. You thought she might actually attack you. Your grandmother threatened to, like, run down the guys you were hanging out with. And you believed that she had it in her to do that.

Your mother was always - sounds like she was always arguing - and I mean, like, fighting, arguing with her husband - she had several of them - and her boyfriends. It seems to me you grew up in an atmosphere where violence was always a possibility, even among people who are supposed to love each other.

VANCE: That's absolutely true. Violence and chaos were an ever present part of the world that I grew up in. And unfortunately, it wasn't just in my family. Sometimes, you'd see, you know, mom fighting with one of her boyfriends. But a lot of times, you'd see people exploding on each other in a local restaurant or on the street. It was just this ever present part of the world that I grew up in.

And it's interesting that all of the people that I talk about in my book that grew up in this chaos that ended up having successful home lives and successful marriages - they married an outsider.

They married someone like I did who didn't grow up with these lessons, who didn't grow up with these experiences, and because of that, knew how to manage the people that they were married to and knew how to not respond in kind. As I write in the book, you put two of me in the same marriage, and I don't think it works.

But you put one of me, who's maybe a little self-reflective, in a marriage with somebody who hasn't faced that trauma - then I think you have a good chance. And that's one of the lessons of my life.

GROSS: My guest is J.D. Vance, author of the new book ""Hillbilly Elegy."" After we take a short break, we'll talk about what the conversation is like with family and friends when the subject turns to Donald Trump. And Ken Tucker will review the new album by the bluegrass group The Earls of Leicester, which pays tribute to Earl Flatt and Lester Scruggs. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with J.D. Vance, author of the new best-seller ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir Of A Family And Culture In Crisis."" He writes about the social isolation, poverty and religious and political changes in his family and in greater Appalachia. He grew up in a Rust Belt town in Ohio in a family from the hills of eastern Kentucky, where he spent summers when he was a boy.

Christianity was a presence in your life. But you say church wasn't that important. Your grandmother had a deeply personal faith. But she saw churches as breeding grounds for perverts and money changers. So what was the gap between faith and church?

VANCE: Absolutely. That was a really important part of my life. And so my grand - my - you know, Mamaw taught a very personal faith. She really loved the Christian faith. She loved God, and that was an important part of her life. But she was disconnected from a traditional religious institution. And it's interesting that we hear so much about how religion and evangelical faith is really important in these communities. But if you actually look at the statistics, lower-income Americans are increasingly less likely to go to church. So church is increasingly the province of upper-income and well-educated folks, despite a lot of the stereotypes that exist around religion.

The problem, of course, is that children who go to church, they are less likely to commit crimes, less likely to do drugs. And there's some really good evidence by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber that this relationship is causal. So in this world where a lot of things are falling apart, church can be a really important backstop, but less and less people are going to church. And that was certainly something that was true in my life.

GROSS: Your grandparents were both religious. They were deeply Christian. Why didn't they go to church?

VANCE: So there were a couple of reasons, I think. So one is that Mamaw just mistrusted a lot of the parts of institutional Christianity as she saw it. She saw that people were primarily asking for money and weren't actually that interested in the faith. And the other side of it - and I think that this is related - is that Mamaw saw church as increasingly an upper-crust institution.

There were a lot of churches in Middletown, Ohio, but there weren't a lot of churches in the very poor, white communities. They were typically in the wealthier suburbs. They were typically in the better-educated suburbs, the parts of Middletown where people were doing a little bit better off. And in some ways, I think Mamaw's approach to church was a leading indicator of what we're seeing a lot these days, which is that lower-income folks don't feel as comfortable in church and don't have as much exposure to church.

GROSS: Your father, who you lived with very briefly, was one of the few conservative Protestants you knew who attended church regularly. And when you briefly lived with him, you went to his church. And you were exposed to things like not believing in evolution. You say there was a big emphasis on the war against Christmas, as it's called (laughter), remarks about the gay lobby.

VANCE: Sure.

GROSS: So how did you how did you interpret that when you were exposed to - are those ideas that - like, did your grandmother not talk about the gay lobby? Was that not a part of her Christian view?

VANCE: No, she definitely didn't. And I think that was a big part of the modern fusion of conservative politics and evangelical Christianity. And because she was not part of a modern church, I don't think she ever picked up the rhetoric, some of the more political rhetoric of conservative Christianity. The juxtaposition between my dad's church's social importance and its teachings is really fascinating to me.

So on the one hand, my dad's church provided a lot of moral pressure, a good community of believers that really supported me and supported him. And that was really important, and it was really great, full of the best people, honestly, that I've ever known. But on the other hand, there was this sense that the outside world was starting to gang up on Christians. There was - you know, evolution was a lie that the devil told to get Christians to believe in modern science. There was a feeling that the gay lobby was making it more and more difficult for Christians to live their lives or to practice their faith - that it was impossible to speak your faith in the public square.

And all of this stuff taken together really meant that we felt isolated from the larger community. To be a Christian, in a lot of ways, meant to feel a certain mistrust for the broader community. And that has really problematic consequences because I needed church. I needed a lot of the good things that church provided. But as I grew older, it became increasingly hard for me to rationalize the importance of church in my life with the beliefs that it required that were at odds with modern science.

GROSS: Did you ever subscribe to those beliefs that are at odds with modern science or subscribe to the homophobia that you were taught in church?

VANCE: Absolutely. I used to go on chat rooms on AOL, back when those things existed, and argue with believers in evolution and argued with them that it was against God's law to believe in evolution. It was something I believed really personally. But as you grow up and you're exposed to more and more people from different walks of life and you realize that evolution is just a scientific truth - it doesn't necessarily have much to do with the Bible one way or the other - you start to realize that there are real conflicts in your church. And it makes it hard to believe that you can be a good Christian if you don't necessarily believe the teachings, all the way, of the church.

So it creates this conflict in people where you want to believe in modern science, but you also want to be a good Christian. And a lot of people can't do both at the same time in a very politicized, very conservative sort of Christianity.

GROSS: You read the ""Left Behind"" books when you were a teenager. And those are books - those are novels written by, you know, a Christian fundamentalist who - and the novels are about the rapture and about the tribulations after the good Christians are raised up to heaven and everybody else is left behind. As I recall, the devil, in at least the first installment of the ""Left Behind"" books, the great Satan is the head of the United Nations. So...

VANCE: (Laughter).

GROSS: ...Like, did you buy into that?

VANCE: That's exactly right. And I even remember, as a kid, wondering if Kofi Annan might be the Antichrist because he was then the secretary-general of the United Nations, when those books came out. But it's part-and-parcel of this idea that there's a war against Christians, this sense that the world is hopelessly corrupt, that institutions like the United Nations are going to produce the Antichrist. And when you are exposed to that sort of message, it is hard to simultaneously be a Christian but also engage meaningfully with the modern world.

GROSS: You really thought Kofi Annan might be the the great Satan?

VANCE: I was 12 years old, and it definitely crossed my mind. We would sit around and talk about where - you know, where is the Antichrist going to come from? Maybe it's Kofi Annan. Maybe it's - you know, it was definitely a conversation that we had. And of course, I don't know many secretary-generals of the United Nations. But I remember Kofi Annan because he was such a prominent part of my thinking when I was that age because yeah, I did think maybe this guy could be the Antichrist.

GROSS: I always wonder what impact thinking that the rapture is about to happen has on a child growing up because, on the one hand, if it's going to be the end of the world, like, why not do whatever you want? You know, like, why not get the instant gratification while the world still lasts, right? But on the other hand, if you do the wrong thing, you're not going to be raptured and you're going to be left behind to face the tribulation. So, you know, you're facing, like, two extreme choices there because you believe in an extreme and an immediate extreme.

VANCE: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And what's interesting about it is that you don't prepare for a material future when you think that you're going to be raptured. I had a friend who, no kidding, said he was going to take on as much debt as he wanted in college because he thought the rapture would happen before he had to pay it back. And, of course, that's not a really good way to go through life, if you're trying to live an upwardly mobile American life, is to think that, on the one hand, you need to be a good Christian and worry about how you're going to live your life - that's very important - but on the other hand, you can make as many terrible financial decisions as you want to because you'll never have to face the consequences of them.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is J.D. Vance. He's the author of the new memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir Of A Family And Culture In Crisis."" Let's take another short break and then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is J.D. Vance, author of the new book ""Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir Of A Family And Culture In Crisis."" He writes about the social isolation, poverty, drug use, as well as religious and political changes in his family and in Greater Appalachia.

You describe yourself as conservative, and you've written for The National Review, a conservative magazine. You've become kind of famous for an article or two in which you try to explain why, you know, a lot of poor people would be voting for Trump. And in your writing and in your discussions, you've called Trump's promises the needle in America's collective vein. You've described Trump as the new pain reliever, trying to make comparisons between, you know, narcotisizing (ph) pain and what Trump is trying to do in explaining things away, easy solutions. Do you know a lot of people who are going to be voting for Trump or - yeah.

VANCE: I do. A lot of people in my family are going to be voting for Trump, a lot of my neighbors and friends from back home. So it's definitely a phenomenon I, I think, recognize and frankly saw coming pretty early. You know, it's interesting that I don't think the Trump phenomenon is exclusively about the white poor.

I think that it's more about the white working-class folks who aren't necessarily economically destitute but in some ways feel very culturally isolated and very pessimistic about the future. That's one of the biggest predictors of whether someone will support Donald Trump - it may be the biggest predictor - is the belief that America is headed in the wrong direction, the belief that your kids are not going to have a better life than you did.

And that cynicism really breeds frustration at political elites, but, frankly, that frustration needs to find a better outlet than Donald Trump. And that's why I've made some of the analogies that I have because I don't think that he's going to make the problem better. I think, like you said, he is in some ways a pain reliever. He's someone who makes people feel a little bit better about their problems. But whether he's elected president or not, those problems are still going to be there, and we've got to recognize that.

GROSS: So when you're having a discussion about the presidential race with someone in your family, someone who's going to be voting for Trump, what is that conversation like?

VANCE: It typically starts with me making a point that I just made, which is, look, maybe Trump is recognizing some legitimate problems. He's talking about the opioid epidemic in a way that nobody else is. But he's not going to fix the problem. You know, better trade deals is not going to make all of these problems just go away.

And typically my family actually recognizes that. That's what I find so interesting. They don't think that this guy is going to solve all their problems. They just think he's at least trying and he's saying things, primarily to the elites, that they wish they could say themselves. So it's really interesting. There's a recognition that Trump isn't going to solve a lot of these problems, but he's, at the end of the day, the only person really trying to tap into this frustration.

And it's, you know, I - so my dad is a Trump supporter, and I love my dad, and I always say, Dad, you know, Trump is not going to actually make any of these problems better. And he says, well, that's probably true, but at least he's talking about them and nobody else is and at least he's not Mitt Romney. At least he's not George W. Bush. He's at least trying to talk about these problems.

And I think it's amazing how low the bar has been set by the political conversation we've had for the past 20 or 30 years that this guy, who many people don't think is going to solve the problems, is still getting a lot of support from people who are blue-collar white folks.

GROSS: I think a lot of people are mystified that working-class people would find anything to relate to in somebody whose accent might sound working class but was born into wealth and has, you know, is a billionaire if you, you know, listen to what he says about his net worth and who has, you know, like, you know, gold all over his many properties. I mean, there's - he's - it's such an extravagantly flaunting it rich lifestyle that he leads. Like, it's always a little hard to understand why somebody who so strongly identifies as working class would think that somehow he'd be able to best represent their interests.

VANCE: I certainly understand why a lot of folks are surprised. I think a big part of it is just the way that Donald Trump conducts himself. A lot of people feel that you can't trust anything Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama say, not because they necessarily lied a lot but because they sound so filtered and they sound so rehearsed. Donald Trump, if nothing else, is relatable to the average working-class American because he speaks off the cuff. He's clearly unfiltered and unrehearsed.

And there is something relatable about that, even if, you know, half of the things that he says don't make any sense or a quarter of the things that he says are offensive. There's something to be said about relatability. And it's not, you know - there's been a lot written about how elite political conversation is not emotionally relatable to big chunks of the country. I think that in a lot of ways, Trump is just the first person to tap into that sense of disconnect in the way that he conducts himself with politics.

GROSS: So, as a conservative who thinks that Trump does not have the answers and isn't qualified to be president...

VANCE: Sure.

GROSS: ...What are you going to do this election, if you don't mind saying?

VANCE: My current plan is to vote either third party or, as I joked to my wife, I might write in my dog because that's about as good as it seems. But, you know, I think there's a chance, if I feel like Trump has a really good chance of winning, that I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton. But at the end of the day, I just feel like she is so culturally disconnected from the people that I grew up around that it would be very, very hard for me to cast my ballot for her. So ultimately I think I'll probably vote third party. I might vote for this new guy who I really like, Evan McMullin, who I actually met the other day. But I think that I'm going to vote third party because I can't stomach Trump. I think that he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place. And ultimately I just don't share Hillary Clinton's politics.

GROSS: I'm just curious, though, in terms of the cultural difference you see between your life and the Clintons' - like, Hillary Clinton's mother was, I think, poor. Bill Clinton had a single mother who was somewhere between poor and working class. They have a lot of money now. You have a lot of money now.

VANCE: Yeah. So I think that there are obviously a lot of things that are relatable about Hillary and Bill Clinton. But fundamentally, they've surrounded themselves by very elite people who went to very elite universities. And because of that, both in the way they conduct themselves and the things they seem to care about - they just seem very different from the people that I grew up around. And that makes it very hard for me to feel that Clinton - Hillary or Bill Clinton are very relatable.

GROSS: The title of your memoir is ""Hillbilly Elegy."" What do you think of the word hillbilly? It's often used as a pejorative expression. You say people you know call themselves that.

VANCE: Yeah, I think it's an insider's term. It's something that my grandma once told me, we're allowed to call ourselves hillbillies - and we did - but nobody else is allowed to call us hillbillies. So it's very much a term of endearment for the people who use it about themselves and their families. But it's definitely pejorative and it's definitely the sort of term where if someone called me a hillbilly and meant it seriously, I'd be very, very offended.

GROSS: I want to thank you so much for talking with us.

VANCE: Yeah, Terry, thank you so much for having me. I really enjoyed chatting with you.

GROSS: J.D. Vance is the author of the new memoir, ""Hillbilly Elegy."" After we take a short break, Ken Tucker will review the new album by the bluegrass group The Earls of Leicester which pays tribute to Earl Flatt and Lester Scruggs. This is FRESH AIR.

The U.S. could rein in rising drug prices by being more selective about giving patents to pharmaceutical companies for marginal developments, a study concludes.

That's because brand-name drugs with patents that grant exclusivity account for about 72 percent of drug spending, even though they are only about 10 percent of all prescriptions dispensed, according to the study, published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.

""You've got a bunch of different tactics that are being used that can extend that exclusivity,"" says Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the study's lead author.



He says the patent office is too permissive in granting patents for drug properties that have no bearing on its therapeutic value.

Under the current law, new chemically based medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration get the right to sell their drugs with no competition from generics for five to seven years. More complex biologic drugs get 12 years of protection.

But drugmakers can also use their patents to keep competitors out of the market.

The study found that new drugs have a median 12.5 years of exclusive market access, and it's even longer for completely new medications.

Kesselheim says drugmakers often use ""life-cycle management"" tactics to extend their exclusive market access.

He pointed to a cholesterol drug named Tricor-1 as an example. The medication was made by Abbott Labs. When a company applied to make a generic version, Abbott sued, delaying the competitor's entry to the market, according to an account excerpted in the blog The Incidental Economist.

As the lawsuit proceeded, Abbott changed the dosage of the drug, named it Tricor-2, and aggressively moved patients to the new version. When the generic version of Tricor-1 was finally approved, very few people were taking it anymore.

Kesselheim says the patent office is charged with protecting inventions that are ""novel, useful and non-obvious,"" but that it has been lax in interpreting those parameters. If patents were harder to get on nonessential properties of medications, there would likely be more competition sooner.

""We did a study a while back and found one HIV medication has over 100 different patents covering formulations and crystal structures and methods of use,"" he says.

Drugmakers often argue that high prices help them recoup the costs of developing new drugs. But the JAMA study found no relationship between development costs and profits on medications.

Still, the patent system does give companies incentives to take risks on new medications, says Jacob Sherkow, a professor of law at New York Law School.

""Companies spend billions of dollars researching drugs and ushering them through FDA approval,"" Sherkow says. ""They wouldn't do that unless they could charge supercompetitive prices to make up for those investments.""

Patents aren't the only price reduction tool available to the government.

The JAMA study concludes that if Medicare and other government programs were allowed to refuse to cover some medications, that may also put downward pressure on prices.

The health care program for the elderly and disabled buys about one-third of the prescription drugs sold in the U.S. But the federal law that created the Medicare prescription drug program bars it from negotiating for lower prices, while requiring it to cover almost all drugs on the market. Medicaid is also required to pay for all FDA-approved drugs.

Ameet Sarpatwari, a study co-author, says the lack of information on drugs' prices and effectiveness makes it hard for government programs and consumers to compare them.

""Those comparisons need to be done, and that information needs to be disseminated,"" he says."

Early mornings are routine for 69-year-old Hiroyuko Yamamoto. He's typically at a busy intersection in the city of Matsudo, near Tokyo, where he volunteers as a school crossing guard. But one rainy morning a little over a year ago, an old woman caught his attention.

She was pushing a bicycle. She was kind of disheveled. Despite the rain, she didn't have an umbrella. When Yamamoto spoke to the woman, she said she was trying to get to the city of Kamisuwa. That's about four hours away by train.

Yamamoto recognized that the woman had several signs of dementia he'd learned about when he took his city's dementia awareness training.

Yamamoto volunteers with Matsudo's Orange Patrol. The organization's formal name in Japanese — Olenji koe kake tai — translates awkwardly into English as ""Troop that calls out to the elderly."" But the name accurately describes what the members do. Yamamoto says that just a simple, ""Hello, what a nice day,"" can tell you if someone is OK or needs help.

Because of his training, Yamamoto says, he knew how to talk with the old woman pushing the bicycle.

""I talked to her about things that, according to the training manual, would not upset her,"" he says. ""And I spoke in a gentle manner."" These things helped him persuade the woman to stay with him until the police arrived about 20 minutes later.

If it hadn't been for her chance encounter with Yamamoto, the woman might have gone missing, or worse. Last year, 12,208 people with dementia were reported missing to the National Police Agency in Japan. Most were found alive within a week. But 479 were found dead, and 150 were never found.

These numbers have been increasing every year as the number of older people in Japan continues to rise. Nearly 27 percent of the Japanese population is now 65 or older. And, as the number of older people grows, so does the number of people with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. The Japanese government expects that by 2025 more than 7 million of the nation's residents will have dementia.

A comprehensive plan for dealing with that expected rise in dementia cases was passed by the national government last year. But Matsudo has been providing dementia awareness training for city residents since 2010. Thousands of people have taken it.

Atsuko Yoshioka conducts dementia awareness classes for the city of Matsudo. She says the sessions are brief — just 60 to 90 minutes — so she tries to customize the content for students.

For example, pharmacist Takayuki Yoshida says he sometimes had clients who ""even after I gave the medication to them, they'd come back and say they didn't get the drugs."" Now he knows that may be a sign of dementia, and he contacts the patient's doctor.

Many post office workers have also taken the training. In Japan, post offices also conduct some banking transactions. Hiroki Yaita says sometimes an older client will come in several times to say that someone has stolen their bankbook. Now, because of the training, ""we would think that maybe that person has dementia and we would talk to the family about that possibility.""

The purpose of the training isn't to make Matsudo residents experts in dementia, says Tadashi Watanabe, chief of the city's Welfare and Longevity Department. The goal, he says, is just ""to support those with dementia, as well as their families, and make this a town where it's more comfortable for them to live.""

Some communities in the United States have begun similar programs. And in Japan what's been going on in Matsudo is now national policy. The comprehensive plan adopted by the government last year includes research and prevention and nursing services. It also includes a campaign for increasing dementia awareness among the general public. The country is on track to train 8 million people by the end of the next fiscal year.

Hidenori Kawashima, deputy director for dementia policy in Japan's Ministry of Labor, Health, and Welfare, says the expected rise in dementia cases should not be seen as a threat. Interacting with people with dementia will become normal.

""It would be a familiar thing,"" says Kawashima. ""So we wanted the plan: First, to create a structure in the local communities to support those with dementia and, second, to create a society where it will be natural for them to live.""

No government plan can keep people with dementia from wandering. But health officials in Japan hope there eventually will be entire communities prepared to help keep them safe, if and when they do."

Courtney Marie Andrews, 'Rookie Dreaming'

from Honest Life

Somehow, between being born in Arizona in 1990 and moving to Washington in 2011, singer, songwriter and guitarist Courtney Marie Andrews seems to have spent time in early-'70s Laurel Canyon. Her new, self-produced album Honest Life is evidence; while she keeps company with some wonderful contemporary artists, Andrews channels classic icons beautifully. The throwback-folk perfection of the opening track, ""Rookie Dreaming,"" is typical of the entire collection. With an unhurried lyrical cadence set against a sparse sonic backdrop, Andrews sets the scene of what has been: ""I was a 1960s movie / I was a one-night love story / I was a 'You will never see me again.'"" Here, the singer gazes into a pool of self-reflection, looking earnestly for reckoning and redemption. Three minutes later, shuffling drums and stacked vocals have come and gone as she flips the script to what she's become: ""I am a 1960s movie / I am an unwritten story / I am a 'When will I see you again?'"" Musing her way through the evolution, she emerges with new-found maturity as she confesses the transgressions behind her: ""I was too broke, too shallow to dive deep / Too busy carrying the weight of everything.""

The Hike by Drew Magary Hardcover, 278 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

You know what they don't make a lot of? Summer beach books for dudes.

I mean, okay. If you like crime novels, sure. There are always 10,000 of those slumping on the shelves. Military techno/spy WE-ONLY-HAVE-24-HOURS-TO-SAVE-THE-KENTUCKY-DERBY-FROM-ESKIMO-TERRORISTS!-style thrillers? Yeah, I guess there are some of those, too.

But what I'm saying here is that there aren't enough books with hovercrafts. With dwarf-fights. Books for guys who don't care about the specific technical details of the next generation of main battle tanks, but do have bad knees and softening guts, families, jobs, and the vague feeling that somewhere along the way we gave up something big that we didn't understand for a small victory we understand even less.

Here's the good news: Now there is one. It's called The Hike and it's written by Drew Magary (who you might know from GQ, from Deadspin, or from his appearance on the cooking show Chopped, where he played the part of a doofus in a polo shirt so perfectly that it's like he really is just some doofus in a polo shirt). He's the guy who makes fun of your favorite football teams online. Who gleefully destroys children's programming in essays full of bad words and excellent analogies. Who has already written a couple other books, but has now turned his hand to deconstructing (and then maybe having a few drinks and a half-tab of acid before re-constructing) the traditional fairy tale for this weird, modern age in which we live.

It begins with Ben — a man who has a job that's so boring I can't even recall exactly what it was. Ben is 38. He has a wife and three kids in Maryland, but as the tale opens, he has come to a faded country hotel in rural Pennsylvania for some sort of business meeting.

More Drew Magary

He arrives early (because Ben is the kind of guy who would do that) and checks in and decides to go for a short hike (because Ben is also the kind of guy who would do that). Not a run. He's a bit past that. But just a little walk in the woods.

Which is when his entire universe comes un-stuck at the seams.

First thing I loved about The Hike? It happens so fast, this unsticking. And when that moment comes, it's brutal.

""And then he saw the man: a big, hulking man wearing a denim shirt and cheap jeans, dragging a body out of the shed. The corpse was small and clad in a little cupcake nightgown. Her feet were gone.""

It goes on. It gets worse. It is precisely as shocking and disorienting as it's supposed to be. There's a chase, a great and believable narrow escape, panic, tears, barfing, a giant cricket.

Yes, a giant cricket. Ben has to fight one. In the attic of a creepy, empty house in the middle of nowhere. With a cheese knife. And that isn't even the weirdest thing that happens on that page because after the cricket comes the talking, grumpy, foul-mouthed crab (named Crab) who becomes Ben's only friend.

What Magary is playing with here (beyond fairy tales, beyond an 8-bit videogame structure of puzzle-item-reward that is predictable but as nostalgically comforting as the shape of a Nintendo controller in the hand) are themes of regret, resilience and dedication.

What Magary is playing with here (beyond fairy tales, beyond an 8-bit videogame structure of puzzle-item-reward that is predictable but as nostalgically comforting as the shape of a Nintendo controller in the hand) are themes of regret, resilience and dedication. There is a path. Ben has to stay on it or he will die. There's an ambiguous promise that if he does this, he will (someday) make it back to his wife and children. Nothing else is given, or even offered (except the occasional lobster dinner).

And look, the whole thing is wildly uneven and sometimes frustratingly basic. There's a drooping middle segment that would've worked fine as a second-act training montage in an eighties movie, but dragged things down on the page. But still, The Hike just works. It's like early, good Chuck Pahlaniuk leeched of all bitterness and class warfare — back when Chuck was still weird and tired and furious. It's like a story you tell yourself on a long drive alone in the dark. It's fun and fast and bizarre, familiar yet completely other.

But the real kicker? Magary underhands a twist in at the end that hits you like a sharp jab at the bell. You'll see stars, I promise, but I don't want to come within a million miles of spoiling for you. It's just that good.

So like Ben, you're just going to have to earn it by getting to the end of the path yourself.

Editor's note: This interview contains adult themes, including a discussion of sexual assault.

Amy Schumer is tired of answering a question journalists ask her all the time: Is this a good moment for women in Hollywood?

""It is an amazing moment for every woman,"" she tells NPR's David Greene, ""if you have ovaries and you're in the 90210 ZIP code.""

One reason Schumer hates that question: She's a New Yorker. The other? She thinks women generally have it tough all the time. And speaking up — about sex, gender stereotypes, crazy, unrealistic expectations for women and their appearance — is a signature of her comedy.

Schumer was already a comedy star the last time she spoke to NPR a few years ago. Then, last year, Trainwreck — the movie she wrote and starred in, somewhat inspired by her own life — was a hit. And she got really famous.

Now, she's written a memoir, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo (and, yes, she has one).

Like her comedy, the book is revealing. She shares excerpts from her personal diaries going back to her preteen years, complete with footnotes from present-day Amy (young Amy dreamed of living in New York and making money acting and bartending, all of which she's done).

Schumer says she always knew she was funny. ""I only remember loving making people laugh. And making myself laugh.""

Interview Highlights

On being a comedian and an introvert

I think standup is pretty good for an introvert, because you are performing, but, I mean, it's on your own terms. There are so many people in the room, but it's a one-sided conversation. And you actually don't have to interact, unless you want to. ... I don't want to pull the curtain back, but comedians do want laughs. That is the goal. Being introverted, it doesn't mean necessarily being shy or being afraid of public speaking, it just means that it's hard for me to interact with people for too long.

On writing about being sexually assaulted (Schumer says she had fallen asleep and woke to find her boyfriend having sex with her without her consent)

Talking about this in the book, it's a lot and it's risky, and then people say, ""You didn't use the word rape."" People ... they just want a pull quote. They want clickbait. And so just talking about being sexually assaulted in any way, you know, for women, it's never like, ""Oh, I'm really sorry that happened to you."" Which is really how it should be, and how you would think it would be. But it's more, we look for problems we have with how that woman has spoken about her sexual assault.

I feel like there won't be enough change ... until there's no wage gap, and until someone says 'You're my favorite comic,' not 'You're my favorite female comic.'

I call it ""grape,"" because it's this gray area. Not of whether or not it was rape, but it's not the way we think of, like, a Law and Order episode. And when it's not as black and white for everyone, it makes it harder for them to digest. So it's this very personal thing to me, that I decided to share. And I'm only looking for people to feel less alone reading it, and maybe for a guy to read it and think, ""Oh."" Maybe that'll stop somebody in their tracks, I don't know.

On whether the world has changed for female comedians in the past few years

Not enough. Things are being talked about more than they used to be, things like the wage gap. ... I do talk about sex because I do think that a lot of things translate from the bedroom into how you live your everyday life. Like, as a woman, I think that a lot of women are in relationships where they're with someone who doesn't make sure that they orgasm. And the woman doesn't make it important ... and I think that translates to the office, where you should demand to be spoken to and treated equally to men. I feel like there won't be enough change ... until there's no wage gap, and until someone says ""You're my favorite comic,"" not ""You're my favorite female comic."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mikhail Metzel/TASS Mikhail Metzel/TASS

It started with a report and erupted into a controversy involving a mufti, a Russian Orthodox priest and a rabbi.

The subject: female genital mutilation.

On Aug. 15, the Russian Justice Initiative issued a report called ""Production of Genital Mutilation of Girls in the Republic of Dagestan."" Female genital mutilation, or FGM, is the practice of cutting away all or part of the clitoris and sometimes the labia. It's usually done in the belief that it will reduce female sexual desire and therefore, promiscuity. The report said that the mutilations were being performed in remote mountain villages in predominantly Muslim regions of Dagestan on girls as young as 3 and as old as 11.

Although FGM has been condemned by the U.N. and the World Health Organization, the report says it's not banned by Russian law. The report marks the first systematic documentation of FGM in the region. Human rights activists in Russia called for an investigation of the findings.

Then came the controversy.

Asked to comment, Mufti Ismail Berdiev — a Muslim religious leader from the area — told a Moscow radio station, ""Moscow Says,"" that female circumcision is a ""healthy custom"" practiced in one of the republics of Russia's North Caucasus region. Berdiev even said that all women should be circumcised ""to end depravity on Earth and reduce sexuality.""

The Russian news agency, Interfax, promptly contacted the mufti to ask if what he said was an endorsement of FGM. Berdiev expanded on the theme, saying female circumcision is ""necessary to reduce women's sexuality.... God created women to give birth to children and to raise children. And [circumcision] doesn't have anything to do with that. Women can still give birth, and there's less depravity.""

Berdiev is an influential cleric, the chairman of the North Caucasus Muslim Coordinating Center, so his words carry weight.

He soon got qualified support from another religious conservative, Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin, a former spokesman for the Russian Orthodox Church. In a post on Facebook, Chaplin wrote, ""Ay-ay-ay. Now we're seeing some real feminist howling because of what Mufti Ismail Berdiev has said."" The archpriest said he respects female circumcision as a ""time-honored practice recognized by the majority of women living in this [Muslim] tradition. ""We probably don't need to circumcise all women,"" he added. ""There's no need with Orthodox Christian women, for example; they don't fornicate as it is."" As a parting shot, Chaplin said ""Without a doubt, Feminism is the lie of the 20th century.""

A prominent rabbi also weighed in. Boruch Gorin, the head of public relations of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, didn't address the propriety of FGM but didn't condemn it either. He did concur that ""debauchery"" and ""licentiousness"" are serious problems in the community. ""A faithful man is surrounded by a huge number of temptations,"" Gorin said, though he added that female circumcision does not solve the ""problem of corruption.""

Berdiev has since walked his comments back. After the uproar broke, Berdiev told the Meduza news website that he was ""misunderstood"" in his earlier interviews and that he'd been joking about circumcising all women. He said he hadn't read the report and didn't in fact know whether FGM was still being performed in Dagestan.

But he didn't back down on the message that women's sexuality should be controlled. ""For what purpose did the Almighty create woman? To give birth to children, to raise them and not to work outside the home.... According to Shariah [Islamic law], this should be done.""

He acknowledged that circumcision wouldn't improve a woman's ability to care for children. ""But why did I make that joke? Because debauchery is everywhere now. Women must dress appropriately. Christians have this, too.""

In its report, the Russian Justice Initiative called for a ban on FGM in Russia. A Russian lawmaker has now drafted legislation to outlaw the practice."

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Coming up, it's Lightning Fill in the Blank. But first, it's the game where you have to listen for the rhyme. If you'd like to play on air, call or leave a message at 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. You can click the contact us link on our website. That's waitwait.npr.org. There, you can find out about attending our weekly live shows right here at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago and our upcoming shows at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., on September 1; Rochester, N.Y., on October 20; and Nashville, Tenn., November 3.

Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT ...DON'T TELL ME.

LINDSEY DAVIDSON: Hi, this is Lindsey Davidson, and I'm calling from Edmond, Okla.

SAGAL: Edmond, Okla. Now, I do not know where that is. Where is it?

DAVIDSON: So I - it's basically a suburb of Oklahoma City.

SAGAL: Oh, OK. That's fine.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

SAGAL: What do you do there?

DAVIDSON: So I actually work in Stillwater at Oklahoma State University, and I do social media for the division of agricultural sciences and natural resources.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: Now, wait, what do you - so you do social media for a school of agriculture. Is that what you said?

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I get paid to do the fun stuff. I feel like it's not even a real job.

ALONZO BODDEN: Now, what do you snapchat from the school of agriculture? Like, watch this grow.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Welcome to the show, Lindsey. Bill Kurtis is going to read you three news-related limericks with the last word or phrase missing from each. If you can fill in that last word or phrase correctly in two of the limericks, you will be a winner. You ready to play?

DAVIDSON: All right? Let's do this.

SAGAL: Here is your first limerick.

BILL KURTIS: I'm loving my dorm's special fee-tza (ph). I hope this machine will take Vi-tza (ph). Through this slot it will squeeze extra meat, sauce and cheese. A vending machine that bakes...

DAVIDSON: Pizza.

SAGAL: Pizza.

KURTIS: Yeah, there you go.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: Xavier University in Ohio has unveiled the world's first pizza ATM. Just insert your card, type in your PIN and three minutes later, a piping hot pizza comes out of a slot. No longer will pesky human interaction get between you and your freshman 15.

(LAUGHTER)

BODDEN: Only in America.

SAGAL: Absolutely. We're all rats now. We're just going up to machines and pressing buttons to get food pellets.

ADAM FELBER: Delicious, cheesy, hot food pellets.

SAGAL: I want one right now.

FELBER: Yeah.

SAGAL: Here is your next limerick.

KURTIS: We fishes aren't scared of the dark. Past fierce rows of teeth we embark. Our lunch pails distract those jaws from attacks. Meals ready to eat for a...

DAVIDSON: I don't know.

SAGAL: Rows of teeth.

BODDEN: Popular in a very good movie.

DAVIDSON: Shark. Oh, my God.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, there you go. That-a (ph) girl.

SAGAL: There you go.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: A shark, yes.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: We tend to think of sharks as ruthless hunters intent on stalking their prey. But a new study published in a journal says sharks are just like us. They do not like working for their food. They pick the easiest option, whether that's a dead sea turtle floating there or the swim-through lane at Kentucky Fried Surfer or the new chum ATM at Xavier University in Ohio.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Yeah, that's why they - you know, you - they say - I haven't been in this situation - but they say if you just bonk it on the nose, it leaves.

FELBER: Yeah.

BODDEN: They don't tell you if you bonk him in the nose, he leaves, comes back with a few friends.

SAGAL: Yeah.

POUNDSTONE: No, they don't like friction.

FELBER: How do you know this?

POUNDSTONE: I've read it in the book.

FELBER: You mean, like, sharks don't like friction...

POUNDSTONE: I mean, I didn't do my own study, but I did...

FELBER: ...That they're conflict-avoidant.

POUNDSTONE: Yes, they are.

SAGAL: Yeah, you mean, like, emotional friction? Like, look, I'm going to eat you. I hope that's OK. I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

POUNDSTONE: Yeah, they just don't like any kind of conflict.

BODDEN: Keep in mind, when they do these studies, they never get to talk to someone who was actually eaten by a shark.

SAGAL: Yeah.

BODDEN: It's never, hey, what did you do wrong?

FELBER: It could be that just about everybody ever eaten by a shark first bonked it on the nose.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: His last words were Paula was wrong.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Lindsey, we still have one more limerick for you. Here it is.

KURTIS: An airship or just airborne smut? It's two blimps tied together, that's what. In the middle, a crack. It seems to lack tact. It looks like a huge flying...

DAVIDSON: Fact?

SAGAL: I think, Lindsey, you might be too nice and too polite to get this. But I do want to give you one more chance.

DAVIDSON: Oh, butt?

SAGAL: Yes.

POUNDSTONE: Yeah.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

KURTIS: There you go.

FELBER: How dare you? How dare you?

POUNDSTONE: Of course not, Lindsey, this is public radio.

SAGAL: Finally, after years of development, the Airlander 10, the world's longest aircraft, was unveiled this week in Britain. It's a dirigible with these two long cylinders fused together to form what aeronautics experts call a big butt in the sky. British media immediately branded it the flying bum. When it flies overhead, it looks like God is about to sit on you. Worse, it's essentially a high-tech blimp, so it's filled with gas.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Lindsey do on our quiz?

KURTIS: She's such a good sport. Let's give her all.

SAGAL: Congratulations, Lindsey.

DAVIDSON: Thank you so much.

SAGAL: You did that well.

DAVIDSON: Thank you. I appreciate it.

SAGAL: Thanks for playing.

DAVIDSON: Thank you, guys.

Here’s what everyone needs to know: When on assignment, do not turn to friends, family members, freelance producers or foreign fixers and ask them to take a picture to go with the digital version of your story.

This has been happening in recent months and as the Visuals team notes, it’s a problem. Among the issues:

– In most cases, the people being asked to take photographs are not trained journalists, so NPR may not be able to vouch for the journalistic integrity of their image-making.

– In some cases, the person who’s been asked to take a photo is being employed by NPR to do a very specific job. Because the photo-making is not negotiated ahead of time, it’s asking someone to do more work than they’ve signed on to do.

– Why not just pay them another $50? Well, the budget for photos is limited, so Visuals must carefully weigh whether to hire a photographer to cover any particular story. If the budget gets drained by ad hoc arrangements, we may not be able to hire professionals for other stories.

– What’s wrong with having your son or daughter come along to take photos? Asking minors to work for us raises child labor issues, liability issues and ethical issues.

We understand that it can be hard to collect tape and make images and do everything else that goes into being a multi-platform journalist. Here’s what the Visuals team asks:

“If reporters think they won’t be able to handle gathering images in the field on their own, they and their editors should come to us and we’ll figure out a solution. If a story warrants original imagery, that decision and hire should be made by a photo editor on the Visuals team.”

Meanwhile, everyone should be on notice that photos taken by “my friend Buzz” or “my nephew who’s really good with a camera” will be turned down for one or more of the reasons above.

Bottom line: It’s important to remember that all assets for stories gathered in the field should be collected by NPR journalists, or NPR-commissioned journalists. The images that go with our reports are important. Think about it this way: Would you hand a microphone to that precocious niece of yours and have her do some interviews?

Breath of Earth by Beth Cato Paperback, pages ; cm | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

More than a century later, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake remains a dramatic, traumatic moment in American history. That makes it the perfect vector for an alternate history novel — a potential that isn't lost on Beth Cato. In her latest novel, Breath of Earth, the Nebula-nominated author casts off from the wholly fabricated fantasy world of her acclaimed steampunk duology, The Clockwork Dagger and The Clockwork Crown. Instead, she sets Breath of Earth at the center — indeed, the epicenter — of a magic-infused, reality-warped version of San Francisco circa 1906. In so many ways, it's a city on the brink. And Cato doesn't let you forget that for a second.

Breath of Earth opens on April 15, 1906, three days before the quake took place in our world. Cato's world, though, is strikingly not ours. Following Japan's intervention in the U.S. Civil War, which included military aid in the form of magic, the two countries formed an alliance called the Unified Pacific. Since then, the superpower has consolidated its hold on the globe through its use of geomancy: magic drawn from the energy of the earth itself. By 1906, the Unified Pacific is waging a never-ending war with rival power China, leading to the oppression of Chinese-Americans on the West Coast. Ingrid Carmichael is a 25-year-old secretary to Warden Sakaguchi of the Earth Wardens Cordilleran Auxiliary, a group that uses geomancy for the public good — so long as it aligns with the interests of the Unified Pacific.

When the Auxiliary is mysteriously attacked, the headstrong Ingrid begins owning her considerable geomantic power, which she's had to suppress due to the sexism of the age. And as she struggles through a web of homegrown unrest and geopolitical intrigue, a dashing Southerner named Cy Jennings sparks feelings she's not ready to deal with. Cato already proved her expertise as weaving romance with adventure in her Clockwork books, and in Breath of Earth, she keeps that chemistry breezy; in fact, the book as a whole strikes a nervy balance between easygoing charm and suspense, especially as the four-day-long plot counts down to the fateful quake that threatens to destroy much more than a chunk of San Francisco.

Cato's exhaustive research of the time and place gives the book texture and grit, and she hasn't whitewashed what was a very problematic chapter of America's history.

As brisk as Cato's plot is, it's also straightforwardly simple. But she embroiders it richly with gorgeous period setpieces, imaginative speculation and the charismatic Ingrid herself, a hero-coming-into-her-own full of gumption and dimension. Cato's system of earth-based magic is fun to dig into, so to speak, and she injects plenty of swashbuckling action into her conceptual playground. There's even some good-old-fashioned, goggles-and-airships steampunk barnstorming to sink your teeth into, another welcome holdover from the Clockwork books.

Where Breath of Earth really shines, though, is in its detail and relevance. Cato's exhaustive research of the time and place gives the book texture and grit, and she hasn't whitewashed what was a very problematic chapter of America's history. She spotlights the plight of the Chinese-American population of the West Coast in the early 20th century with sensitivity and attention; at the same time, that tension becomes essential to the story, especially as it boils over into the streets of San Francisco. Historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt weave throughout the story with neat twists. And the book speaks to this century, too. It may take place in an alternate universe over a hundred years ago, but it deals with the issues of xenophobia, racism, sexism and anti-immigrant hatred set against a backdrop of perpetual war, a situation that feels familiar today. Rather than taking a soapbox stand, Breath of Earth makes its points as a witty, charming adventure yarn — one that's only as escapist as you want to be.

NPR's Rachel Martin talks with Lisa Fenn, the author of ""Carry On: A Story of Resilience, Redemption, and an Unlikely Family,"" and the two athletes Fenn profiled, Dartanyon Crockett and Leroy Sutton.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

It was February of 2009, and Lisa Fenn was working as a features producer for ESPN. Her dad knew she was always looking for a good story, so when he saw a write-up in his local Cleveland paper about two high school wrestlers with an unusual bond, he told her she should check it out. She did, and she was awestruck by the friendship she found between these two young men, Leroy Sutton and Dartanyon Crockett, each working to overcome the incredible roadblocks life had thrown in their way.

Leroy lost both his legs in a train accident when he was just 11 years old. Dartanyon is legally blind and, when Lisa met him, essentially homeless. Neither young man let any of that stand in their way when it came to competing on and off the mat. Lisa has written a new book called ""Carry On"" about Leroy and Dartanyon and how her own life has been changed by these two young men.

All three of them join me now from the studios of Colorado Public Radio in Denver. Hey, you guys. Thanks so much for being with us.

LEROY SUTTON: Thank you for having us.

DARTANYON CROCKETT: Thank you for having us.

LISA FENN: Thank you.

MARTIN: So Leroy and Dartanyon, I summarized how Lisa first heard about the two of you, but when did you first hear that there was this ESPN producer cruising around who wanted to do a story on you? And when you met her, what were your first impressions? And I'll start with Leroy.

SUTTON: I had previous experience with a media type, so I wasn't really accepting. But our coach did come up to us, and he stated that we should be open to talking to her. But I was still kind of, like, reluctant to do so.

MARTIN: How come?

SUTTON: With my previous experience with media, it was just kind of they'd come up, do their job and then disappear.

FENN: I think after Leroy's accident, he got a lot of coverage from local and some national media, and a lot of the coverage sort of painted him as this inspirational kid who had stared down the mighty locomotive, been overcome. But in fact, in his personal life and his home life he was, you know, very much languishing in the effects of trauma and of poverty. And it wasn't quite as shiny as people were led to believe by the media coverage. So I think what he's come to understand was that in some ways, as a vulnerable 11-year-old boy, he felt used by that.

MARTIN: Dartanyon, how did you feel about the situation? I mean, did you share that skepticism that Leroy had?

CROCKETT: Yes and no.

SUTTON: No.

CROCKETT: For me, it was like, about time. I've been working hard at this wrestling crap, I'm a good athlete, and about time someone wants to ask me questions about something and put me on some sort of sports network. And so I kind of jumped at the idea of being interviewed by Lisa. I'm like, oh man.

MARTIN: Dartanyon, you were already on the wrestling team at Lincoln West when Leroy came on, right?

CROCKETT: Mm-hmm (ph).

MARTIN: So what was your reaction and that of your teammates when you heard a guy with no legs was going to join?

CROCKETT: I was, like, one of the guys who was quick to wrestle him because everybody else was like, I don't know what to do with that.

SUTTON: I don't know what to do.

CROCKETT: We just worked ankle picks last week and coach, you can't - you're not giving me anything to work with here (laughter).

MARTIN: So this whole interaction, your relationship with Lisa, started because she saw this picture of you, right? The two of you.

CROCKETT: Right.

MARTIN: Dartanyon carrying Leroy.

SUTTON: Me riding my mighty steed.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: You on the back of Dartanyon.

CROCKETT: Black stallion.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: So this was a thing that started happening. Dartanyon, you carried Leroy up and down stairs, inside gyms, on and off buses that your team would take to meets. So it was clear to you, Lisa, probably from the beginning - right? - that these two shared a unique kind of friendship. But when did you realize that this was an altogether different kind of story? Because by this point in your career as a producer for ESPN, this was the thing you did. You did, like, these kind of very emotional, inspirational stories about athletes. So how did you start thinking of this in a different way?

FENN: The day that my father alerted me to that picture - in the photo, there was just something different about it to me. When I finally saw them in person, I was even more moved and touched by - and though they joke around a lot, just the mere act of carrying one another, there's a tenderness involved in that. There's a vulnerability involved in that. That's not sort of the norm in teen urban culture. But, you know, as I spent time in their school - and it's a hardened place. There's - it's - it is. And so to see this expression of compassion and this expression of self-sacrifice, it just stood out to me as really extraordinary.

MARTIN: The film came out in 2009. Lisa, can you describe the response?

FENN: It was overwhelming in the best possible way. Within a few minutes of it airing I started receiving emails from viewers, and they were enamored by Leroy and Dartanyon. They were really touched by their expression of friendship, and they were moved to want to help them. Most of them were offering money to get them to college. They were offering new ramps and wheelchairs and scholarships and really just an overwhelming number of opportunities and ideas to help these two into sustainable futures.

MARTIN: We should say in total, you got pledges for more than $40,000. Is that right?

FENN: Yeah, it was close to $50,000. And then on top of that, there were three really generous families offering to pay their college tuitions themselves.

MARTIN: You talk about this book - the subtitle's ""A Story Of Resilience, Redemption, And An Unlikely Family."" You did start feeling a kind of maternal sense towards these two guys.

FENN: Yeah, I definitely did for Dartanyon, who lost his mother when he was 8 years old, and for Leroy, who has had difficulties with his mother stemming from his trauma. They both had a hole in their lives for a mother figure, and I just feel really blessed that they let me have that kind of relationship with them.

MARTIN: Fast-forward, a lot of things have changed. You got Dartanyon in touch with the Paralympics. And Dartanyon, you have switched your sport. I don't know if you still wrestle, but now you are into judo. You won a bronze at the 2012 Games in London, which is awesome. Congratulations for that.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

MARTIN: And soon you're going to head to Rio to compete in this year's Paralympics, right?

CROCKETT: Yep.

MARTIN: And Leroy, you've graduated from college. You're working as a videogame tester. I guess I would ask both of you - Dartanyon first - how have your expectations for your life changed since you met Lisa?

CROCKETT: It put me in a position to where I - if I don't have a certain resource, I know how to find it. If I don't have certain people in my life who know the answers to the questions that I have, I can find the people who might. And it gave me tools to create my own avenue of wherever I wanted to go in life.

MARTIN: And Leroy?

SUTTON: The way that I've changed is I'm more open to people. When we speak at schools, I'll spend a lot of time talking to some of the kids just to get a sense of what they're going through.

MARTIN: Lisa, when you look back, how have these two young men changed you?

FENN: On a personal level, they are my family. I don't know that they've changed my family, but they've become my family. And I also have a 6-year-old son who's adopted, and he's African-American. And he believes Leroy and Dartanyon - he believes correctly that they are his big brothers. So much so that for his sixth birthday, he asked for a wheelchair for his birthday...

(LAUGHTER)

FENN: ...Because he wants to be like his brother Leroy. And that's beautiful to me, that race, that disability has normalized in my family setting because I think it's a reflection of what we've - what we want for our society.

MARTIN: Lisa Fenn. Her new book is called ""Carry On: A Story Of Resilience, Redemption, And An Unlikely Family."" We were also joined by Leroy Sutton and Dartanyon Crockett. Thanks to all three of you.

SUTTON: Thank you.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

FENN: Thank you, Rachel.

MARTIN: And Dartanyon, good luck in Rio.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

Do you know that feeling when a song moves you so much, you just feel like you have to add your own voice? Mexican culture has an answer to that: a cathartic, joyous yell called a grito.

Legendary Mexican performer Vicente Fernández, aka ""Chente,"" performs the crazy tragic love song ""Volver, Volver."" ""It's one of the most iconic mariachi songs of all time, performed by the most popular Mexican mariachi vocalist ever,"" says alt.latino's Felix Contreras. ""And there is a championship grito at the top of the song.""

YouTube

Growing Up Hearing Gritos

Like lots of Mexican-American kids, Contreras and I grew up hearing the adults in our lives performing gritos when they listened to mariachi music at family barbecues, or cheering on friends and family at graduation.

""In my family, my mother and my grandfather, her step-dad, when we would be at family parties like Christmas or something like that, we'd be in the other room playing, we'd hear a really loud grito, we knew the party was on, it just took it to a different level,"" Contreras says. ""It was the ultimate expression that we were really having a good time.""

I am pretty sure I could identify my tíos and tías by their gritos, and many Mexican-American children begin finding their own grito voice early.

Like many schools in Texas, students at Perez Elementary school in Austin have the opportunity to learn and perform mariachi music. Their teacher, Angela Machado, is too busy teaching them chords and song lyrics to teach them gritos. ""It is not part of the curriculum necessarily but I know a lot of them do already know how,"" she says.

Third graders Leo Garcia, Jose Jaimes, Mario Flores and Angelita Alivter Cardenas show me their gritos. They sound like lion cubs learning how to roar.

If they want to keep working on their gritos, these kids may have a chance in college. Ezekiel Castro is a lecturer at the University of Texas Sarah and Ernest Butler School of Music. He is also director of the school's mariachi ensemble and teaches about mariachi culture. The grito is an important part of that.

""The Mexicans are very emotional people,"" says Castro. ""When they hear mariachi music, whether it's because of sorrow or because of joy, they do these gritos, these yells."" Castro says his students do a much better grito than he does. ""Some people are just exquisite with it. Others, you know, we just do the best we can.""

Gritos aren't just emotional; they're political. One of Mexico's founding fathers uttered the first documented grito in history when he declared the war for Mexican independence. The president of Mexico does a more formal grito every year on that anniversary, as Enrique Peña Nieto did in 2015.

Grito 101

YouTube

Laura Gutierrez teaches Mexican performance studies at the University of Texas. She says gritos are complex expressions. ""They're like small narrative capsules, without the narrative that are full of layers of emotion,"" Gutierrez says. And belting out a great grito feels really good. ""When you finally release the last gasp of air, there's relief,"" Gutierrez says.

Video producer Kathryn Gonzales rediscovered the grito at a 2014 Day of the Dead party in west Texas. ""I was the only brown person at the whole party,"" Gonzales says. ""There was a little conjunto band and I was so moved, I don't even really honestly remember the song, but I was compelled to do a grito.""

But there were two things stopping her. ""I thought well, A, I don't know if anyone here would know what that was and why I was doing it,"" Gonzales says. ""And B, I thought I don't really know if I know how to do a good grito, like I'm not sure that I could pull it off.""

So Gonzales teamed up with a developer friend and created the Grito App.

""You scroll through the different sounds, each sound has its own screen. You can learn a little more about the grito, you can share the grito, you can save it to your videos and just kind of text it or email it around,"" Gonzales says.

Since mariachi music is less popular among newer generations, not that many young people know how to do a good grito. Castro says that's no reason not to try. ""Everybody has their own individual way of doing gritos,"" he says. ""It's a great expression.""

Growing Into Gritos

Felix Contreras tried to do a grito when he was a college student at Cal State University Fresno in the late '70s. His friends would have grito contests after a long night. ""It was pathetic. I thought, 'Ugh, I definitely won't be doing that again.'""

And even though his alt.latino co-host Jasmine Garsd has been trying to get him to do a grito on-air, Contreras says he won't do it. ""You have to not be afraid to be the subject of attention in a small world,"" Contreras says. ""You have to use the front of the diaphragm, full of gusto, and release anguish and joy from your soul to do a successful grito.""

Contreras has found himself listening to more mariachi music over the years. ""It's an acquired taste as you get older, you experience life's heartbreaks and joys, the lyrics and the recitations and the performance resonates in a different way,"" Contreras says. ""It has all the secrets to life in the lyrics. You don't know that when you're in your twenties.""

""By the time you hit your forties, Chente knew what he was talking about,"" Contreras says. And you might feel inspired to try out your own grito."

The old newsroom adage “if your mother says she loves you, check it out,” applies to information on the Internet as well.

We all know this, but occasionally we get reminders of how important it is not to trust everything we see on the Web and to be sure to do our due diligence before passing along any information we get from there.

Case in point: On Wednesday, WAMU’s Diane Rehm said to Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., “senator, you have dual citizenship with Israel.” Sanders quickly corrected her, but Diane went on to say that his name was on a list of lawmakers with such dual citizenship. Sanders told her that was “some of the nonsense that goes on in the Internet.”

Diane later issued a statement saying she had gotten the incorrect information from “a comment on Facebook.”

Diane has apologized. She stated as fact something that wasn’t.

We didn’t learn something from this episode. This is a relearning.

We have an entry about this in the Ethics Handbook entitled “Give preference to original sources.” Here’s what it says:

”For years, NPR journalists have been cautioned by their editors that an all- too-common pitfall of fact checking is verifying ‘facts’ through second sources, such as other news media outlets, that do not have ‘direct’ knowledge about what they supposedly know. The problem has only gotten more serious as the Internet has made it ever easier to find what others have reported as ‘fact.’ That’s why we value primary sources for our facts and we check them before broadcast or publication. And we value the work of the NPR reference librarians in helping our journalists get to those original sources (to email them, look for ‘NPR Library’ in the NPR internal email address book). “We value our own reporting and fact-gathering over that done by other news outlets. We strongly prefer to confirm and verify information ourselves before reporting. When reporting on events we did not witness personally, we seek multiple independent perspectives to get a sharper, more accurate understanding of what happened. And if we can’t verify what others are reporting, but still believe the news is important and needs to be reported, we tell listeners and readers that NPR has not yet independently confirmed the news. Too often, incorrect information is passed down from one news story to another because of the failure of the first outlet to get it right. We strive to never pass on errors in this way.”

In other words, check, double-check and triple-check those so-called facts you find on the Internet. Be very skeptical about the credibility of the sources. Get first-hand information. Go right to the original source.

Confirm with mom just how she feels.

Crusty editors aren’t the only ones who extol the merits of “precision writing and editing.”

Here’s what comedian Hasan Minaj had to say about Jon Stewart during Elizabeth Blair’s piece on Morning Edition today:

“He’s always been really great about cutting. … Because we only have 22 minutes to convey a lot and in a field piece you only have 4 1/2, 5 minutes, maybe 6 minutes tops. … Cutting out extraneous stuff, even if it’s extra laughs. … Cutting those things out to convey the story and to convey the narrative and the argument. And you’ll still get great jokes in there. But once you really establish and lay that groundwork out, that’s where it goes to that next level.”

Followers have come to depend on his flawless falsetto, his skill for draping a song in perfectly-fitted production and that velvet voice's ability to sound so intimate it makes everything else drop away.

Over five albums, the latest of which, blackSUMMERS'night, came out in July, this singular artist has developed his sound with the help of a few crucial collaborations, including one that began with a question:

""What the hell is a Hod?""

That was Maxwell's response, more than 20 years ago, to getting a message from the songwriter and producer Hod David. Since that auspicious beginning, Maxwell and David have forged a creative partnership that is in nearly every note of Maxwell's songs, even if it's invisible to most casual fans. Noteworthy host Jason King visited the pair at David's studio in New York City to find out how the relationship has evolved.

FARAI CHIDEYA, HOST:

The Hugo Awards are handed out each year for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. They've been awarded since 1955 in categories like best novel and best graphic story. Tonight, author Nnedi Okorafor is up for best novella for her story about a girl named Binti.

NNEDI OKORAFOR: (Reading) I powered up the transporter and said a silent prayer. I had no idea what I was going to do if it didn't work. My transporter was cheap, so even a droplet of moisture or more likely a grain of sand would cause it to short. It was faulty, and most of the time I had to restart it over and over before it worked. Please not now, please not now, I thought.

CHIDEYA: Well, that's one way to head off to college, at least for the title character, Binti. She's a teenager headed to the best university among worlds, some of which are at war with each other. Author Nnedi Okorafor joins us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. Welcome.

OKORAFOR: Thank you. Glad to be here.

CHIDEYA: So how did you come up with this character, who has many fascinating talents we'll get into, and this world?

OKORAFOR: It's interesting because a lot of my stories are often based on several things, but their foundation is in the stories of the women and girls around me and also within myself. And Binti comes from a very insular family - a cultural family that's very close. And she ends up picking up and going and leaving her family and going just so that she can go to a university that is on another planet.

And the way that that kind of came along was, for me at the time, I had decided to take a position at the University of Buffalo in New York. They were having a bit of a hard time with it, and it was a decision that I had made. And it was a very, very big decision, and eventually I had to just do it. I had to just go. The first few months I was there, that was when I wrote ""Binti,"" and I was kind of exploring my family's fears and a lot of their fears were logical. And I was exploring them, and I was thinking what if the fears that they had of me leaving and doing this really just kind of breaking from the family in this way - what if their fears came true? And that's where the plot of ""Binti"" came from.

CHIDEYA: And you're the American-born child of Igbo parents from Nigeria, and that ethnic group has tens of millions of people in the most populous country on the continent of Africa. So how has that heritage affected your world view?

OKORAFOR: I call myself Nigamerican (ph) as opposed to Nigerian-American because Nigamerican is one word. That's very much a part of my identity, and it's also very much a reason why I think I ended up writing science fiction and fantasy because I live on these borders - and these borders that allow me to see from multiple perspectives and kind of take things in and then kind of process certain ideas and certain stories in a very unique way. And that has led me to write this strange fiction that I write, which really isn't that strange if you really look at it through a sort of skewed lens.

CHIDEYA: And a lot of your work includes African characters and just a diverse cast of characters. The award for which you're nominated, the Hugo Award, has been rocked by controversy in recent years with a group of writers sometimes calling themselves the Sad Puppies or the Rabid Puppies, voting as a block against what they argue is boring, multicultural message fiction. Why do you think there's so much pushback against multicultural science fiction and speculative fiction?

OKORAFOR: When people see something that is new to them, you know, new or different or that's so new that they don't quite understand it and so therefore can't analyze it from an easy point of view, the result is often fear. And fear often manifests itself as anger and rage and hatred, and I think that's where a lot of this comes from.

I think that inevitably science fiction and fantasy was going to become more diverse, and I think that certain people kind of react negatively to that because they've been used to being in a certain position for so long. And they feel that they're being moved from the center and becoming less significant when really that is not what's happening at all. Things are just becoming bigger and more exciting, and they're included as well. So I think that it's fear of the unknown. I think these are the last throes of that shift. It's - these are growing pains.

CHIDEYA: How does it fit into your overall writer's mission, however you define that for yourself, to have books not only for adults but children that are in the speculative-fiction genre, you know, things like your ""Akata Witch"" series? Tell us a little bit about that story and also how it fits into your view of what science fiction and speculative fiction and fantasy are?

OKORAFOR: OK. I'll start with ""Akata Witch."" ""Akata Witch"" is a story that is about a Nigerian-American girl who goes back to Nigeria and is dealing with all of her cultural issues, and then one day she finds out she's part of this magical society. She meets friends, and there's a community. And then there's a magical world. Basically, her world just really opens up because it becomes more.

As far as my own mission, I wouldn't say that I have a mission. I know that I was writing these stories because, one, I enjoyed writing stories. Two, I had all of these stories to tell. Like, I'd look around at my relatives, and I listened. And I wasn't seeing these stories that I wanted to see being told. It's not so much a mission. It's just that I love stories, and so I write them and so I produce them.

CHIDEYA: Nnedi Okorafor is an award-winning author. Her book ""Binti"" is up for best novella at the Hugo Science Fiction Awards tonight. Thanks so much for joining us, Nnedi.

OKORAFOR: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

As Stanford undergrads get ready for the fall semester, the university's administrators have issued a new mandate: Pack your books and calculators, but leave the fifths and handles at home.

On Monday, just over a month before classes resume, the university announced a set of changes to its alcohol policy.

Hard liquor will now be completely banned from on-campus parties — unless the party is hosted by groups exclusively for graduate students, and in that case, only mixed drinks are allowed. ""Straight shots of hard alcohol are never allowed at any party,"" the school says.

Beer and wine are still allowed.

And in dorms, individual students (provided they're 21 and over) will be allowed to have liquor — but only in bottles smaller than 750 mL.

Violating the policy could prompt ""administrative action"" and could result in people being kicked out of on-campus housing.

In its statement, Stanford called this ""a sensible, creative solution that has roots in research-based solutions."" Administrators say they are aiming not to prohibit alcohol, but to limit high-risk behavior, specifically. They believe limiting bottle sizes will have that effect:

""Most alcohol retailers only sell large-volume containers — 750 mL and above. Only select retailers sell hard alcohol containers smaller in volume than 750 mL. Therefore, the outlet density of establishments that sell hard alcohol around campus will be greatly reduced. Also, the costs associated with purchasing smaller containers of hard alcohol are higher than the cost per volume of larger containers, which may serve as a deterrent.""

Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin tells NPR that her office is not aware of any other college that has instituted a bottle-size limit on hard alcohol.

But Stanford is far from the first school to restrict liquor on campus. Bowdoin, Bates, Colby and Notre Dame have all had bans in place for more than six years.

Dartmouth banned hard liquor entirely at the beginning of 2015, while the University of Virginia established rules limiting hard liquor at large Greek parties to events with a hired bartender.

Both Dartmouth and U.Va. announced their policy changes in the wake of high-profile sexual assault allegations.

Stanford's policy change comes just a few months after former Stanford student Brock Allen Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.

During the case, Turner blamed his behavior on drinking. ""I made a mistake, I drank too much, and my decision hurt someone ... my poor decision making and excessive drinking hurt someone that night,"" he said in a statement. ""I've been shattered by the party culture and risk taking behavior that I briefly experienced in my four months at school.""

In a letter that went viral, the woman Turner assaulted repeatedly pointed out that drinking was not Turner's crime: It was assault.

""You were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing,"" she said, before graphically describing the assault. ""Why am I still explaining this.""

""You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone?"" she said.

On Twitter, two Stanford professors expressed frustration with the announcement of the alcohol policy change, specifically that it was announced in the wake of sexual assaults but addresses drinking instead of consent.

Lapin, the campus spokeswoman, says the concern over high-risk drinking at Stanford goes back ""many months."" She pointed to a letter from the president and provost in March that mentions alcohol poisoning and academic problems, as well as sexual assault, as reasons for the college's concern over alcohol misuse.

Meanwhile, the judge who gained infamy in the Brock Turner case has made headlines again.

Aaron Persky recused himself from a different sex-related case, in which he was due to decide whether to reduce a felony conviction for possession of child pornography to a misdemeanor.

The judge, who was subjected to a recall campaign after the Turner case, cited ""publicity surrounding the case"" that ""resulted in a personal family situation"" in stepping down from the child porn decision, The Mercury News reports."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Karen Matthews/AP Karen Matthews/AP

The National Labor Relations Board ruled 3-1 Tuesday that graduate students working as teaching or research assistants at private universities are employees with the right to collective bargaining.

The decision comes in response to a petition filed by the Graduate Workers of Columbia-GWC and the United Autoworkers Union, which has been seeking to represent grad student assistants at Columbia University.

NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports that ""only a small fraction of graduate students at public universities are currently represented by unions — but the decision governing private university students is expected to lead to unionization efforts that could organize tens of thousands more.""

The NLRB had long held that students who teach or research at a private university were not employees covered under the National Labor Relations Act, Yuki reports. That changed in 2000, when the board decided a case in favor of students, and changed again with another ruling four years later. Now the NLRB has reversed itself yet again.

In Tuesday's decision, the board majority wrote that the 2004 ruling ""deprived an entire category of workers of the protections of the Act, without a convincing justification in either the statutory language or the policies of the Act without a convincing justification.""

In 2004, the NLRB reasoned that graduate assistants cannot be statutory employees because they ""are primarily students and have a primarily educational, not economic, relationship with their university."" The current board disagreed:

""The Board has the statutory authority to treat student assistants as statutory employees, where they perform work, at the direction of the university, for which they are compensated.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Radiology Radiology

A series of medical images published Tuesday offers the most complete picture, so far, of how the Zika virus can damage the brain of a fetus.

""The images show the worst brain infections that doctors will ever see,"" says Dr. Deborah Levine, at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who contributed to the study. ""Zika is such a severe infection [in fetuses]. Most doctors will have never seen brains like this before.""

The images — published in the journal Radiology — are part of a special report put together by neurologists in Boston and doctors in northeastern Brazil who care for babies with Zika infections.

""Our goal is to illustrate for heath care professionals around the world what they could expect to see with a Zika infection during pregnancy,"" Levine says.

Many research studies — and news stories — have focused on microcephaly — a condition in which babies are born with very small heads, Levine says. But that defect is just the tip of iceberg of what Zika does to a fetus' brain. ""We've illustrated some of those other problems in the study,"" she says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Radiology Radiology

For example, one baby in the study was born with a normal-size head. ""But when you look inside the brain,"" Levine says, ""there's very little brain tissue present.""

MRI scans at 36 weeks of pregnancy showed the fetus' brain was filled with fluid, which had puffed up the size of the skull. And the baby was missing parts of the nervous system, including sections of the brain stem, the spinal cord and midbrain, which controls eye movements and processes information from the eyes and ears.

The baby also had a flattened skull and extra skin around the head — which is likely caused by the skull collapsing in on itself after the brain stopped growing early in development, the researchers write.

For the study, Levine and colleagues analyzed medical images of 46 fetuses and babies born to mothers who had Zika during pregnancy, including a set of twin girls. The data set included images from 93 ultrasounds, 23 MRIs and 41 CT scans taken at the Instituto de Pesquisa in Campina Grande State Paraiba in northeastern Brazil. Doctors also performed autopsies on three babies, who died shortly after birth.

In almost all cases, the babies had damage in the cortex, the outer layer of the brain that controls a huge number of high-level functions like problem-solving, emotion and language. The cortex contains many folds and gives our brains its characteristic shape. But in these babies, often times, the cortex was smooth, Levine says.

""These babies will not be able to behave normally after birth,"" Levine says. ""The question is will they be able to see, hear and move normally.""

All the babies had scars in their brains, called calcifications. These are a telltale sign of an infection, Levine says, and show where the virus has injured the brain — or stopped its development.

The babies also had damage in the brain stem, which controls involuntary actions, like breathing and heartbeat, as well as injuries in the cerebellum, which coordinates muscle activity and voluntary movements.

""These images show what happens in the most severe cases of Zika,"" Levine says. ""What we don't know right now is what [milder] cases look like.""

In other words, could babies who look normal after birth actually have long-lasting neurological problems because of Zika? ""It's too soon to answer that,"" she says."

Scott Simon weighed in last month about the word “pivot,” which he’s tired of hearing in stories about politicians. “The hundredth time you’ve heard it bounce off the echo chamber of pundits and analysts, it begins to smack of smug insider-ness,” he said.

“Pivot” is a word we use a lot when discussing politicians and their shifting positions. It shows up in about 100 stories we posted or broadcast in the past year.

Scott has a point. We don’t have to use the same word every time. Just as each tornado does not have to “sound like a freight train,” every politician’s pirouette does not have to be called a pivot. Let’s try to use some other words. “Change” or “switch” or “shift” offer possibilities. Maybe it’s a simple “turn.”

Today’s other potentially pedantic points:

– Just say “regardless.” “Irregardless” means “without without regard” and just doesn’t make sense.

– If you’re “flaunting,” that means you’re proudly showing off. If you’re “flouting,” you’re showing scorn or contempt; rejecting or defying.

– In almost all cases, you really mean to say “couldn’t care less,” not “could care less.”

– “Sink, sank, sunk.” “Spring, sprang, sprung.” Watch your tenses.

– Redundancies and clichés are almost always wastes of time and space. In the vast majority of cases we’re better off without them.

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels — Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire — set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board — which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space — people with such different histories and experiences — all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored — how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world — that all cultures converge here — that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can — with little or no money — which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys — they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life' — and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about — how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation — whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation."

Ghost Talkers by Mary Robinette Kowal Hardcover, 304 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Look, I am solidly a ray-guns-and-spaceships kind of genre nerd. Never been much for fantasy done after the 1970s (it mostly sounds like bad Tolkien). Never cared much for ghost stories or alternate histories or love stories or horror.

Which is why, on the surface, it might seem odd that I was so thoroughly taken in by Mary Robinette Kowal's newest novel, Ghost Talkers. I mean, it's essentially an alternate history love story with ghosts in it. Lots and lots of ghosts. And therefore falls firmly into that sprawling pile of Stuff I Wouldn't Read On A Bet.

Except check this out: The hook for it? It's World War I and the British have a whole division called the Spirit Corps who contribute to the war effort by talking to the ghosts of (very) recently dead soldiers in order to gain intelligence about the goings-on at the front. Where did the bullet come from that killed you? At what angle did it enter? Did you hear the crack of the shot? See the German who shot you?

The mediums take reports from every soldier killed. It's a grind of a job and Kowal makes you feel it — makes it almost forensic, almost scientific, in its application. The information taken down by the mediums is all intelligence, and it is used to direct fire, to plan attacks, to shift defenses. It figures into strategy on both sides, and there's nothing hand-wavey about it. Very little that seems mushy and spiritualist. This is a hard job done by those few volunteers who have a sensitivity for the work, and it is vital.

It was the idea of it that got me into the book, and Kowal's affectless presentation of the mediums and their work that kept me going. Did it help that the main plot concerns American heiress Ginger Stuyvesant (a working medium, exhausted and burnt-out by the stresses of experiencing the deaths of hundreds of young men) and her fiancé, British intelligence agent Benjamin Hartford? Of course it did. I like a good spy story as much as anyone (even without spaceships). And once things get going, Ghost Talkers has a good thrust with the Germans trying to discover the location of the Spirit Corps, a highly-placed mole in the British command, secret murderers, double crosses, codes and ciphers.

... it was that rare ability of Kowal's to make what could have been a completely goofy add-on to the British war effort into something that felt completely wedded and solid that sold me — that spark of a great idea, well-executed.

But it was that rare ability of Kowal's to make what could have been a completely goofy add-on to the British war effort into something that felt completely wedded and solid that sold me — that spark of a great idea, well-executed. It is a story that just works. That lays out a presumption (ghosts are real), builds a plot architecture around it (they might be useful intelligence assets), and then grounds it with emotional weight (those forced to talk to the ghosts of the young and dead might not come out of it unscathed).

The book has flaws, of course. For every deeply considered character like Ginger or her fiancé, there are two who are adorable stereotypes (the excellent Lady Penfold, for example — a professional gossip, titular head of the Corps and, essentially, Downton Abbey's Dowager Countess with a sense of humor and a pistol), and one who is just plain cardboard, like the harrumphing, mustache-twirling, tea-and-crumpets marionette of a general who seems to exist solely to tell Ginger she's being hysterical at every opportunity. And because of some baked-in deus ex machina, there is rarely a moment where it feels as though Ginger is in any real danger (with one notable exception late in the novel).

But still, the plot moves. The ghosts stack up. With the aid of her fiancé and his stuttering personal aide, Ginger travels from the relative safety of Le Havre to the trenches of the front, to POW camps and beyond. There's an undeniable momentum to Kowal's writing, and even in the rough spots, she keeps it going with Ginger's pluck, some spy-vs-spy cleverness and a couple of surprising betrayals.

Still, it's unfortunate, these weaknesses at the center of things. Because Kowal does such a stellar job with making the ridiculous seem grounded. She has the mechanics of ghosts down pat. The history of spiritualism. The shadowy life of ghostly spies.

It's only the real people that occasionally trip her up.

NPR's Rachel Martin talks with Lisa Fenn, the author of ""Carry On: A Story of Resilience, Redemption, and an Unlikely Family,"" and the two athletes Fenn profiled, Dartanyon Crockett and Leroy Sutton.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

It was February of 2009, and Lisa Fenn was working as a features producer for ESPN. Her dad knew she was always looking for a good story, so when he saw a write-up in his local Cleveland paper about two high school wrestlers with an unusual bond, he told her she should check it out. She did, and she was awestruck by the friendship she found between these two young men, Leroy Sutton and Dartanyon Crockett, each working to overcome the incredible roadblocks life had thrown in their way.

Leroy lost both his legs in a train accident when he was just 11 years old. Dartanyon is legally blind and, when Lisa met him, essentially homeless. Neither young man let any of that stand in their way when it came to competing on and off the mat. Lisa has written a new book called ""Carry On"" about Leroy and Dartanyon and how her own life has been changed by these two young men.

All three of them join me now from the studios of Colorado Public Radio in Denver. Hey, you guys. Thanks so much for being with us.

LEROY SUTTON: Thank you for having us.

DARTANYON CROCKETT: Thank you for having us.

LISA FENN: Thank you.

MARTIN: So Leroy and Dartanyon, I summarized how Lisa first heard about the two of you, but when did you first hear that there was this ESPN producer cruising around who wanted to do a story on you? And when you met her, what were your first impressions? And I'll start with Leroy.

SUTTON: I had previous experience with a media type, so I wasn't really accepting. But our coach did come up to us, and he stated that we should be open to talking to her. But I was still kind of, like, reluctant to do so.

MARTIN: How come?

SUTTON: With my previous experience with media, it was just kind of they'd come up, do their job and then disappear.

FENN: I think after Leroy's accident, he got a lot of coverage from local and some national media, and a lot of the coverage sort of painted him as this inspirational kid who had stared down the mighty locomotive, been overcome. But in fact, in his personal life and his home life he was, you know, very much languishing in the effects of trauma and of poverty. And it wasn't quite as shiny as people were led to believe by the media coverage. So I think what he's come to understand was that in some ways, as a vulnerable 11-year-old boy, he felt used by that.

MARTIN: Dartanyon, how did you feel about the situation? I mean, did you share that skepticism that Leroy had?

CROCKETT: Yes and no.

SUTTON: No.

CROCKETT: For me, it was like, about time. I've been working hard at this wrestling crap, I'm a good athlete, and about time someone wants to ask me questions about something and put me on some sort of sports network. And so I kind of jumped at the idea of being interviewed by Lisa. I'm like, oh man.

MARTIN: Dartanyon, you were already on the wrestling team at Lincoln West when Leroy came on, right?

CROCKETT: Mm-hmm (ph).

MARTIN: So what was your reaction and that of your teammates when you heard a guy with no legs was going to join?

CROCKETT: I was, like, one of the guys who was quick to wrestle him because everybody else was like, I don't know what to do with that.

SUTTON: I don't know what to do.

CROCKETT: We just worked ankle picks last week and coach, you can't - you're not giving me anything to work with here (laughter).

MARTIN: So this whole interaction, your relationship with Lisa, started because she saw this picture of you, right? The two of you.

CROCKETT: Right.

MARTIN: Dartanyon carrying Leroy.

SUTTON: Me riding my mighty steed.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: You on the back of Dartanyon.

CROCKETT: Black stallion.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: So this was a thing that started happening. Dartanyon, you carried Leroy up and down stairs, inside gyms, on and off buses that your team would take to meets. So it was clear to you, Lisa, probably from the beginning - right? - that these two shared a unique kind of friendship. But when did you realize that this was an altogether different kind of story? Because by this point in your career as a producer for ESPN, this was the thing you did. You did, like, these kind of very emotional, inspirational stories about athletes. So how did you start thinking of this in a different way?

FENN: The day that my father alerted me to that picture - in the photo, there was just something different about it to me. When I finally saw them in person, I was even more moved and touched by - and though they joke around a lot, just the mere act of carrying one another, there's a tenderness involved in that. There's a vulnerability involved in that. That's not sort of the norm in teen urban culture. But, you know, as I spent time in their school - and it's a hardened place. There's - it's - it is. And so to see this expression of compassion and this expression of self-sacrifice, it just stood out to me as really extraordinary.

MARTIN: The film came out in 2009. Lisa, can you describe the response?

FENN: It was overwhelming in the best possible way. Within a few minutes of it airing I started receiving emails from viewers, and they were enamored by Leroy and Dartanyon. They were really touched by their expression of friendship, and they were moved to want to help them. Most of them were offering money to get them to college. They were offering new ramps and wheelchairs and scholarships and really just an overwhelming number of opportunities and ideas to help these two into sustainable futures.

MARTIN: We should say in total, you got pledges for more than $40,000. Is that right?

FENN: Yeah, it was close to $50,000. And then on top of that, there were three really generous families offering to pay their college tuitions themselves.

MARTIN: You talk about this book - the subtitle's ""A Story Of Resilience, Redemption, And An Unlikely Family."" You did start feeling a kind of maternal sense towards these two guys.

FENN: Yeah, I definitely did for Dartanyon, who lost his mother when he was 8 years old, and for Leroy, who has had difficulties with his mother stemming from his trauma. They both had a hole in their lives for a mother figure, and I just feel really blessed that they let me have that kind of relationship with them.

MARTIN: Fast-forward, a lot of things have changed. You got Dartanyon in touch with the Paralympics. And Dartanyon, you have switched your sport. I don't know if you still wrestle, but now you are into judo. You won a bronze at the 2012 Games in London, which is awesome. Congratulations for that.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

MARTIN: And soon you're going to head to Rio to compete in this year's Paralympics, right?

CROCKETT: Yep.

MARTIN: And Leroy, you've graduated from college. You're working as a videogame tester. I guess I would ask both of you - Dartanyon first - how have your expectations for your life changed since you met Lisa?

CROCKETT: It put me in a position to where I - if I don't have a certain resource, I know how to find it. If I don't have certain people in my life who know the answers to the questions that I have, I can find the people who might. And it gave me tools to create my own avenue of wherever I wanted to go in life.

MARTIN: And Leroy?

SUTTON: The way that I've changed is I'm more open to people. When we speak at schools, I'll spend a lot of time talking to some of the kids just to get a sense of what they're going through.

MARTIN: Lisa, when you look back, how have these two young men changed you?

FENN: On a personal level, they are my family. I don't know that they've changed my family, but they've become my family. And I also have a 6-year-old son who's adopted, and he's African-American. And he believes Leroy and Dartanyon - he believes correctly that they are his big brothers. So much so that for his sixth birthday, he asked for a wheelchair for his birthday...

(LAUGHTER)

FENN: ...Because he wants to be like his brother Leroy. And that's beautiful to me, that race, that disability has normalized in my family setting because I think it's a reflection of what we've - what we want for our society.

MARTIN: Lisa Fenn. Her new book is called ""Carry On: A Story Of Resilience, Redemption, And An Unlikely Family."" We were also joined by Leroy Sutton and Dartanyon Crockett. Thanks to all three of you.

SUTTON: Thank you.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

FENN: Thank you, Rachel.

MARTIN: And Dartanyon, good luck in Rio.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

The Clinton Foundation is working now to ""spin off"" or ""find partners"" for many of its programs, including all international activities and programs funded by foreign and corporate donors, the head of the Clinton Foundation told NPR's Peter Overby. The ""unraveling,"" which would be an attempt to prevent conflicts, would go into effect if Hillary Clinton is elected president.

It will take time to make the changes to each of the foundation's affected programs, said Clinton Foundation President Donna Shalala. ""This kind of unraveling has to be done with a scalpel so that we just do not hurt people, and do not interrupt the very good work that's being done,"" she said.

Many of the foundation's programs would become separate non-governmental organizations ""without us participating in the governance obviously,"" Shalala said. Partner organizations, she said, would also ""continue the work that was started by the Clinton Foundation.""

Founded by President Bill Clinton, the foundation has become a major player in international health and global philanthropy. In 2014, the Clinton Foundation reported $439 million in assets and $338 million in revenue, with $217 million spent on programs.

But it has also been heavily criticized for potential conflicts with the State Department under Hillary Clinton's leadership. Released emails have shown some efforts to connect donors or associates at the foundation to personnel at the State Department.

And on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported that as secretary of state, Clinton met or had phone conversations with 154 private citizens — more than half were donors or connected to entities that gave money to the foundation or its projects.

In response, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence called for the foundation to be ""immediately shut down"" and for an ""independent special prosecutor [to] be appointed to determine if access to Hillary Clinton was for sale."" Donald Trump has also called for the foundation to be shut down.

The foundation announced last week that if Hillary Clinton were to be elected, Bill Clinton would step down from the foundation board and it would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate sources. Shalala said Chelsea Clinton would remain on the board.

Shalala insisted the changes are not a reactionary move. ""We're not responding to the outside criticism,"" she said. ""I was brought in a year ago to help start thinking through what the form would take if she was elected, and the president wanted to do it very carefully.""

It would have been ""presumptuous"" to make such changes before Clinton was the nominee, Shalala said.

The Clintons could have avoided conflicts by letting an independent board of directors oversee decisions, said Leslie Lenkowsky of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. But, he said, he hasn't seen any clear evidence that foundation donors got more than small favors from Hillary Clinton's State Department. ""Unless it really gets to affecting public business, you know, it's not nice to look at and the donors shouldn't do it,"" he said. ""But you know, it happens all the time.""

""The most important thing to the president and to Chelsea is that the work continues but under different umbrellas away from the foundation, obviously, because we will not be able to accept corporate donations or international money as we have to support our programs,"" Shalala continued.

Bill Clinton ""will not be involved"" in the initiatives that are spinning off or merging with another foundation, Shalala said. He also would not do any fundraising for the foundation.

So what would remain of the foundation? ""We have some things that are funded by American foundations,"" Shalala said. She also pointed to the presidential library and Clinton center in Little Rock, Ark. ""There are elements of the Clinton Foundation that people often don't think about that stay forever.""

If Clinton wins the election, Bill Clinton will not have any official connection to the foundation, Shalala said, but ""I'm sure he's going to go visit his library."""

Breath of Earth by Beth Cato Paperback, pages ; cm | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

More than a century later, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake remains a dramatic, traumatic moment in American history. That makes it the perfect vector for an alternate history novel — a potential that isn't lost on Beth Cato. In her latest novel, Breath of Earth, the Nebula-nominated author casts off from the wholly fabricated fantasy world of her acclaimed steampunk duology, The Clockwork Dagger and The Clockwork Crown. Instead, she sets Breath of Earth at the center — indeed, the epicenter — of a magic-infused, reality-warped version of San Francisco circa 1906. In so many ways, it's a city on the brink. And Cato doesn't let you forget that for a second.

Breath of Earth opens on April 15, 1906, three days before the quake took place in our world. Cato's world, though, is strikingly not ours. Following Japan's intervention in the U.S. Civil War, which included military aid in the form of magic, the two countries formed an alliance called the Unified Pacific. Since then, the superpower has consolidated its hold on the globe through its use of geomancy: magic drawn from the energy of the earth itself. By 1906, the Unified Pacific is waging a never-ending war with rival power China, leading to the oppression of Chinese-Americans on the West Coast. Ingrid Carmichael is a 25-year-old secretary to Warden Sakaguchi of the Earth Wardens Cordilleran Auxiliary, a group that uses geomancy for the public good — so long as it aligns with the interests of the Unified Pacific.

When the Auxiliary is mysteriously attacked, the headstrong Ingrid begins owning her considerable geomantic power, which she's had to suppress due to the sexism of the age. And as she struggles through a web of homegrown unrest and geopolitical intrigue, a dashing Southerner named Cy Jennings sparks feelings she's not ready to deal with. Cato already proved her expertise as weaving romance with adventure in her Clockwork books, and in Breath of Earth, she keeps that chemistry breezy; in fact, the book as a whole strikes a nervy balance between easygoing charm and suspense, especially as the four-day-long plot counts down to the fateful quake that threatens to destroy much more than a chunk of San Francisco.

Cato's exhaustive research of the time and place gives the book texture and grit, and she hasn't whitewashed what was a very problematic chapter of America's history.

As brisk as Cato's plot is, it's also straightforwardly simple. But she embroiders it richly with gorgeous period setpieces, imaginative speculation and the charismatic Ingrid herself, a hero-coming-into-her-own full of gumption and dimension. Cato's system of earth-based magic is fun to dig into, so to speak, and she injects plenty of swashbuckling action into her conceptual playground. There's even some good-old-fashioned, goggles-and-airships steampunk barnstorming to sink your teeth into, another welcome holdover from the Clockwork books.

Where Breath of Earth really shines, though, is in its detail and relevance. Cato's exhaustive research of the time and place gives the book texture and grit, and she hasn't whitewashed what was a very problematic chapter of America's history. She spotlights the plight of the Chinese-American population of the West Coast in the early 20th century with sensitivity and attention; at the same time, that tension becomes essential to the story, especially as it boils over into the streets of San Francisco. Historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt weave throughout the story with neat twists. And the book speaks to this century, too. It may take place in an alternate universe over a hundred years ago, but it deals with the issues of xenophobia, racism, sexism and anti-immigrant hatred set against a backdrop of perpetual war, a situation that feels familiar today. Rather than taking a soapbox stand, Breath of Earth makes its points as a witty, charming adventure yarn — one that's only as escapist as you want to be.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Nextdoor/Screenshot by NPR Nextdoor/Screenshot by NPR

Think before you post.

That's not the message you typically get from Internet companies. The ethos on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram is to (over) share. But Nextdoor, a social network, has decided to block users from publishing certain posts, specifically when they appear to be racial profiling.

A techie tackles race

Talking about race and racial profiling does not come naturally to Nirav Tolia, the CEO of Nextdoor. And yet, he's doing it anyway.

""What someone considers to be racist is something that is, unfortunately in many cases, in the eye of the beholder,"" he says. ""Why do some people like Trump and some people think that he's Satan?""

Tolia is a tech entrepreneur, not a politician. Nextdoor is a popular social network for neighborhoods. You use your real name and address to join an online group with your real neighbors.

The company is confronting a tough problem: How do you stop an activity when people can't even agree on how to define it? Jaywalking and speeding are easy. Racial profiling does not have a universally accepted definition, as criminology experts note.

In the face of public criticism by users who felt the site was permitting racism and fear mongering, Nextdoor decided to create a working definition that is relatively broad: anything that allows a person to stereotype an entire race. And throughout this summer, in a move that's highly unusual for a tech company, Tolia and his engineers have been testing ways to put a stop to it online.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

People engage in racial profiling ""often not on purpose,"" Tolia says. It's implicit bias. For example, he says, a user might think: ""If I look out my window, and I see someone breaking into a car, and the only thing I see is that they're dark-skinned, why can't I post [it]? That's all I see.""

The problem with that post — ""a dark-skinned man is breaking into a car"" — is that, while the activity sounds like a crime, the description of the alleged perpetrator lacks any useful detail, like what he was wearing, his sneakers, his hairstyle or height.

""Because that message goes out to the entire neighborhood, where presumably many of the neighbors reading the post are dark-skinned, that would be considered racial profiling,"" Tolia explains.

Nextdoor was no stranger to such posts. The end effect, he says, was more hurtful than helpful, generating animosity among neighbors, rather than useful tips for law enforcement.

How it works

In a pilot project running in select neighborhoods across the U.S., the company has altered the rules for posting. When a user goes to post about a crime or suspicious activity, in the Crime & Safety section, a new form requires two physical descriptors — e.g. Nike sneakers, blue jeans, crew cut, brunette — if the user chooses to include the race of the person.

An algorithm under development spot checks the summary of the suspicious activity for racially charged terms, as well as for length. If the description is too short, it is presumed to lack meaningful detail and is unacceptable.

If a draft post violates the algorithm's rules or the form's mandatory fields, the user has to revise. Otherwise, it's not possible to post.

""This is a very, very, very difficult problem in society,"" Tolia says. ""Do I believe that a series of forms can stop people from being racist? Of course I don't. That would be a ridiculous statement.""

Fear of friction

The move to block posts sparked heated internal debate, Tolia admits. ""It's highly unusual for a social network to say: If you don't do this, you cannot post. Highly unusual. I mean, think about Twitter or Facebook or Snapchat. There's no friction at all in the process of posting.""

In tech, ""friction"" is a dirty word. Engineers rack their brains over how to shave seconds off the time it takes to broadcast you to the world.

Some Nextdoor engineers argued that the company should just politely suggest, not require, a better description. They pointed out that when people complain — about bullying, hate speech, revenge porn — on other social networks, those companies don't change their product.

""They may write a blog post, they may make a donation to charity, something like that,"" Tolia says.

Thus far, the company says there's been roughly a 50 percent reduction in racial profiling posts. Tolia's goal, he says, is to drive the number of instances down to zero.

Backstory: A local campaign

There's an interesting backstory here. Ultimately, it was a sustained grass-roots campaign in Oakland, Calif., that compelled the tech company to act.

A group called Neighbors for Racial Justice met with Nextdoor and handed over a blueprint for how to change the platform. Then, they got city officials to weigh in aggressively. For example, at a hearing last December, City Council member Desley Brooks said that if the company doesn't take steps to stop racial profiling, ""we as a city ought to say that we will not allow our employees to continue to post on Nextdoor and validate this poor behavior.""

Nextdoor recruits police and city agencies into the network. They're an added feature, a kind of Community Policing 2.0 that many users want. In the wake of the Dallas shootings, the police department there turned to Nextdoor to communicate safety updates to residents, and later to recruit for the police force. The network says it's partnering with more than 1,600 public agencies in the U.S.

Oakland Council member Annie Campbell Washington says at first Nextdoor employees involved in the discussion weren't willing to fundamentally alter the product. That changed when the CEO stepped in.

She says it's a rare win in Silicon Valley, to get a company to ask users sitting behind their screens ""to think about the person on the other side of the screen who's of a different race, a different ethnicity, and think about how that post may affect their lives.""

Some residents worried the grass-roots campaign was just the PC police. Campbell Washington recalls people writing in with questions: ""Why would you engage in anything that limits people's expression? And especially people who are trying to keep their neighborhoods safe.""

Then, the regular police weighed in. Oakland Lt. Chris Bolton says he would ""much rather"" have a detailed description about a factor that is ""very unique"" — the man who robbed me was wearing tennis shoes with red laces — than a vague description of just the sex and race of a person. He says the changes make Nextdoor more, not less, helpful for real police work.

Nextdoor plans to roll out changes to its entire U.S. network in the coming weeks."

Enlarge this image Gustav Dejert/Getty Images Gustav Dejert/Getty Images

The grass is greener ... if you're a student in Detroit, looking across your school district's boundary with the neighboring Grosse Pointe public schools.

Nearly half of Detroit's students live in poverty; that means a family of four lives on roughly $24,000 a year — or less.

In Grosse Pointe, a narrow stretch of real estate nestled between Detroit and Lake St. Clair, just 7 percent of students live at or below the poverty line.

To recap, that's 49 percent vs. 7 percent. Neighbors.

Which is why a new report from the nonprofit EdBuild ranks the Detroit-Grosse Pointe boundary as ""the most segregating school district border in the country.""

The report, called ""Fault Lines,"" doesn't stop there.

""What we did is built an algorithm that identified all 33,500 school district borders in the country ... and compared their school-aged child poverty rates,"" says Rebecca Sibilia, the founder and CEO of EdBuild.

From this comparison Sibilia's team compiled a list of the 50 most segregating school boundaries in the nation — in short, the district borders with the largest difference in child poverty rates from one side to the other. In this case, ""segregating"" is being used to talk specifically about class, not race, though the two often overlap, especially in America's large urban school systems.

Rounding out the top three on the Fault Lines list are the Birmingham City School District in Alabama and ... the Birmingham City School District in Alabama.

In fact, of Birmingham's 13 school district boundaries, six landed on EdBuild's list of the 50 most segregating. That's because the poverty rate of Birmingham's students is 49 percent, while the district is surrounded by several far smaller, far more affluent districts: Vestavia Hills (6 percent child poverty), Mountain Brook (7 percent), Trussville (10 percent), to name a few.

Birmingham's district lines weren't always a story of haves and have nots, at least not this glaring. Most of the affluent districts now bordering the city's schools were once part of the larger Jefferson County School District. But over the years, they have seceded, using their considerable property tax wealth to create new minidistricts.

Interestingly, Birmingham stands out not only because of its multiple appearances but because Alabama is the only Southern state on the list (unless you count Kentucky or Missouri). One reason for this, says Sibilia, is that in much of the South, county borders do double duty as school district borders, ""and so there is less opportunity for intentional segregation.""

In fact, Sibilia says, she and her team ""were shocked. We honestly believed we were going to see a lot of this in the South and very little in the North.""

Instead, the vast majority of states on EdBuild's list were Northern, with segregating school lines heavily concentrated in the Rust Belt, particularly Ohio. Dayton's schools have two borders on the list. Ditto Youngstown. Cleveland has four. As manufacturing jobs disappeared, so too did families that could afford to move, creating intense pockets of student poverty.

What can be done about it?

There are no easy fixes, owing in part to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1970, the NAACP sued the state of Michigan; its lawyers argued that Detroit's schools were still unofficially segregated more than 15 years after Brown v. Board of Education because of discriminatory housing policies meant to keep African-Americans out of the suburbs. The proposed remedy: a forced desegregation plan involving dozens of surrounding school districts.

But in one of its most controversial decisions, Milliken v. Bradley in 1974, the court ruled that these largely white, affluent suburban districts could not be forced to desegregate because their boundaries were not deliberately discriminatory. Or had not been proved so.

""The court said that the school district as a concept is basically untouchable,"" says Ben Justice, an education historian at Rutgers University's Graduate School of Education.

Justice calls the Milliken decision ""ridiculous"" because, he says, ""to argue that where people live, particularly by the 1960s, was not the result of racist government policy was simply a lie. Public policy and private industry conspired to create neighborhoods where people could or could not live."" And, Justice says, school district lines were (and remain) an extension of that discrimination.

Fast-forward more than 40 years after that ruling. One of the school borders at the heart of that case tops EdBuild's new list: the jagged curve that today separates Detroit's schools, where half of all students live in poverty, from those of Grosse Pointe, where poverty is blissfully uncommon."

We speak and write well most of the time.

There are, however, words and phrases that trip us up. Listeners, readers and our colleagues cringe at the mistakes.

This is going to be a living post. We’re starting with some of the common mistakes. There are some links to where you can get help on the proper usages. We’ll add to the list as suggestions — perhaps we should say “complaints” – come in. The hope is that if the problem cases are identified, they’ll become less common as times goes on.

– Advance planning: One of many pleonasms we should avoid.

– Anniversary: It is redundant to say “one-year” or “five-year” or “10-year” … “anniversary.”



– Begs the question: If you think that means “raises the question,” you will incur the wrath of dozens or more audience members.

– But: It’s a little word we use far too often and in ways we shouldn’t.

-- Countless: Do you really mean there are “too many to count?” Or that there’s an “indefinitely large number?” Should you be saying “hundreds” or “thousands?”



– Data: At NPR, we use plural verbs and pronouns when referring to data — unless, that is, we’re confident we’re using the word as a collective noun. Tip: If you can substitute the word “information,” that’s a sign you’re using “data” as a collective noun. If the word “numbers” is the proper substitute, than you need plural verbs and pronouns.

– Farther and further: Use “farther” when discussing distances. “Further” is for issues involving matters of degree.

– Fewer or less? Do you choose your supermarket based on what the sign says over the express aisle? Some people do. “Fewer” is the word to use when things can be counted. “Less” is to be used when when you’re talking about mass quantities.

– Interpreters and translators: An interpreter turns spoken words into another language. A translator works with written words.

– Lay and lie: Stop and check yourself before choosing between these words. Go here or here. At the very least, remember this: You lay down a book; you lie down to rest.

– Lecterns and podiums: You stand on a podium. You put your notes on a lectern, which you sit or stand behind.



– Marine, sailor, soldier: A Marine is not a soldier or a sailor. A sailor is not a Marine or a soldier. A soldier is not a sailor or a Marine. Be careful when referring to them.

– Media: NPR treats “media” as a plural.

– Percent and percentage point: When comparing changes in two percentages, the difference is expressed in “percentage points.” For example, if 36% of Little Valley Central School’s class of ’76 show up at next year’s reunion, that will be an increase of 5 percentage points from the 31% turnout 10 years ago. Attendance, though, will go up 15%. That’s because the 15 who come next year would mark a 15% increase from the 13 who attended in ’06.

– Reticent and reluctant: They do not mean the same thing. Webster’s defines reticent as “habitually silent or uncommunicative; disinclined to speak readily; reserved; taciturn” and “having a restrained, quiet or understated quality.”



– Shrink, shrank and shrunk; sink, sank and sunk: William Safire weighed in on these words back in 1995. Tip: The movie should have been called “Honey, I Shrank the Kids.”

– Vast majority: The best advice is to just not say it. You’ll probably be wrong. Use facts instead.

And here's the best part: Everything that scares Harold is something he created — that dragon may be terrifying but it's the dragon he hath made.

Paradise Lost by John Milton Paperback, 465 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

But sometimes, good doesn't win the day. Sometimes the bad guys get away with it.

And if we're going to talk about villains, let's talk about the biggest of the Big Bads, the Grand-daddy of Ghouls, the Imperator of Iniquity — Satan himself. Specifically, the version of Satan set down by John Milton in Paradise Lost.

Like a lot of kids, I first encountered Milton's Satan in high school English class. And luckily, my tenth grade English teacher Rhoda Trooboff still lives here in Washington, D.C., and is more than willing to talk Milton.

Satan doesn't just get away with it, she says, ""he brings his buddies into it. And together they form a community that sounds as they describe it, really exciting. I think that model of these really well-written villains are so compelling to the reader that they're, I hate to say it, more interesting than the good guys.""

Sure, he's been cast out of Heaven, but Satan pretty much has it made in Hell.

Milton's Satan is the ancestor of our modern antiheroes, the kinds of guys who flip the fire of damnation into a blaze of glory. But the more reading I did for this story, the more I noticed another kind of unpunished villain ... people like O'Brien, the terrifyingly calm Inner Party member in George Orwell's 1984.



""If you want a vision of the future, Winston, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever,"" O'Brien says, as he tortures protagonist Winston Smith into betraying his lover Julia.

Like death and taxes, O'Brien is inescapable. And like many successful villains, he truly believes in his cause. ""Those are the ones that tend to get away with it, because they don't get distracted,"" says fantasy author Victoria Schwab. I caught up with her at this year's San Diego Comic Con because she's kind of an expert on villains. A few years back, she set herself this challenge:

1984 by George Orwell Paperback, 328 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

""If I wrote an entire book that only had bad people, could I make you root for them as if they were the hero.""

Schwab points to villains like the nobly murderous serial killer Dexter, or the X-men's long-running antagonist — and sometimes ally — Magneto. (And yes, I know, Magneto ends up in prison a lot. But he keeps coming back).

""They have their own ethics, they have their own system, they have their own code that they're following. So even if it's not our code, the fact that they do have a code, that they're not anarchic, is something that readers and viewers find really appealing.""

And I think that's the real heart of the matter — the blackened, shriveled, eeeevil heart. Because after all, it's the readers who want to see the bad guy get his just desserts, and it's the author who dispenses the punishment.

So if you're a literary villain, here's some free advice — adopt a cause, practice your smoldering glances and your withering quips, because charming the audience is your key to getting away with it. Whatever IT happens to be."

Hey Hugh.

It's us, the sideburns you wore while you played the character Wolverine. All the times you played Wolverine. To refresh your memory: When Wolverine 3 comes out next year, we'll have been together, the three of us, for nine movies over the course of 17 years.

Seventeen years, Hugh. Do you know what anniversary that is? It's the furniture anniversary. We were gonna make you a footstool!

But then you went on Twitter on Monday, after you finished shooting Wolverine 3, and shaved us off. Just like that. Just ritually murdered us for the amusement of your 6.74 million followers.

So we imagine you're surprised to hear from us.

But you can't kill us, Hugh. Not really. We mutton chops — we're more than the follicles that make us up; we're a way of life. An attitude. An emotional state. We are eternal.

And we're here to tell you: We refuse to accept this. You owe us.

Oh sure, you were a working actor before we met. Your Curly in Oklahoma on the West End? Very impressive. We'll note here: Your character's name was Curly. Your hairstyle was essential to the character; it carried that performance.

Huh. How about that.

Life patterns start early, I guess.

But then in 2000 you got the part of Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men, replacing Dougray Scott, the man whose two names are three names.

Let's face it; casting you was a stretch. Wolverine, in the comics, is 5 feet, 3 inches. You're a full foot taller. He's Canadian; you're Australian. And yeah, you bulked up for the part, but the Wolverine of the comics is a compact ball o' muscle, and you, Hugh, even at your most burly, retain a certain stubborn ranginess.

So. Go ahead, tell yourself it was your performance that sold audiences on your Wolverine. But we know the truth. It was us. It was always us.

That's because, qua coiffures, mutton chops signify something very specific: chaos and control in perfect balance. Facial hair allowed to grow thick and bushy — pure untrammeled virility! — but only within rigid parameters. The cheeks, not the chin.

Business in the front, party on the sides.

Historically, we are worn by men who channel their aggression into prescribed outlets — military men like Gen. Ambrose Burnside, and, um, Colonel Mustard.

Wolverine is a character trained to be a weapon — a superhero whose superpower is the disemboweling of others. To be a hero, and to live among them, he must mediate his propensity for violence, he must keep his blood lust throttled.

And all of that back story? Is sitting on his cheekbones.

Yeah. You're welcome.

You sure seem glad to be rid of us. You tell everyone who'll listen how much your wife always hated us, which we'll be honest: hurtful.

But that's fine, because we're not going anywhere, Hugh. We'll always be here, just underneath the surface of your skin.

Waiting.

And we're not alone. That ridiculous bushy hobo number you sported as Jean Valjean in Les Miserables is here with us, too. And that wildly unfortunate Van Dyke from your turn as Blackbeard in Pan.

So on nights when you're drifting off to sleep, your beloved, us-hating wife in your arms, you may catch, just at the edge of hearing, our united voices raised in defiance.

We're here.

We're beard.

Get used to it.

That's ... that's what we've come up with for now, but we're ... I mean we're still workshopping it, obviously."

Kadohata is the Newbery Medal-winning author of the YA novel ""Kira-Kira."" For our ""Next Chapter"" series, she talks about an eye-opening bus trip she took across the U.S. right before she left home.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Do you remember the moment when you left home for good? This month, many young people will be experiencing that moment as they shoulder their bags and head off to college. And throughout August, we're bringing you stories and advice about that pivotal moment from authors who've written for young adults. It's a series we call Next Chapter. Today, we hear from Cynthia Kadohata. She's the Newbery Medal-winning author of ""Kira-Kira"" and ""Half A World Away."" And she says the common thread in all her books is that they focus on something that moves her.

CYNTHIA KADOHATA: I love dogs a lot, so I wrote a book called ""Cracker!"" about the dogs who served in Vietnam.

MARTIN: Kadohata was 17 years old when she dropped out of high school. For the next few years, she lived at home in LA and went to community college, then she finished her undergraduate degree at a four-year university. She was in her 20s when she decided she wanted to leave home and start a new life in Boston. The year was 1981.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""BADLANDS"")

KADOHATA: I had taken a month-long bus trip - Greyhound bus trip shortly before I left Los Angeles. And I really saw the country as I had never seen it before.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BADLANDS"")

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Lights out tonight, trouble in the heartland, got a head-on collision smashing in my guts, man. I'm caught in...

KADOHATA: For me, going on this bus trip was one of the real pivotal times in my life. I met people who I never would have ordinarily met. I was on a bus with a woman in her 80s who said she was dying, and this was going to be her last trip that she would ever take. She had lived in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl years and gone to California to pick fruit. And I was just fascinated by her life. We talked for hours on the bus, and she hugged me afterwards. I remember we were standing in, I think it was Texas somewhere, and they were grasshoppers hopping all over the parking lot. And she hugged me and told me to have a good life.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT"")

KADOHATA: And just meeting her somehow changed my whole vision of America, I think. I mean, I had always lived in America. But I didn't have an awareness, really, of being an American so much as I did when I talked to these people. And I saw that each person has their own story which is unique and incredibly valuable to hear about. And that was when I started to think that I wanted to be a writer.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

KADOHATA: You should find whatever it is you feel passionate about, and find people who inspire you, who will mentor you and help you through whatever decisions you have to make.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Well they're still racing out at the trestles. But that blood, it never burned in her veins.

MARTIN: That's Cynthia Kadohata. We've been hearing music from Bruce Springsteen's ""Darkness On The Edge of Town,"" an album Kadahota says was very important to her when she left home. She is part of our series Next Chapter.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN"")

SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Well, if she wants to see me, you can tell her that I'm easily found. Tell her there's a spot out 'neath Abram's Bridge. Tell her there's a darkness on the edge of town. There's a darkness on the edge of town.

Well, everybody's got a secret, son - something that they just can't face...

Here’s the first line of a Brian Naylor spot this morning:

“The cable TV set-top box, which is actually probably under your TV, is pretty easy to ignore.”

Brilliant. Brian winks at listeners. It’s engaging. A “real” person is reporting the news and he knows that “set-top box” is one of those phrases that lives on after it no longer makes sense. What could have been a dull report pops instead.

Imagine the other words or phrases that offer such opportunities. “Glove compartment” comes to mind. I know mine has never contained a pair of gloves.

Lou Pearlman, the impresario behind boy band giants such as the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, has died in prison while serving a 25-year sentence tied to a $300 million Ponzi scheme.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons said 62-year-old Pearlman died Friday, without specifying a cause of death.

Along with the Ponzi scheme allegations, Pearlman faced accusations of sexual misconduct against numerous young boy band members, first detailed in a 2007 Vanity Fair article.

""Some, especially the teenagers, shrugged and giggled when he showed them pornographic movies or jumped naked on their beds in the morning to wrestle and play. Others, it appears, didn't get off so easily,"" the article read. ""For any number of young men who sought to join the world's greatest boy bands, Big Poppa's attentions were an open secret, the price some paid for fame.""

Pearlman had denied the allegations.

Pearlman started in the aviation industry but shifted focus in the early '90s to music. As NPR's Rebecca Hersher told our Newscast unit, ""Pearlman created the Backstreet Boys in 1993, after funding a talent search for young musicians in the Orlando area. The quintet went on to become the best-selling boy band ever.""

He later managed other successful boy bands such as *NSYNC, LFO, Take 5 and O-Town. But as Becky reported, ""his pop empire fell apart when he was accused of pocketing the profits of his young proteges, and Florida regulators uncovered a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.""

Pearlman ""was ultimately sued by every act he represented except one,"" according to Billboard.

As Rolling Stone reported, he fled the country but was taken into custody in Bali in 2007 and ""indicted on charges of conspiracy, money laundering and making false statements.""

The elaborate scheme involved ""nearly 2,000 investors, many of them elderly Florida retirees,"" and took place over the course of 15 years, as Vanity Fair reported.

I hope he found some peace. God bless and RIP, Lou Pearlman. — Justin Timberlake (@jtimberlake) August 21, 2016

Mixed emotions right now, but RIP Lou Pearlman. — Chris Kirkpatrick (@IamCKirkpatrick) August 21, 2016

The reaction to his death from former band members hints at complicated relationships. ""I hope he found some peace. God bless and RIP, Lou Pearlman,"" wrote Justin Timberlake. ""Mixed emotions right now, but RIP Lou Pearlman,"" *NSYNC's Chris Kirkpatrick tweeted. Lance Bass of *NSYNC wrote, ""He might not have been a stand up businessman, but I wouldn't be doing what I love today [without] his influence.""

Pearlman ""clung tenaciously to the notion that he can conquer the charts once more"" during his time in prison, as The Hollywood Reporter wrote in 2014.

""I deeply regret what happened,"" he said in the interview with THR. ""And I'll be back."""

toggle caption Josh Cheuse

A member of the All Things Considered family has died. Alan Cheuse, who reviewed books on our air nearly every week since the early 1980s, passed away today after a car accident in California two weeks ago. He was 75 years old.

In two minutes every week, Alan paid his respects to good writing in his soft, intense, passionate voice.

Who ever read as much as Alan did? When he wasn't reading, he was teaching — over the years at Bennington, the University of Virginia, University of Michigan, and for the last two-plus decades, at George Mason University. And when he wasn't reading and teaching, he was writing. Five novels, novellas, short stories, textbooks.

It's a miracle that he found time for the solitude and concentration that writing demands: He was at the center of literary life in Washington, D.C., and a truly loving husband, father, and grandfather. But Alan did manage to do it all. Summers in Santa Cruz gave him solitary writing time, and time to teach at the Squaw Valley Writers Workshop. It was driving back from Northern California that he had the car accident.

Alan Cheuse was such a generous man. He always made time for his students. He always had suggestions to us, about writers to keep track of, as well as ones to avoid. He was a wonderful, caring, funny friend, full of stories and totally apt literary quotations. Good gossip too.

Those who knew him will remember him for all of that. Listeners will remember, and thank him, for all the reading in our behalf.

We welcome your memories of Alan in the comments section."

That's part of what makes Glaspy a top new artist of 2016 for many of the writers here at NPR Music.

Glaspy's new album Emotions And Math, made with her band, is a huge leap from her earlier EPs Homeschool (2012) and If & When (2013), which mostly consisted of the singer and her electric guitar. You can hear Glaspy's sharp words on those older records, but now that wit and wisdom packs a confident punch — as does her guitar playing, which is no longer simply fingerpicked, but also crunched with power chords behind a newly brazen voice.

The Tiny Desk concert provides a great example of how much power can be found in simplicity and purity. Everything serves the songs here: There's no overplaying, no frills, just great music and a tremendous new artist who sounds thrilled to be playing it.

The Clinton Foundation is working now to ""spin off"" or ""find partners"" for many of its programs, including all international activities and programs funded by foreign and corporate donors, the head of the Clinton Foundation told NPR's Peter Overby. The ""unraveling,"" which would be an attempt to prevent conflicts, would go into effect if Hillary Clinton is elected president.

It will take time to make the changes to each of the foundation's affected programs, said Clinton Foundation President Donna Shalala. ""This kind of unraveling has to be done with a scalpel so that we just do not hurt people, and do not interrupt the very good work that's being done,"" she said.

Many of the foundation's programs would become separate non-governmental organizations ""without us participating in the governance obviously,"" Shalala said. Partner organizations, she said, would also ""continue the work that was started by the Clinton Foundation.""

Founded by President Bill Clinton, the foundation has become a major player in international health and global philanthropy. In 2014, the Clinton Foundation reported $439 million in assets and $338 million in revenue, with $217 million spent on programs.

But it has also been heavily criticized for potential conflicts with the State Department under Hillary Clinton's leadership. Released emails have shown some efforts to connect donors or associates at the foundation to personnel at the State Department.

And on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported that as secretary of state, Clinton met or had phone conversations with 154 private citizens — more than half were donors or connected to entities that gave money to the foundation or its projects.

In response, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence called for the foundation to be ""immediately shut down"" and for an ""independent special prosecutor [to] be appointed to determine if access to Hillary Clinton was for sale."" Donald Trump has also called for the foundation to be shut down.

The foundation announced last week that if Hillary Clinton were to be elected, Bill Clinton would step down from the foundation board and it would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate sources. Shalala said Chelsea Clinton would remain on the board.

Shalala insisted the changes are not a reactionary move. ""We're not responding to the outside criticism,"" she said. ""I was brought in a year ago to help start thinking through what the form would take if she was elected, and the president wanted to do it very carefully.""

It would have been ""presumptuous"" to make such changes before Clinton was the nominee, Shalala said.

The Clintons could have avoided conflicts by letting an independent board of directors oversee decisions, said Leslie Lenkowsky of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. But, he said, he hasn't seen any clear evidence that foundation donors got more than small favors from Hillary Clinton's State Department. ""Unless it really gets to affecting public business, you know, it's not nice to look at and the donors shouldn't do it,"" he said. ""But you know, it happens all the time.""

""The most important thing to the president and to Chelsea is that the work continues but under different umbrellas away from the foundation, obviously, because we will not be able to accept corporate donations or international money as we have to support our programs,"" Shalala continued.

Bill Clinton ""will not be involved"" in the initiatives that are spinning off or merging with another foundation, Shalala said. He also would not do any fundraising for the foundation.

So what would remain of the foundation? ""We have some things that are funded by American foundations,"" Shalala said. She also pointed to the presidential library and Clinton center in Little Rock, Ark. ""There are elements of the Clinton Foundation that people often don't think about that stay forever.""

If Clinton wins the election, Bill Clinton will not have any official connection to the foundation, Shalala said, but ""I'm sure he's going to go visit his library."""

Asali Solomon's novel is about a girl growing up in West Philadelphia whose parents were black nationalists. ""My parents taught us to revere Africa,"" she says. Originally broadcast Feb. 5, 2015.

DAVE DAVIES, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Today we're going to listen to Terry's interview with Asali Solomon, whose novel's about a girl growing up in the '80s the daughter of black nationalist, Afrocentric parents. The book, ""Disgruntled,"" is now out in paperback. Its main character, Kenya, feels like an outsider in her neighborhood school in West Philadelphia because she's such a dedicated student. But when she's sent to a private school, she's an outsider because she's one of the few African-American students. She feels guilty she's not measuring up to the model she thinks she's supposed to be portraying, the brilliant black girl, heir to those brave children in the South who'd shine their shoes each morning, only to get kicked and spat on in their fight for a good education. Many of the suburban white students assume everyone in Kenya's neighborhood is on welfare.

The novel's rich with observations about race, class, the impact of divorce on a child and growing up with a father sometimes uses his politics to justify irresponsible behavior. ""Disgruntled"" is Asali Solomon's first novel. Her previous book, ""Get Down,"" is a collection of short stories. In 2007, she was named one of the National Book Foundation's 5 under 35. She teaches English literature and creative writing at Haverford College. Terry spoke to her last year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Asali Solomon, welcome to FRESH AIR. I'm going to ask you to read from the very beginning of your novel.

ASALI SOLOMON: OK, thank you. So here we go.

(Reading) In the first grade at Henry Charles Lea School in West Philadelphia, when Kenya told kids that she celebrated Kwanzaa, no one knew what she was talking about. By the third grade, led by the tiny tyrant L'Tisha Simmons, the kids were calling her an African booty scratcher and chanting to a conga line rhythm, you don't get no presents. You don't get no presents. In fact, she did get presents on the last morning of Kwanzaa, seven days after Christmas. By the fourth grade, Kenya was down to one friend. It wasn't just the Kwanzaa problem. And anyway, she could have lied about Kwanzaa like she suspected Fatima McCullers did - Fatima, whose dad had dreadlocks and who always said Christmas and Santa Claus with a wavering inflection.

It was also that she couldn't eat any pork, including the bologna sandwiches that were the everyday fare of the lunch room - something to do with her father muttering that white people forced slaves to eat hog guts. Though, as far as Kenya could see, white people loved bologna enough to give it both a first and a second name. It was that she wasn't allowed to watch ""Gimme A Break!,"" ""Good Times,"" or ""Diff'rent Strokes"" because according to her mother, watching black people on TV acting the fool was worse than not watching any at all. It was that she was forbidden to actually speak the Pledge of Allegiance and had been directed to mouth it with her hand not actually touching her chest. It was that she had to call her father Baba. And when she'd asked if she could call him daddy like other people, it had triggered what seemed like days of lectures, during which Kenya learned to hate the phrase other people. It was that while her parents said grace like normal people, they directed it to the creator instead of God.

GROSS: And that's Asali Solomon reading from her new novel, ""Disgruntled."" Does any of this describe how you were raised?

SOLOMON: So yeah, some of the things - we celebrated Kwanzaa. I don't know that my parents, like, specifically forbade us to say the Pledge of Allegiance. But there was something about that. Like, we should not be saying the Pledge of Allegiance. Like, it was a farce. We didn't eat pork, although the reason for that was never quite explained to me. Like, even much later I was like, why didn't we eat pork? Well, it's not good for you. But I think maybe my parents didn't like it. But it was part of a thing at the time that I think people were taking from black Muslims. And it was also true that when I went to public school in West Philadelphia, I was not in the majority. Like - but the lifestyle I was leading was different from what other people were leading, you know? Like, my parents taught us to revere Africa. People at school made fun of Africa. So a lot of things like that were true.

GROSS: Did your parents consider themselves black nationalists or Afrocentric?

SOLOMON: Yeah, they - I think they considered themselves black nationalists. But the phrase black nationalist, I think, implies a level of action that doesn't necessarily describe them. So it was that they thought about themselves as being a part of an entity that was black people in America - right? - as opposed to just thinking of oneself as an American and thinking of oneself as necessarily kind of in opposition to kind of mainstream America. And as for being Afrocentric, I mean, they named my sister and I - they gave us African names. We celebrated Kwanzaa, which is not an African holiday. It's an African-American holiday. But it is based on a reverence for and a connection to Africa. So in that way - yeah.

GROSS: You know, one of the things I just really enjoyed about reading your novel is I'm always so interested in what it's like for the children of parents who have carved out a way of being different, who are consciously, like, rejecting mainstream culture and have this kind of alternate philosophy, whether it's Afrocentrism or being, you know - not that these two are the equivalent of - or being a hippie or, like, rejecting religion...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...Or being politically radical or whatever - you know, to have, like, their own culture or counterculture. And for the children, who didn't choose that and who might feel different from the other children in their school or their neighborhood, to grow up in that - and what it makes them feel - peculiar or different, as a result of - and your book is just filled with insights about that, I think.

SOLOMON: Right. And I think that depending on the things your parents ask you to do - the kind of sacrifices they ask you to make - it can be empowering to know that, you know, the reason you feel like you're not at ease can be explained by these things - versus - I think almost everybody feels like, at a certain point, particularly during the process of coming age, that they are not at ease. They don't fit in but have no (laughter) reason for that. Oh, there must be something wrong with me - you know, kind of a thing. So there can be something strengthening about it. But also, you know, when all you really want to do is fit in, then it can be very difficult.

GROSS: And I was thinking about that reading your book. Like, in the reading that you did, you mention the shows that the mother in the book didn't want the kid to watch...

SOLOMON: Oh, yeah, that was - I forgot. So that was a thing in our house, as well.

GROSS: ...Because black people are acting like fools on it...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...Better not to see anything. And then one of Kenya's parent's friends says to Kenya, why are you watching ""The Muppets?"" There's no black Muppets...

SOLOMON: Yeah, right (laughter).

GROSS: Like, you shouldn't be watching this.

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: And it just made me think about how consciousness-raising, when you're doing it with children...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...Also comes with all these prescriptions of things that you can't do that are going to...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...Like, remove you from other people of your age and from the popular culture of the time, even if the racially conscious perceptions about that culture might be accurate. But it's still - you're just a kid...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...When parents are telling you that.

SOLOMON: No. And I mean, you know, I went to kindergarten and definitely told some people Santa Claus didn't exist. And (laughter) you know, I - yeah, those television shows - I mean, it wasn't so much that I was forbidden to watch those television shows. But, you know, it was kind of frowned upon to be watching a lot of those television shows. And I - you know, I had a breakdown for each of them, why they were nefarious, you know? And it is very hard to be a child living a righteous (laughter) lifestyle, you know, and explain that to your friends and still be a part of things.

GROSS: The parents in the novel are always referring to the word the community and all the things they need to do for the community. Did your parents use that expression? And what did it mean in your family?

SOLOMON: They did. They - you know, they would talk about the community. And that meant black people. And more closely, it meant working-class black people in Philadelphia or, you know, just black people in Philadelphia. I mean, I guess the thing that was funny about it is that was one of those things that I didn't think was particularly exotic until much later, when I realized that other people did not go around talking about the community and what we needed to do for the community. But again, what it meant was that we were part of this entity. And we should always sort of be bearing in mind how we were representing that entity or what we were doing for that entity.

GROSS: In the novel, the main character's parents and a group of the parents' friends form a group called the Seven Days. And it's inspired by a Toni Morrison novel called ""Song Of Solomon."" I want you to explain the connection between the Toni Morrison novel and the Seven Days group.

SOLOMON: So in ""Song of Solomon,"" Milkman is the main character of the novel. And it's basically a quest novel, where Milkman is kind of trying to find himself. He has a best friend named Guitar, who joins a radical group called the Seven Days. And the Seven Days - essentially, when they hear of a black person who's been murdered, they go out and murder an equivalent white person in an equivalent way.

And, I mean, I think what Morrison was trying to do in that novel is explore the lure of violence. Like, it seems like a good way to assert black humanity, in a way, and a good way to get back at oppression. But by the end, I think, you know, the novel seems to come to the conclusion that that is crazy. And it will drive you crazy. And by the end of the novel, Guitar is quite insane and possibly trying to murder Milkman. The Seven Days in the book is a group where Johnbrown and Sheila, who don't agree on a lot in terms of...

GROSS: Those are the parents...

SOLOMON: Yeah - who often don't agree on things like what they're reading, have both read and love this novel. And they have this idea for a group called the Seven Days. And originally, Johnbrown really wants it to be a combination of sort of service to the community and acts of anarchy and not violent but kind of aggressive acts. But it becomes that the parents and their friends do these acts of community service, you know, one day a week, kind of like the Seven Days. So that's the connection there.

GROSS: Was service an issue in your family? Was that emphasized in your family?

SOLOMON: Yes, it was. I mean, my parents worked hard. So they didn't have tons of leisure time. But it was more of a thing - like, going to marches, going to rallies. There were different kinds of things that they did. My mother started a group called Sisters Remember Malcolm. And she and some friends of hers had this organization that every year would throw a commemorative program honoring Malcolm X. And this was in the days when Malcolm X was a lot less well-known than he is today. We also - I mean, one of the things in the novel that's based in truth is that we did go around giving Kwanzaa programs. I would call it the Kwanzaa von Trapp family.

(LAUGHTER)

SOLOMON: Because we would go - you know, we'd been to the library. We'd go to schools. And, I mean, it was torture. I mean, ironically, now I do this at my son's day care but - go around doing that. So there were things that we did, yeah, for the community.

GROSS: Do you still celebrate Kwanzaa with your children?

SOLOMON: I do. I mean, in my house - I married a Jewish man. And we celebrate everything except Christmas.

(LAUGHTER)

SOLOMON: So we celebrate - but it's like - I mean, this year, it was like 15 days of madness, you know?

GROSS: (Laughter).

SOLOMON: It was just like it doesn't stop. But yeah, we celebrate Kwanukkah (ph).

GROSS: (Laughter).

SOLOMON: But, yeah.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Asali Solomon. And her novel is called ""Disgruntled."" Let's take a short break here. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Asali Solomon. We're talking about her novel ""Disgruntled.""

The father in your novel sees himself as a radical force for social change. And he sees himself as a philosopher. And he's writing his great text, which is called ""The Key."" And he describes it as a contemporary work of black philosophy that would also be a way of living for non-black peoples who were enlightened. It would draw on classical thought, as well as West African and Native American ways of knowing. It would unite Du Bois, Ellison, Cleaver, Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X - very, very ambitious work. But the father is really a mix of radical politics, philosophy and a lot of B.S.

SOLOMON: (Laughter). Yeah.

GROSS: (Laughter) Because, you know, he's never going to finish this work.

SOLOMON: No.

GROSS: And the work is really - what's the right word to use to describe it?

SOLOMON: Bombastic?

GROSS: That's good.

SOLOMON: I mean, just...

GROSS: Confusing.

SOLOMON: Confusing.

GROSS: A mess.

SOLOMON: Yeah, a way of not living his life.

GROSS: And of not being responsible to the people in his life.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: Because there's always this, like, great text that's more important than we are...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...That he's working on.

SOLOMON: I mean, the father is - it's funny because more than necessarily being a type of a black father, he's definitely a type of a man (laughter), you know, in a lot of ways. And actually, I didn't realize this - I was writing it. And then in the middle of writing it, I reread the novel ""Middlemarch."" And there's a key in ""Middlemarch,"" right? So, Dorothea, who's one of the protagonists in ""Middlemarch,"" marries this older man who she reveres for his mind. But he's always, you know, in his library writing ""The Key To All Mythology"" - I think it's called.

And I think that sort of impressed me, like, this thought that, you know, their lives should be sacrificed for this thing that was never going to see the light of day that no one really cared about, but, you know, was meant to be so meaningful. And Dorothea had to, like, bring him tea. But she wasn't allowed to talk to him at certain times of day. So I think I was sort of thinking about that when I thought of ""The Key."" But yeah, it becomes a way of him just sort of being involved with his own mind and revering his own mind versus living with other people and taking their concerns into account.

GROSS: Were you exposed to people like that, who thought of themselves as being great minds and great philosophers? And you would assume that they were a genius because you never got to see the work? Do you know, like...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...It's easy to be brilliant when nobody sees the brilliant thing that you're working on.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: I've known that person.

SOLOMON: Yeah. You know, it's funny. I can't think of anybody I've known like that personally. The one thing that - and this is not - my father is not Johnbrown by any stretch of the imagination. But he was a songwriter. And it was not his vocation, it was his passion. And he spent a lot of time in the living room playing the piano. And then at one point, he had a studio in the basement. And so he spent a lot of time doing that. But I don't think of it in this way - like, he was working on some nonsense that, you know, he thought was going to change the world or anything like that. But I think the image of a male figure in the house, like, working away on something separate from other parts of the house may have come into that.

GROSS: Books play a really interesting part in your novel because there's a group that's inspired - a group the parents form that's inspired by a Toni Morrison novel. The father is hard at work on this philosophical tome that he'll never finish. No one will ever read it.

(LAUGHTER)

GROSS: It's not going to amount to anything. And the mother is introduced to Audre Lorde. And Audre Lorde, who's a lesbian, feminist author - let me just quote what the mother says to the daughter in this. She says, (reading) I'm not going for that gay stuff. But everything else that this sister said is all right by me. And the father says, (reading) oh, she's probably just an FBI informant.

SOLOMON: (Laughter) Right.

GROSS: And the mother says, (reading) well, she's certainly informed me about why I'm not ironing your shirts or pouring your cereal anymore.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: That strikes me as such a kind of - I've heard that argument, you know? Like, you read a book. You change your mind. And you argue about who you're going to be after that and what you're going to do or not do. And I'm wondering if you were exposed to that as a child - to that kind of argument based on ideas - on new ideas - that the adults were getting exposed to that were changing their sense of who they were and what they wanted out of life. And you were maybe seeing this but too young to really grasp what was going on.

SOLOMON: Yeah, I mean, so I don't remember anything like that. There's a funny thing in there which is that my mother, as far as I can remember, has been a feminist. And that was another thing that I didn't realize was slightly unusual in a household like mine. I mean - but also, I think a lot of working-class black women and educated black women - my mother is educated - both my parents are - and went to college - are feminists but wouldn't articulate it as such. Whereas my mother would pretty much articulate it as such. She would always say things like - people talk about when we got married. She'd say, if you get married, you know, and talk about a lot of things as a choice. Or she would always tell this story of a friend of hers who was raising a child on her own. And somebody would say, oh, you know, you need a husband. And then the friend would say, no, I need a wife. So she was very conscious of the hierarchy of gender and these kinds of things.

GROSS: You mentioned that if you said, when I get married, your mother would say, if you get married...

SOLOMON: That's right.

GROSS: ...And make it clear you had a choice. You didn't have to get married.

SOLOMON: Right, right.

GROSS: I hope I'm not giving away too much here - the child in your book, Kenya, finds out her parents actually never got married - that the father felt like, I don't need the government in our relationship. I don't need a certificate to tell me how I feel or what I should do. And I'm interested in why you created the couple not being married and if that was an issue around you when you were growing up.

SOLOMON: So a funny thing is that one time my mom - I don't know what we were doing. I don't know. She sat me down. We were sitting there. And she said, you know, your father and I aren't married. And I was like, really? And she's like, yeah. And I'm struggling because I'm thinking, like, well, my mom is the one who told me not to say illegitimate. It doesn't matter. But at the same time, it kind of does matter. She was lying. This was some kind of weird prank. (Laughter) Like, you know, just to see what you would say, you know - (laughter) and so I think what I'm doing in the book is thinking about - in that moment, I felt like something dropped away, even though I wasn't - I had been taught not to feel that way. I had been taught not to be invested in this foolishness. But...

GROSS: But it could've been true in the sense that it would've fit into...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...A larger philosophy. I've certainly known plenty of people...

SOLOMON: Yeah.

GROSS: ...Who decided not to get married, in spite of the fact that they were having children, or got married only because they were having children or after they had children.

SOLOMON: No, in...

GROSS: But you never know how the children are going to feel about that.

SOLOMON: Well, so I mean - and then the other - so it did take me a while to figure out, for example, that, like, the anniversary of my parents' marriage and my birth date didn't really line - like, my mom's pregnant when they got married. Like, you can see it in the pictures. Like, but, you know, for years, I'd been looking at those pictures without the recognition of that. But neither of my parents would've - they probably would not have had children without getting married. I mean, they came from households that were - my mother's parents were not at all traditional people.

But I think my grandmother could be kind of a hardliner about certain things like that. I mean, again, my grandmother was, like, the original black working-class feminist. You know, she didn't need to learn about these things in classes - about equality, about being forthright, about telling men and people exactly what she thought. But I think she believed that you should get married. And my father's parents actually never married. But I think he would've felt like he was doing a disservice to his mother by not marrying a woman who was pregnant with his child. And they claimed they wanted to get married anyway. That's what they always say.

DAVIES: Asali Solomon's book ""Disgruntled"" is now out in paperback. After a break, we'll hear more of her story. Also, Kevin Whitehead will review some previously unreleased Charlie Parker. And John Powers tells us about the new comedy ""War Dogs"" starring Jonah Hill. I'm Dave Davies. And this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're listening to Terry's interview with Asali Solomon, the author of ""Disgruntled,"" a novel about race, class, identity and the impact of divorce on a child. It's told from the point of view of a girl named Kenya, growing up in the '80s in West Philadelphia the daughter of black nationalist, Afrocentric parents. ""Disgruntled"" is now out in paperback.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: So one of the family issues in the book that really breaks up the family is that the father in the novel ends up having an affair with one of the mother's good friends...

SOLOMON: One of the Seven Days.

GROSS: ...Who's also a member of the group the Seven Days. And this woman gets pregnant with Kenya's father. And so Kenya's father makes this offer to Kenya and her mother that they could just expand the family and welcome in, you know, this other person and this other person's baby. Would you read that passage from your novel?

SOLOMON: Sure. So this is Johnbrown, the father, talking to Sheila and Kenya after Sheila discovers he's been having an affair.

GROSS: And Sheila is...

SOLOMON: The mother - Kenya's mother.

GROSS: Kenya's mother, yep.

SOLOMON: (Reading) With your permission, Sheila and Kenya, I'd like for Cindalou and the baby to move in here. I'd like for us all to be a family. What did you say? Sheila asked. She dabbed at her mouth with a napkin and looked genuinely as if she hadn't heard, as if she was asking for a small clarification. Did you say cream or sugar? Lemonade - you want me to pass the lemonade? Well, Cindalou and I have been going to some events at the Yoruba temple, and - oh, you actually go out of the house? Glad to hear that. And I don't think the temple is for me. I mean, organized religion is organized religion. But some of the families in the traditional African - get back to the point. So you want to move that bitch and her bastard up in here where I pay the mortgage? I'm not understanding what this has to do with the temple because from what I know about traditional West African polygamy - Lord Jesus have mercy - the man supports the family. No, brother. I make the money. And here she laughed. What you're proposing is pimping. And I am not a whore.

GROSS: Thank you for reading that. And that's Asali Solomon reading from her new novel, ""Disgruntled."" I love the way - he's gotten this woman pregnant. He wants to, like, move her in, with this new baby, into the family and basically be polygamist. And he's got this philosophy that's going to justify it. It's not like he was philandering. You know what I'm saying?

SOLOMON: (Laughter).

GROSS: He was being disloyal or unfaithful. It's like, no, no, it's like African tradition of polygamy. And it's - you know - I - there's the hippie version of that, too. (Laughter).

SOLOMON: Oh, yes, of course, of course.

GROSS: There's the white hippie version of that.

SOLOMON: Yeah, that's not - that's not specific to - I mean, you know, this scenario is specific to black people. But I don't think that impulse to sort of, like, rationalize your behavior with, you know, some greater philosophy is, you know - I think that's a universal desire. But I also want to say, just as a side note, that, apparently, is my father's favorite scene in the book.

GROSS: Really?

SOLOMON: He thought that was hilarious.

(LAUGHTER)

SOLOMON: He laughs just talking about it. So I'm glad I got a chance to read it.

GROSS: But I'm interested in hearing why you wanted a scene like that - why you thought that the next step for this character who's writing this great philosophical text that's, in some ways, just removing him from any responsibility 'cause he's always busy writing this great philosophical text - why the next step would be this elaborate philosophical justification for his philandering.

SOLOMON: Yeah. I mean, Johnbrown's activism and his philosophy has an interesting relationship to his personal story, which is that he had these distant, mean, snobby parents who wanted him to be, you know, respectable middle-class in this way that, ultimately, is racially self-loathing. And it hurt him. And so a lot of what he does is reasonable on some level, you know, considering racism and police brutality and these kinds of things. But on some levels, it's extended acting out against his parents. And so he feels justified in making these moves that are kind of self-serving through this political, you know - through a sort of political rationalization. And so it starts with this extended acting out against his parents. And it continues with this kind of thing, you know - acting out in his family life in the family that he's built.

GROSS: Did you know people who tried to justify breaking monogamy with, you know, elaborate philosophical...

SOLOMON: I don't know anybody personally. But I have certainly heard that - you know, certainly heard that it's not natural, you know? I mean - and so, like, you keep saying the hippie version. But, you know, it's not natural for men to be monogamous. And so I've heard people talk about them in sense of thinking about African families and people who are not sort of properly interested in what that polygamy looks like, which is what Sheila points out - but just generally thinking, like, well, you know, I - mixing just their desire to - with something that's broader, you know, and more profound.

GROSS: The daughter in your novel - the main character, Kenya - ends up going to a private school in Philadelphia's Main Line that's in Bryn Mawr?

SOLOMON: That's right.

GROSS: And - As you did.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: And for her, it's this - it's a kind of life-changing experience, both in terms of this new form of alienation that she's never experienced before - but also, she gets a terrific education there. And how - like, what was going to a predominately white private school like for you?

SOLOMON: So it was obviously alienating in a lot of ways. I mean, I certainly got an excellent education. But I guess it took me a long time to understand the mix of feelings I have about that. It's something I've written about a lot and thought about a lot because the school - it was a great school. It was, you know - aesthetically, it was beautiful. We got to do - I got to do so many things, you know? But I always felt just kind of cold and out of it there. I often felt just kind of cold and out of it.

And there were things that were clearly - you know, that could clearly explain this. Like, you know, people really would ask me questions about the city. Like, were there pools of blood on the ground? And people would say things that were either subtly or not-so-subtly racist. And class was a big issue, right? A lot of the kids were wealthy. And we weren't poor, but we weren't wealthy. We didn't have a lot of money. And, you know, that was just something that was always there, you know? I was very nervous about people coming to my house, which, in a lot of cases, they were not even allowed to do 'cause they weren't allowed to, like, come to West Philadelphia.

But I think that - recently, I thought - I was thinking about how to articulate it. And I would say that in that situation, I and a lot of the other black students were just marginal because we were black. We would never be at the core of the social experience of that school, I felt, because we were black. And that sense only would increase as - I mean, I didn't go to high school there. But I imagine it would have only increased as people got into dating 'cause they weren't going to be dating out there, you know?

GROSS: Well, in the novel, the girl's thinking everybody's doing everything possible to separate her from the white boys.

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: And you get the feeling everybody in her family...

SOLOMON: Right.

GROSS: ...As well as people in the school - 'cause her parents don't want her dating somebody who's white.

SOLOMON: Yeah. Well - but then the other part of it is that there were black boys - and this was the case, you know, when I went to Baldwin - there were black boys sort of on the scene, you know? But they were not interested either. You know, I mean, there was this phenomenon that would occur when I went to school dances that I think I've documented pretty extensively, where you would have a sprinkling of black students. But the black boys did not want anybody to know that they were black. They would - you, like, by asking a black girl to - like, if you asked a black girl to dance, that would be like admitting that you were black. Obviously, they were black. It was, you know - but they couldn't ask a white girl to dance because there was something off about that. So they would often ask, like, sort of ethnically indeterminate girls...

GROSS: (Laughter).

SOLOMON: ...To dance, you know what I mean (laughter)? You know - but this kind of weird politicking that would go on. So it was - yeah. So, I mean - and so, like, I imagine - so in middle school, you know, there's not so much dating. And it's not really such - so much about a kind of sexual hierarchy. There are other things. But it's very difficult to fit in when you're just different and, you know, you can't afford or your parents won't buy the same things that everybody else is wearing. You're not going on ski trips. And, you know, it's just - everyone just thinks of you as different because you're black. But they're never saying it.

GROSS: Do you think you were exposed to ideas and books that you wouldn't have been exposed to had you stayed in a neighborhood public school?

SOLOMON: Yes, definitely. I mean, that's just - you know, I remember reading ""Jane Eyre"" in sixth grade. And then later, you know, I read it in high school. And I already read that. And I started taking French in fourth grade. I mean, sure - that definitely happened.

GROSS: And that's a good thing?

SOLOMON: Yeah. It was a good thing. It was a good thing. But it's very - I mean, it's - the thing that's difficult about, quote, unquote, ""good schools"" where you feel alienated or socially marginal is that depending on who you are as a person, you can make it out of that, you know, and write fiction about it (laughter) - write fiction about the pain you experienced in that. But a different kind of person won't necessarily get the benefit of the education because they're so broken as a person by that experience. So that's a kind of risk there.

GROSS: So your name, Asali, is a Swahili word for honey. So your parents intentionally gave you an African name. When it came time for you to name your children, how did you decide what level of symbolism you wanted those names to have?

SOLOMON: So they both have African names. I have a son, Adebayo - his name is Yoruba. It's apparently a somewhat popular name in Nigeria. A funny story about that is I have a British friend who said, oh - and it means born at a joyful time - and he said, oh, to us, it means bratty, overpaid, you know, football player (laughter), you know, 'cause in Europe - in England - like, apparently there are football - soccer players named Adebayo. But Oncale means ancestor. That's Swahili. And they both have my last name for their middle name. And their last name is Friedman. It's a Jewish name. So it's kind of all in there.

GROSS: Great.

(LAUGHTER)

GROSS: It's been wonderful to talk with you. Thank you so much.

SOLOMON: Thank you.

While every artist is special, it's rare to have a true legend come through.

Eddie Palmieri is that once-in-a-lifetime musician, bandleader, composer and arranger. An icon for both modern and Latin jazz, he continues to break tradition and innovate within many musical styles, including salsa, fusion, Latin funk and more.

His parents were born in Puerto Rico and later moved to New York City; Eddie Palmieri was born in Spanish Harlem and grew up in the Bronx with a large family that nurtured his musical talent. He studied classical piano when he was young and gave a piano recital at Carnegie Hall when he was just 11. But all he wanted to do at that time was play the drums. When he was 13, he joined his uncle's orchestra to play timbales. He later gave up the drums and started playing piano in the early 1950s in various Latin dance bands, working with Eddie Forrester, Johnny Segui and the popular Tito Rodriguez Orchestra. You can hear his continued passion for the sticks in the percussive vamps that pervade his discography.

Recorded in 1962, Perfecta was the first of nearly 50 albums Eddie Palmieri has released. The Sun Of Latin Music, a groundbreaking album released in 1975, won him the first-ever Grammy for Best Latin Recording. He later went on to win nine more Grammys, along with a host of other prestigious honors.

It was an honor to have Eddie Palmieri perform at the Tiny Desk in a special, intimate setting — without his usual big-band accompaniment. We get close enough to hear him growl; you can check out the iconic sound he's been making since his early recordings. He's said it's his inner spirit coming out to help him play. The first composition here, ""Iraida,"" was written for his wife, who died several years ago. The second, ""The Persian Scale,"" is a rare treat — a tune you won't find on any of his recordings. The set closes with ""La Libertad,"" a statement on social justice and poverty from the classic Vamonos Pa'l Monte album, released in the early '70s. Even without the band, the audience clapped and danced as the musician played his freeform dance music, deeply rooted in beautiful yet simple chord changes and his signature Afro-Cuban rhythmic style.

The Sun Of Latin Music is available now (iTunes) (Amazon).

Give Rolling Stone some credit for transparency. Sean Penn’s account of his trip to meet Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán is topped with this editor’s note:

“Disclosure: Some names have had to be changed, locations not named, and an understanding was brokered with the subject that this piece would be submitted for the subject’s approval before publication. The subject did not ask for any changes.”

There’s a good discussion to be had about the line between activism and journalism and how far across it the “El Chapo Speaks” piece goes. Let’s set that aside for now.

This post is about two simpler issues.

First, NPR does not create pseudonyms for sources. Doing so gives the audience a reason to ask what else might have been made up. If we need to protect someone’s identity, we most often use real first names, sometimes real middle names, sometimes real “street” or nicknames that the source is known by and sometimes descriptions (the “husband,” the “sister,” the “officer,” etc.). Whatever we do, we explain it in our reports. We include the reason why the person needs anonymity.

We also pay attention to “the ‘don’ts’ of anonymity.” That is, no attacks, no disguises and no offers. The Ethics Handbook’s guidance on anonymous sourcing is collected here. Of particular importance is this guideline: “Describe Anonymous Sources As Clearly As You Can Without Identifying Them.”

Second, NPR does not show its stories to sources before broadcast or posting. Here is our guidance:

“For purposes of accuracy and fairness, there are times when we may want to review portions of a script with a source or read back a quotation to ensure we captured it correctly. We may also play audio or read transcripts of an interview to a third party if the purpose is to get that party’s reaction to what another person has said. Otherwise, however, the public is the first audience for our work — we don’t preview scripts or stories in advance of their broadcast or posting with sources, subjects of coverage or other parties outside NPR.”

With 76 days to go before the election, Hillary Clinton is busy doing closed-door fundraisers. David Greene talks to Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-OH, about whether Clinton needs more contact with voters.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Let's look at Hillary Clinton's schedule this week - could always change last minute, of course. But from last Saturday to this Saturday, there is one public appearance planned in Reno, Nev., one TV appearance. That was last night with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Clinton made light of conspiracy theories about her health.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!"")

JIMMY KIMMEL: Usually, you have to die to get that.

(LAUGHTER)

HILLARY CLINTON: Yes, that's true. Well, you know, I'm on the brink.

(LAUGHTER)

GREENE: But every other Clinton event this week involves fundraising. She's attending multiple closed-door donor events each day. And this seems to play into Donald Trump's narrative that Hillary Clinton has sold out to big money. Here's a new ad released by the Republican National Committee mocking Clinton's summer plans.

(SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, ""HILLARY CLINTON'S LIBERAL ELITE SUMMER TOUR"")

UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: Welcome aboard Hillary Clinton's Liberal Elite Summer Tour, with frequent stops in Beverly Hills, Hollywood and Cape Cod. Please use caution in opening the overhead bins, as Hillary's baggage may have shifted during flight.

GREENE: OK, joining me now from Columbus, Ohio - Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who is a surrogate for the Clinton campaign. Senator, good morning, and welcome back to the program.

SHERROD BROWN: Good. Good to be back. Thank you, David.

GREENE: So I just look at the schedule this week for Hillary Clinton. I mean, she's mingling with Cher, Magic Johnson, Justin Timberlake - $27,000-a-plate dinners. I mean, then you listen to that RNC ad saying she's making these stops in Beverly Hills, Hollywood. I mean, doesn't this make her politically vulnerable?

BROWN: Well, everything makes everybody politically vulnerable...

GREENE: Does it (laughter)?

BROWN: In this 24-hour news cycle. But, I mean, look at what we're looking at. The Koch brothers - there's an incredible book out by Jane Mayer called ""Dark Money"" just talking about the far-right and the John Birch Society and the Koch brothers and the billionaires who are after Hillary Clinton and after progressive Democrats generally.

GREENE: OK.

BROWN: And Citizens United - the Supreme Court - the conservatives on the Supreme Court...

GREENE: But I'm not talking about big money on the right.

BROWN: But we know all that. We know that the only way to fight back against the 900 million - the Koch brothers promised $900 million into this election.

GREENE: OK.

BROWN: The only way to fight back against the oil interests and the NRA and the tobacco companies and the billionaires in Milwaukee and New York and California and Texas...

GREENE: Is to do these kinds of events, you say?

BROWN: ...Are to raise money. I mean, you can't just unilaterally disarm. You know that. You've watched the kind of money that the far-right - it used to be Birchers - John Birch Society - the far-right. Now they're just the political far-right, the Tea Party crowd, funded...

GREENE: OK. OK, so let's...

BROWN: Of course Hillary has to raise money to push back - of course.

GREENE: So she needs to raise money, you're saying. And she needs to hold a lot of events like this. But what about public events? I mean, I have watched...

BROWN: She's going to do plenty of public events. The public pays a little less attention around the time of the Olympics. I was just - Hillary was just 10 miles from my house in Cleveland, Ohio, last week at John Marshall High School, talking to - meeting with students, meeting with others.

GREENE: OK.

BROWN: She's doing public events - maybe not enough for NPR. But she's doing public events.

GREENE: Well, it doesn't matter to us how many events she does. We're just covering the ones she does do.

BROWN: Well, apparently, it does. But that's OK.

GREENE: (Laughter) No, it matters to some voters, I would imagine. I mean, don't...

BROWN: Well, she's going to be doing plenty of public events. And she's been out for the last two years doing lots of public events. She'll continue to do public events. This is one-week snapshot in time that Donald Trump has talked about.

The NRC - the RNC - because they have so little to talk about. And the media wants to cover that. And I don't blame...

GREENE: You can say unequivocally that, I mean, during the Olympics, this was a low period. She's focusing on fundraising. We're going to be seeing a lot more of Hillary Clinton - a lot more public events coming soon.

BROWN: No question - there's - I was in Connecticut one day last in 2012. And somebody said, you know, we're sick and tired - every four years, there's a race for president in Ohio. I mean, she's going to be in Ohio a lot. She'll be in Florida a lot. She'll be all over the country a lot.

GREENE: Can you see why some people might see this - at least a snapshot like this as a bit undemocratic if you have a candidate who's not actually interacting all that much with voters?

BROWN: What I see is how hard it is to see the retreats that the Koch brothers do, where they sit around and outbid each other for who's going to write bigger checks to the Republican Party and to Donald Trump and his crowd. And those are behind closed doors. Granted, Hillary's raising money everywhere.

But you've got to fight back. And when they're - the difference here is Hillary Clinton wants to see Citizens United overturned, which is the court case that unleashed the billionaires. And Donald Trump wants to protect Citizens United. That's fundamentally the difference.

GREENE: Senator, I want to just ask you - I mean, it's - last night in Akron, Ohio, Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton is taking care of donors instead of the American people. I just want to play a little clip of that.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Pay the Clinton Foundation huge sums of money, and throw in some big speaking fees for Bill Clinton. And you got to play. You got to do what you wanted to do.

GREENE: This is in your state. I mean, wouldn't it help to have her out there now, I mean, fighting back against Donald Trump's message?

BROWN: Of course, I would like no money to have to be raised in political campaigns. We all would. And she's out there. But - and she is going to talk about this. She has a very specific trade policy on what to do to fix NAFTA and PNTR with China.

You know, all these years, when I was out helping to lead the charge against NAFTA, against PNTR, against the Bush trade policy - trade policies under presidents of both parties - CAFTA, South Korea trade policy - I never heard Donald Trump. I never saw Donald Trump.

I'm sitting in my office in Columbus. The suit I'm wearing is made by union workers 10 miles from my house in Cleveland. Yet Donald Trump outsources his suits to Mexico, his ties to China.

GREENE: OK.

BROWN: He could buy his glassware in Toledo, his furniture in Archbold, Ohio, instead of buying it...

GREENE: (Laughter) Senator, we'll have to stop there with your list. I apologize. We're out of time. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democratic senator from Ohio. Thanks for joining us, sir.

BROWN: Thanks, David. All right.

Did Myanmar hold its “most free elections in decades?”

No, as a listener told us, it held its “freest elections in decades.”

Today’s question: When should we use more or most instead of -er or -est to form comparatives and superlatives?

To figure out the answer, it helps to count syllables.

Fowler’s Modern English Usage says that “adjectives of one or two syllables normally form their comparative and superlative forms by adding –er and –est. … Adjectives of more than two syllables are normally preceded by more or most …”

The BBC puts it this way: “It is clear that adjectives of one syllable normally end in -er and –est in their comparative and superlative forms whilst the comparative and superlative of adjectives with three or more syllables are formed with more and most.”

The Chicago Manual of Style agrees. It notes, however, that “a few one-syllable adjectives – such as real, right, and wrong – can take only more and most. … Eager, proper, and somber, unlike many two-syllable adjectives, also take only more and most.” It sagely advises consulting “a good dictionary.” (NPR uses Webster’s New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition.)

Finally, in 1925 my great uncle Frederick Memmott and fellow educator Nell Young, in the sixth grade edition of their textbooks Good English in Speaking and Writing, told students that “nearly all our adjectives containing only one syllable are compared by adding the syllables -er and -est. Some of our adjectives containing two or more syllables are compared by adding -er and -est, but others require the use of the words more and most. All the adjectives containing more than two syllables require the use of more and most in comparing things.”

There you go. If the adjective has one or two syllables, you almost always add –er and –est. When there are three or more syllables, more and most are almost certainly the words to choose. Check the dictionary if you’re not sure.

Uncle Frederick died 32 years before I was born. I don’t know this for sure, but I trust he would have thanked us for keeping these guidelines in mind.

In Japanese cities, space is at a premium. So convenience stores that cram everything from Kleenex to rice balls into a few square yards are everywhere. You can't walk five minutes in most cities without running into one or two or even half a dozen.

But they're not just a place for Slurpees and snacks. Nearly 27 percent of Japan's population is now 65 or older, and convenience stores are changing to serve this growing market.

Case in point is a Lawson convenience store in the city of Kawaguchi, north of Tokyo. It sells products that an American consumer would never find tucked between the aspirin and the candy bars. For example, there's a whole rack of ready-to-heat meals in colorful pouches. They're rated at levels from 1 to 5, based on how hard it is to chew what's inside.

Or, as the store's manager, Masahiko Terada, puts it, ""the higher the level, the less need for you to chew. In the end it's porridge.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ina Jaffe/NPR Ina Jaffe/NPR

Of course, not all older people have trouble chewing, and many still cook for themselves. So Terada points out a fresh food section unlike anything you'd see in most U.S. mini-marts. There are packages of raw vegetables and meat, much of it already cut up and packaged in single-serving amounts for the increasing number of older people living alone these days in Japan.

There are also dozens of products intended not so much for older consumers as for their caregivers — items to deal with incontinence and its consequences, for example, like especially strong, deodorizing laundry detergent or devices that are useful for giving bed baths.

""So, basically, we have this lineup of products so that the elderly don't need to go to the big supermarkets,"" says Terada. ""They can use this store as a substitute.""

Because older adults make up nearly 27 percent of Japan's population, they are a market that can't be ignored, says Ming Li, who works in communications for Lawson.

""We try to accommodate the changes in society,"" he says.

The convenience store industry in Japan is dominated by three major chains. Lawson is second largest. The leader is 7-Eleven, which is now owned by a Japanese company. Li says the industry is highly competitive.

""We're like, OK, if one chain is doing something, then we'll do it, too,"" says Li.

In fact, other chains are also experimenting with services that might appeal to older consumers, such as home delivery of meals or being located alongside pharmacies.

This Lawson store in Kawaguchi is one of six in a special line called Care Lawson. The company plans to expand to 30 by early next year. And these Care Lawson stores have another special feature: staff like Mika Kojima.

She's a nursing care manager and she's stationed at this Lawson store. In fact the franchise owner of this store is actually a nursing services company. Anyone who comes in can ask for Kojima's help. For example, she'll go to an older client's home to make sure it's set up so they can live there safely. And she'll connect families with adult day care services.

Whatever the request, she says, ""I make sure that I'm always prepared to listen with a smile on my face.""

Kojima's tiny office is next to a cafe area meant to give older people a place to hang out and drink tea or watch television. This is where she sees most of her clients.

""People in the neighborhood come in for tea and they start talking to me,"" Kojima says. ""And they come in four or five times a week.""

So, most of the time, Kojima deals in tea and sympathy — one of the oldest therapies in the world. And it's coming soon to a growing number of convenience stores in Japan."

NPR Applicant Experience Pledge

So, you're thinking about applying for a job at NPR? Excellent choice! We applaud your great taste and decision-making skills. Since the application process can be shrouded at times behind generic email addresses that seem to go down a black hole, let's pull back the curtain a bit and give you a glimpse into what you can expect from NPR every step of the way, from application to interview to job offer.

Talent Wanted: Apply Here

Let's start with the basics. When positions open up, the description and applicant requirements are posted in our career portal site. Through this site you can search for openings by keyword, location and division. This is also where you will submit your application (including resume, cover letter and any additional materials) electronically. By creating a login and password you'll be able to check your application status at any time throughout the process. Pretty simple.

Application Review Process: People, Not Robots

You are human. We are human. Call us crazy, but we think that actual people make the best decisions when it comes to evaluating a resume. When reviewing your application, we don't rely on robots or keyword-matching software to select the strongest candidates. We rely on humans. Most often, this human is a member of the recruiting or HR team. Sometimes it's the hiring manager or someone who works closely with the hiring manager. In short, the people who know most about the position are reviewing each application to find the best candidates for the job.

Our goal is to review all applications within two to four weeks of submission. On average, we receive 200 applications per role, and we review them all. Sometimes it may take us a bit longer due to volume and/or unexpected circumstances, but delays beyond four weeks are an exception.

This is our effort to keep applicants informed in real-time. In addition, when the position closes, we will send you an email formally letting you know the position has been filled.

Interview and Beyond

If your application is selected to move to the next stage of the interview process, a member of the hiring team will reach out to you to conduct an introductory interview, usually over the phone.

When scheduling your phone and on-site meetings we'll be as flexible and accommodating as possible. Most of our roles require one on-site interview. Some require two. There may be rare instances when a third interview is required. That typically only happens for senior roles with a variety of stakeholders; it also means we really like you.

Just southwest of bustling Charleston, S.C., lies a lush and rural gem called Wadmalaw Island, one of the Sea Islands that dot the shoreline. This is the home of the Charleston Tea Plantation, the only commercial tea plantation in North America.

Here, 127 acres of gleaming dark green tea bushes unfold in endless rows, framed against light-green fields and silvery loops of Spanish moss that festoon the oak trees. With its sandy soils, subtropical climate and generous yearly rainfall of about 50 inches, Wadmalaw is an ideal home for tea.

Rather than planting tea seeds, the Charleston Tea Plantation grows cuttings in a nursery for four years. The fledgling bushes are descendants of the same Camellia sinensis plants that were first brought to the Carolinas in the 1700s by French botanist Andre Michaux.

The plantation is owned by the Bigelow Tea Co., in partnership with third-generation tea taster William Barclay Hall, a fellow with a magnificent passion for tea and the knowledge to match it.

I spoke with Hall about the tea business while sipping a cool cuppa and gazing out at the glimmering rows of tea plants flowing like green scarves to the horizon.

Your grandfather and father were professional tea tasters. How did you become one, too?

My father suggested I go into tea. Back then you had to have family connections to be trained. London was the center of the world trade in tea at the time, and every week teas were sent to London to be auctioned off. I tasted as many as 800 teas a day, five days a week. The goal was to be able to blind taste 10 teas and identify each one's country and region of origin, and even the tea plant used.

Were those many hundreds of cups of teas simply laid out for tasting?

About 80 were laid out at a time, on long benches. You would taste them all along with a buyer, then everything would be cleaned up and 80 more teas would be laid out.

Though there is only one tea plant, Camellia sinensis, there are thousands of varieties. But they don't have names like Golden Delicious or Granny Smith — they have numbers. Believe it or not, all of the teas become individual to you. We have a special terminology for tea that ... is hard to convey to an outsider. We might say, ""This tea has good character."" Well, what does character taste like? Or ""This tea is out of condition, that one is bright, that one is brisk, and this one is burnt.""

Those descriptors are very important, because tea is one of the few commodities in the world bought and sold strictly on taste. And what makes teas so interesting, as opposed to, say, grapes, is that tea is harvested every 15-18 days. Grapes are harvested once a year — and you either have a good, bad or indifferent year. But tea is changing all the time. Is it too hot or cold this month? Is it the beginning, middle or end of the season? Did we have too much rain? All this influences the flavor of the tea.

Tell us a little about how you grow the teas here.

We don't use any pesticide, herbicides or fungicides. Tea is naturally pest resistant, because the caffeine and tannins repel insects. We use a custom irrigation system. We plant the bushes in long rows, very close together, with just enough space between the rows for the mechanical harvester to fit. That way, very little light filters down between the rows, and very few weeds or random tea seeds sprout. We dry the leaves on ""withering box"" screens for 18 hours, then macerate them in a grinder. I then steep and taste and blend each batch until it tastes just right.

You live on the property full time. How do you like it?

What could be better than a life centered around tea? Nothing, absolutely nothing. People all over the world start and end their days with tea. It's hardy, lives hundreds of years, requires no tilling of the soil and you can plant 5,200 oxygen-producing plants in every acre. It's healthy for you. I love it here so much that I will eat everything out of my refrigerator, even down to my last jar of mayonnaise, before I leave the plantation and go to the city to shop for food. Tea is the greatest crop in the world.

Tea Tuesdays is an occasional series exploring the science, history, culture and economics of this ancient brewed beverage.

BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We are playing this week with Paula Poundstone, Adam Felber and Alonzo Bodden. And here again is your host - we're at the Chase Bank Auditorium in downtown Chicago - Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

SAGAL: In just a minute, Bill will be rooting on his favorite swimmer, Rhymin' Lochte (ph) in our Listener Limerick Challenge game. If you'd like to play, give us a call at 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924.

Right now, panel, some more questions for you from the week's news. Adam, wherever you go, people are taking selfies, ruining your trip to the museum or the beach. This week, though, someone finally fought back. A visitor trying to take a photo at SeaWorld of a dolphin was stopped when what happened?

ADAM FELBER: When another dolphin photobombed.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No.

FELBER: So somebody's at SeaWorld trying to take a...

SAGAL: They're leaning over the pool taking a picture of the dolphin with an iPad.

FELBER: Oh, the dolphin took the iPad.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: Yeah.

SAGAL: The dolphin stole the iPad.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

FELBER: Yeah.

SAGAL: Yes. Dolphins hate to be photographed. They can't do duck face 'cause they're forced to smile all the time. So this week, a dolphin jumped out of the water and grabbed the iPad out of a woman's hand and pulled it under the water, just as we've all wanted to do.

FELBER: I wonder if a dolphin would be able to use an iPad. I don't think so.

SAGAL: With its little snout?

POUNDSTONE: I'm amazed...

FELBER: I mean, it'd have to be its snout. The flippers are no good for it. It's (groaning)...

SAGAL: It wouldn't happen.

POUNDSTONE: I'm amazed that it could grab the iPad.

SAGAL: It has teeth. It has a mouth.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, I was thinking it did it with its hands.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: You know, and I have read - I have read the story. And that's exactly what I had thought until just this moment. And now it does seem like a silly idea to me.

(LAUGHTER)

ALONZO BODDEN: I think if a dolphin actually grabbed your iPad with its flippers, you have to let him keep it.

FELBER: Yeah.

SAGAL: I think that's the rule. You win that one, Flipper.

POUNDSTONE: No, because iPads are not good for people or mammals of any kind. And so I would not let him keep it. But I would insist on a vegan diet for the dolphin.

SAGAL: That'd be sad if the dolphin kept the iPad and didn't want to, like, you know, play with a ball on its nose any more, just wanted to sit around.

POUNDSTONE: Well, that's certainly what's happened to our children, isn't it?

SAGAL: Yeah.

POUNDSTONE: You can't get a kid to put a ball on its nose anymore.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Alonzo, compromise is an important part of every relationship. But according to a new study, asking your partner to do what is an almost guaranteed deal breaker?

BODDEN: Allow you to date?

SAGAL: Date other people?

(LAUGHTER)

FELBER: I think you got to give him points for that.

SAGAL: Yeah, that's true. That will probably end your relationship, certainly.

FELBER: Sound relationship advice from Alonzo Bodden.

SAGAL: Yeah, no. I mean, the idea is - they studied and they said would you be willing to do this for a relationship? Would you be willing to do that? And one of the things that almost nobody was willing to do was this.

POUNDSTONE: Go vegan.

BODDEN: Any - that would be illegal.

SAGAL: Paula is actually just about right.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, my gosh.

SAGAL: I may just have to give you the point.

BODDEN: Really, change your diet?

SAGAL: Exactly right, Alonzo.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: People will not change their diet for love. Meat Loaf once famously sang, I would do anything for love, but I won't do that. Now we know...

FELBER: Where that equals eat meatloaf.

SAGAL: Exactly right. Or in his case...

SAGAL AND FELBER: (In unison) Stop eating meatloaf.

FELBER: Yeah.

SAGAL: According to a new study from the U.K., among relationship enders, asking your partner to change their diet is right up there with asking them to change their religion. It's like, OK, fine, I will give up Jesus, but I will not give up my Hot Pockets.

(LAUGHTER)

BODDEN: I've never encountered that. I've never had that situation.

SAGAL: Really? You've never had a...

FELBER: You've never been asked to not eat something?

BODDEN: No, no. I - and I date in LA, where women, you know, don't eat at all.

FELBER: Yeah.

SAGAL: Yeah, so it's easy.

BODDEN: There was only one woman I dated who - she was vegan, and she didn't tell me. And oddly enough, our first date was at an Argentinian steakhouse.

(LAUGHTER)

BODDEN: But she just ordered a salad, and she was fine with it. It was one of those things. She was like, just because I don't eat meat doesn't mean I can't be around people who do. It's just something - it was her thing. So...

SAGAL: She didn't say, oh, slaughterhouse, how romantic.

(LAUGHTER)

BODDEN: Yeah.

SAGAL: Yeah.

POUNDSTONE: You know, Alonzo's a good looking guy. I can see people...

BODDEN: Thank you, Paula.

POUNDSTONE: I can see a vegan, you know, going out with him and just having salt and pepper.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Yeah, if that's what was there.

Paradise Lost by John Milton Paperback, 465 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

But sometimes, good doesn't win the day. Sometimes the bad guys get away with it.

And if we're going to talk about villains, let's talk about the biggest of the Big Bads, the Grand-daddy of Ghouls, the Imperator of Iniquity — Satan himself. Specifically, the version of Satan set down by John Milton in Paradise Lost.

Like a lot of kids, I first encountered Milton's Satan in high school English class. And luckily, my tenth grade English teacher Rhoda Trooboff still lives here in Washington, D.C., and is more than willing to talk Milton.

Satan doesn't just get away with it, she says, ""he brings his buddies into it. And together they form a community that sounds as they describe it, really exciting. I think that model of these really well-written villains are so compelling to the reader that they're, I hate to say it, more interesting than the good guys.""

Sure, he's been cast out of Heaven, but Satan pretty much has it made in Hell.

Milton's Satan is the ancestor of our modern antiheroes, the kinds of guys who flip the fire of damnation into a blaze of glory. But the more reading I did for this story, the more I noticed another kind of unpunished villain ... people like O'Brien, the terrifyingly calm Inner Party member in George Orwell's 1984.



""If you want a vision of the future, Winston, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever,"" O'Brien says, as he tortures protagonist Winston Smith into betraying his lover Julia.

Like death and taxes, O'Brien is inescapable. And like many successful villains, he truly believes in his cause. ""Those are the ones that tend to get away with it, because they don't get distracted,"" says fantasy author Victoria Schwab. I caught up with her at this year's San Diego Comic Con because she's kind of an expert on villains. A few years back, she set herself this challenge:

1984 by George Orwell Paperback, 328 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

""If I wrote an entire book that only had bad people, could I make you root for them as if they were the hero.""

Schwab points to villains like the nobly murderous serial killer Dexter, or the X-men's long-running antagonist — and sometimes ally — Magneto. (And yes, I know, Magneto ends up in prison a lot. But he keeps coming back).

""They have their own ethics, they have their own system, they have their own code that they're following. So even if it's not our code, the fact that they do have a code, that they're not anarchic, is something that readers and viewers find really appealing.""

And I think that's the real heart of the matter — the blackened, shriveled, eeeevil heart. Because after all, it's the readers who want to see the bad guy get his just desserts, and it's the author who dispenses the punishment.

So if you're a literary villain, here's some free advice — adopt a cause, practice your smoldering glances and your withering quips, because charming the audience is your key to getting away with it. Whatever IT happens to be."

This is not optional: Before we put “experts” in our stories, we have to know where their financial support comes from, who’s paid for their latest work and whether they’re doing any lobbying or advocating related to the issue we’re interviewing them about. It’s information that may knock them out of stories and needs to be shared if they stay in.

That all seems obvious. Why are we bringing it up now?

Well, if you haven’t read these two New York Times reports yet, do so:

This “nut graph” should concern us all:

“Think tanks, which position themselves as ‘universities without students,’ have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests.”

That’s troubling because news outlets are constantly interviewing “experts” from those think tanks. Many of those experts are getting into stories without any references to their connections to “moneyed interests” and lobbying groups. We aren’t perfect on that score. I suspect it’s because in some cases we didn’t do enough digging.

This is important: Just as we said that we have to ask experts about any connections they have to candidates, we have to be looking at the connections experts from think tanks, universities and other institutions might have to interest groups and others.

That means, as we said above, asking questions such as:

- Who’s funding your work? - Who or what organization has supported you in the past? - Who paid for the study? - Is your organization (or school or think tank) taking any money from a corporation or organization with an interest in the issue? - Are you lobbying or advocating on this issue?

If someone won’t answer such questions, that’s a red flag.

Answers need to be checked, of course. Look in archives. Consult databases. Read a think tank’s annual report and other disclosure forms to see where it’s been getting its money. The RAD team can help.

We should use tools such as the U.S. Senate Lobbying Disclosure Act Database to find out if an expert is also a registered lobbyist.

This is also critical. We have to keep expanding our contact lists to get away from the usual think tanks and sources. Have you consulted the Source of the Week lately or contributed to it? Please do.

Finding out that a study was paid for by a corporation with an interest in the issue will raise questions about the findings. Learning that a think tank “fellow” is also a paid lobbyist may mean that person doesn’t make it into a story. Whatever the result, it’s basic information that we we’re expected to know and share with our audience.

Finally, there’s this: If an expert’s potential conflict of interest should have been revealed in a story, but wasn’t, that is an error that needs to be acknowledged and corrected.

Also, please continue to be careful about descriptions of the weapons. To many in the audience, “assault rifles” are fully automatic weapons that cannot be legally purchased. At this point, it’s better to refer to the rifles used in San Bernardino as “assault-style.”

But again, thanks. We’ve gotten many messages such as this one posted on Facebook:

“Thank you for reporting only the facts while others in the media build a frenzy just to be the first with ‘new information’, credible or not.”

From October: “Take Care When Describing Weapons.”

All the news we couldn't fit anywhere else.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Now onto our final game, Lightning Fill in the Blank. Each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as he or she can, each correct answer now worth two points. Bill, can you give us the scores?

BILL KURTIS: Alonzo and Paula each have two. Adam has three.

SAGAL: We have flipped a coin. Paula has elected to go second. That means, Alonzo, you're up first. The clock will start when I begin your first question. Fill in that blank. This week, the IOC banned the entire team from blank from participating in the Paralympic Games.

ALONZO BODDEN: Russia.

SAGAL: Right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: On Tuesday, a federal judge upheld the 14-year sentence of former Illinois governor blank.

BODDEN: Oh, what was that guy's name?

BODDEN: It was something like Balagovich (ph) or...

SAGAL: That's good enough. Blagojevich.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: This week, a train in Iowa derailed and crashed into blank.

BODDEN: In Iowa? It'd have to be corn, wouldn't it?

SAGAL: No, it - the train derailed and crashed into a bar called Derailed. Following - they were asking for it. Following a computer error, blank was forced to cancel over 2,000 flights across the country.

BODDEN: Child?

SAGAL: No, as a hamburger.

(LAUGHTER)

ADAM FELBER: I think that's pretty clever.

SAGAL: According to the official report, customs officials knew that something was up when they x-rayed the man's KFC bag and noticed some odd protrusion sticking out of his hamburger. When they asked to inspect his luggage, the man said, and this is what he actually said, it is a quote, ""there's no turtle in there, just a hamburger. There's nothing special to see inside.""

FELBER: Wow.

SAGAL: Well, the man...

FELBER: I think the execution might not have been as good as the plan.

SAGAL: It's true. Bill, how did how did Alonzo do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, Alonzo got four right, eight more points, 10 total, and he's in the lead.

SAGAL: All right, Paula, you are up next.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: A Wisconsin man who posted a Craigslist ad searching for his lost prosthetic leg had his prayers answered after it was recovered from blank.

POUNDSTONE: The water in Brazil.

SAGAL: No, from a beaver dam.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: According to the ad, Mark Warner lost his prosthetic limb when his boat tipped over during a fishing trip. He was sure it was gone for good. But several weeks later, two canoers called to say they had found the leg three miles away, sticking out of a beaver dam. Mark and his...

FELBER: Beavers are like sharks. They don't want to work that hard if they don't have to.

(LAUGHTER)

FELBER: They see the boat go by. They're like let's tip that thing and take the leg.

SAGAL: So it was great. So Mark got his leg back. The canoers got a reward. It was great for everybody but the beaver who was caught in a lie when he told his friends he'd ripped a guy's leg off to build his dam.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Paula do on our quiz?

KURTIS: She got five right. That means she has 10 more points, and she has the lead with 12.

SAGAL: All right.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, lordy (ph).

SAGAL: So how many, then, does Adam need to win?

KURTIS: Adam needs five to win.

SAGAL: On Sunday, a man named Enzo Lefort made the news when he dropped his cellphone while blanking.

FELBER: Swimming the 400-meter backstroke.

SAGAL: You're so close. He was actually fencing in the Rio Olympics.

FELBER: Oh.

POUNDSTONE: Wow.

SAGAL: Yeah. He was halfway through a fencing match on Sunday when he tried to avoid an attack. He caused his cellphone to fall out of the pocket of his uniform and skitter away. It was just like when you accidentally drop your phone into the toilet, except this is the floor of the Rio Olympics, so it's much more disgusting.

(LAUGHTER)

BODDEN: What call...

SAGAL: Yeah, I know.

BODDEN: What call is that important that you're fencing for a gold medal and you're like, I better keep my phone with me?

SAGAL: Yeah, I know. It's like, oh, excuse me, I got call. Hello? Yeah, no, nothing, just (imitating sound of fencing).

FELBER: You know, Alonzo, I got to say, these are fencers. It was probably for a job interview.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, did Adam do well enough to win?

KURTIS: He got five right. He needed five, 10 more points, 13 and the winner this week.

SAGAL: Congratulations.

POUNDSTONE: Yeah.

FELBER: Thank you.

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels — Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire — set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board — which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space — people with such different histories and experiences — all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored — how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world — that all cultures converge here — that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can — with little or no money — which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys — they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life' — and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about — how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great car tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation — whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation."

About the time the couple was to walk down the aisle, tornado sirens began to sound. Unfazed, the couple went on with the wedding. The tornado touched down just 3 miles from the church.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. A couple in Michigan were set to walk down the aisle over the weekend when sirens sounded, alerting the city to a tornado. Unfazed, the couple went on with the wedding. As the groom told the Grand Rapids Press, the church seemed so sturdy.

And just after the couple said, I do, tornado sirens replaced the peal of wedding bells. And guests huddled away from stained glass windows. The tornado was close, touching down just 3 miles away. It's MORNING EDITION.

If you want a peek into the history of drugstores, there's the History of Pharmacy Museum at the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, in Tucson, Ariz.

A hand-carved wood prescription counter helps recreate the look of a small-town pharmacy in the 1800s. And some of the old-timey medicines give you a sense of what the place must have smelled like.

Enlarge this image toggle caption History of Pharmacy Museum History of Pharmacy Museum

""There's a compound called asafoetida. The common name is 'devil's dung.' It has a terrible smell,"" says museum curator Richard Wiedhopf. ""People would hang it around their neck to prevent contagious disease because, hey, you didn't want be around somebody who smelled like that.""

But the centerpiece of the museum is a penny candy jar of filled with old wads of gum said to have been chewed by the infamous gangster, John Dillinger. In the 1930s, Dillinger ate at a pharmacy with a lunch counter in downtown Tucson.

""And when he was served, he took the gum out of his mouth and stuck it under the counter,"" Wiedhopf says. ""About a day or two later the headline in the Tucson paper was 'John Dillinger Arrested.' And so this pharmacist scraped all the gum off under counter where Dillinger was sitting, put it in a jar and we have that on display in the museum.""

Wiedhopf says there's no way of knowing if the museum's specimens were really chewed by Dillinger. But that's their story and like the gum under the table, they're sticking to it.

There have been a couple times this week when corrections were added to Web pages without input from the correspondents or bloggers who committed the alleged infractions. In one case, we had to correct our correction because the blogger was right the first time. (On the plus side, at least we were recognized as having posted the “Holy Grail” of corrections. )

We’ve written before about our corrections process.

Other reference materials:

– A “How We Make Corrections“ memo.

– A document called “A Common Corrections Scenario.”

This note is a reminder that when we think an error has been made, the people who did the work need to be notified immediately so that they can help determine if it really was a mistake. Here’s a key step in our process:

“If you suspect an error, talk and/or send a message to the reporter/blogger/correspondent who was responsible, and the desk editor/producer or show editor/producer who handled the piece, 2-way or Web text. This is important: Include a link to the story and details about what show or blog is involved. This is also important: Make sure you cc Mark Memmott, the DMEs, Susan Vavrick and Corrections@npr.org.”

Obviously, if it’s a glaringly obvious and serious error, we need to get the digital text fixed as soon as possible and may not be able to wait for input from those who worked on the story. But they should still be notified immediately. Also, those who are on the receiving end of a message about a possible error need to respond as soon as possible.

Hey Hugh.

It's us, the sideburns you wore while you played the character Wolverine. All the times you played Wolverine. To refresh your memory: When Wolverine 3 comes out next year, we'll have been together, the three of us, for nine movies over the course of 17 years.

Seventeen years, Hugh. Do you know what anniversary that is? It's the furniture anniversary. We were gonna make you a footstool!

But then you went on Twitter on Monday, after you finished shooting Wolverine 3, and shaved us off. Just like that. Just ritually murdered us for the amusement of your 6.74 million followers.

So we imagine you're surprised to hear from us.

But you can't kill us, Hugh. Not really. We mutton chops — we're more than the follicles that make us up; we're a way of life. An attitude. An emotional state. We are eternal.

And we're here to tell you: We refuse to accept this. You owe us.

Oh sure, you were a working actor before we met. Your Curly in Oklahoma on the West End? Very impressive. We'll note here: Your character's name was Curly. Your hairstyle was essential to the character; it carried that performance.

Huh. How about that.

Life patterns start early, I guess.

But then in 2000 you got the part of Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men, replacing Dougray Scott, the man whose two names are three names.

Let's face it; casting you was a stretch. Wolverine, in the comics, is 5 feet, 3 inches. You're a full foot taller. He's Canadian; you're Australian. And yeah, you bulked up for the part, but the Wolverine of the comics is a compact ball o' muscle, and you, Hugh, even at your most burly, retain a certain stubborn ranginess.

So. Go ahead, tell yourself it was your performance that sold audiences on your Wolverine. But we know the truth. It was us. It was always us.

That's because, qua coiffures, mutton chops signify something very specific: chaos and control in perfect balance. Facial hair allowed to grow thick and bushy — pure untrammeled virility! — but only within rigid parameters. The cheeks, not the chin.

Business in the front, party on the sides.

Historically, we are worn by men who channel their aggression into prescribed outlets — military men like Gen. Ambrose Burnside, and, um, Colonel Mustard.

Wolverine is a character trained to be a weapon — a superhero whose superpower is the disemboweling of others. To be a hero, and to live among them, he must mediate his propensity for violence, he must keep his blood lust throttled.

And all of that back story? Is sitting on his cheekbones.

Yeah. You're welcome.

You sure seem glad to be rid of us. You tell everyone who'll listen how much your wife always hated us, which we'll be honest: hurtful.

But that's fine, because we're not going anywhere, Hugh. We'll always be here, just underneath the surface of your skin.

Waiting.

And we're not alone. That ridiculous bushy hobo number you sported as Jean Valjean in Les Miserables is here with us, too. And that wildly unfortunate Van Dyke from your turn as Blackbeard in Pan.

So on nights when you're drifting off to sleep, your beloved, us-hating wife in your arms, you may catch, just at the edge of hearing, our united voices raised in defiance.

We're here.

We're beard.

Get used to it.

That's ... that's what we've come up with for now, but we're ... I mean we're still workshopping it, obviously."

Here’s a word that a search indicates may never have been said on NPR: “pleonasm.”

But we and other news outlets put pleonasms on the air and on the Web every day.

What is a pleonasm?

“The use of more words than are necessary for the expression of an idea; redundancy.”

Some examples:

– There’s been a “mass exodus” of Syrians.

An “exodus” is the departure of a large, massive group.

– “What I did was legally permitted, first and foremost,” says Hillary Clinton.

“Foremost” means “first in place or time.”

– Homes that were in the path of a wildfire were “completely destroyed.”

If they were destroyed, enough’s been said.

John McIntyre, the “veteran drudge” at the Baltimore Sun, has collected pleonasms, here and here.

A few of the more common:

– “Safe haven.”

– “Final results.”

– “Advance planning.”

You can probably think of many more.

There are times when pleonasms are useful – for instance, when you want to make sure listeners really, really, really understand the point you’re making. Also, they are common expressions and we do try to be conversational.

But, they annoy some listeners, might add nothing to your story and take up space when you may be fighting to squeeze in valuable information. Feel free to cut them.

Rio 2016 organizers dropped the curtain on the Summer Games on Sunday after hosting the world's elite athletes who've competed for 306 medals over the past 19 days here in Rio de Janeiro.

The closing ceremony starts at 8 p.m. local time, which is one hour ahead of Eastern Time. Because of NBC's time delay, it's airing at 8 p.m. ET and progressively later across the U.S.

We're updating this post with scenes from the event, so please refresh to see what's happening in Rio. We got a late start due to technical issues, so we're filling in some blanks from the official guide to the ceremony.

The opening ceremony began with a countdown, similar to the one we saw in the opening ceremony. After that, performers evoked the colors we've seen all during these games — inflections on Brazil's blue, green and yellow flag — to form a welcoming array of Rio landmarks.

Later in the show, a segment evoked the expanse of time that the opening show also got at, with cave-paintings displayed on Maracana Stadium's floor in a meditation on archaeology.

The effect was very pretty — but the crowd loved what came in the show's second half. In one segment, cartoon characters such as Mario ran around — and then, inexplicably and yet wondrously, shot a drill bit through the Earth and out the other side. They created a tunnel that links Tokyo (hosts of the 2020 Games) and Rio, with a green pipe-like entrance protruding from Rio.

And here in Rio, the tunnel's green entrance then magically appeared on the floor of Maracana — and out popped Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Or at least that's what we're told. It's one of those ""Wait, what... I love it!"" moments that Olympic ceremonies pull off at their best.

Another winning segment came earlier, when Grupo Corpo, a contemporary dance troupe from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, put on part of ""Parabelo,"" one of its shows, at the ceremony. But then the dancers gave way to ""clay people,"" and the performance drew roars of approval as the crowd bopped along to Luiz Gonzaga's forró song ""Asa Branca.""

The closing ceremonies must always include speeches, and that happened often. There were also national anthems — of Brazil, of Greece, of Japan and of Kenya (during a medal ceremony for marathon).

At the end of the show came a tribute to a personal favorite of ours: the genius landscape designer and artist Roberto Burle Marx, famous for his organic, wavy shapes (he created Copacabana's iconic sidewalk tile pattern). Trained in Europe, Marx was a champion of Brazil's native plants and its rain forests. In this segment, the music is ""Chovendo na Roseira,"" in a version by Tom Jobim.

The flame was then extinguished, in a graceful official end to these games.

And then, after a thoughtful pause — and because Rio knows how to party — the drums kicked in, and six samba singers belted out ""Cidade Maravilhosa"" (Marvelous City) — a Carnival march that is Rio's anthem. In the stadium, row upon row of people stood and danced, singing along.

Was it then over? Not yet: A sound truck appeared, along with 12 carnival queens, and athletes who competed in these games poured out.

While these games have been criticized for not having full seats, Maracana was packed last night with people who watched Brazil's men's soccer team win gold. And tonight, it's full of people who came out to enjoy the unique spectacle the Olympics brings.

Music — seen by many as the backbone of Brazil's culture — is woven throughout this ceremony, from old classics and traditional music to new pop sounds from around the country. The audience clearly agrees with the choices the show's music programmers have made. Brazilian music has many anthems, standards that everyone can sing, and tonight we're hearing strains of familiar music reworked in new ways.

At the start of the show, a choir of 27 children entered, looking like little twinkling stars. With singers representing Brazil's 26 states (and the Federal District), they performed Brazil's national anthem.

We'll note that after a travel delay, we arrived at Maracana Stadium later than we wanted — it's a rainy, dreary evening in Rio. But the show must go on — even in an open-air stadium. Tonight, Maracana's halls are darkened to highlight the light show and the Olympic flame.

At the end of an Olympics, talk always turns to their legacy — and instead of one, these games could be said to have many: First and foremost, there's the drama, grace and excellence displayed by more than 11,000 athletes.

Then there are the games' effects on Rio — its people, its infrastructure and its standing. What will become of the buildings erected to host this global event? And will the Paralympic Games, which have faced huge budget problems here in Rio, go smoothly?

The impact of the Olympics on the city's future is tied to its impact on Brazil, whose economy was bustling when Rio won the right to host these games eight years ago but which was continually forced to rebalance its budget for the Olympics and Paralympics, making cuts that sometimes gave a ramshackle air to the proceedings.

And then, we come to the members of the U.S. swim team who failed to distinguish themselves repeatedly in an episode that eventually led U.S. Olympic Committee President Scott Blackmun to apologize ""to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal."""

Not Many Do, Research Shows

During an experiment, people consented to sharing their private information with the NSA, and to surrendering their first-born as payment for access to a fictitious social networking site.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And you probably know this. Every time you sign up for something online - maybe you're updating your operating system on your mobile device, maybe you're buying a new app, maybe you're just getting a new loyalty card from the drugstore - you're often presented with this lengthy legal statement, and you're asked if you agree with the terms of service. Well, there is new social science research that looks into what all of us do when we encounter these documents. And to explain, we're joined by - who else? - NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. Hey, Shankar.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, David.

GREENE: I mean to tell you something - I never even read those policies. I click I agree, and I'm scared that you're going to tell me that I'm making a mistake.

VEDANTAM: You are making a mistake, but you're not the exception of it.

GREENE: Good.

VEDANTAM: You are the rule.

GREENE: Good. I feel better.

VEDANTAM: You know, as soon as one of those lengthy legal policy things come up, I immediately start hunting for the button that says agree...

GREENE: Yeah.

VEDANTAM: To say I agree with what - to whatever terms...

GREENE: Sometimes they make you actually scroll as if you're reading it before you can agree...

VEDANTAM: (Laughter).

GREENE: ...But that's - that helps.

VEDANTAM: Exactly. I was speaking with Jonathan Obar. He studies information policy at York University. He's conducted some new work showing how bad the problem is, but this piggybacks on some earlier work. Here's Obar.

JONATHAN OBAR: It would take the average user 40 minutes a day to read all of - and that's every day - to read all of the privacy and terms of service policies that we encounter related to the different services that we're using all the time.

GREENE: Oh, yeah, the spare 40 minutes we have in all of our days to do that. I mean, that's crazy.

VEDANTAM: It is crazy. But we all participate in this collective act of fiction, David. Companies get to say that they are telling us what they're going to do with our data, and we say we've understood the terms and are providing informed consent. Obar and his colleague Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch at the University of Connecticut decided they wanted to put empirical heft to something we all know is happening.

So they conducted a study where they asked volunteers to sign up for a new social networking site called Name Drop as in drop that name, get that job.

GREENE: They just made this thing up.

VEDANTAM: Yes.

GREENE: They came up with it.

VEDANTAM: Yeah.

GREENE: OK.

VEDANTAM: Now, the social networking site was fictitious, but the research has created a legal agreement laying out the terms of service. It would have taken volunteers a lot of time to read. Buried in the agreement was the disclosure that anything users shared would be passed along to the NSA.

GREENE: (Laughter) The National Security Agency.

VEDANTAM: Exactly.

GREENE: The top secret government agency that many people are already afraid are gathering too much information about us. That's great.

VEDANTAM: Precisely. Obar told me that exactly one volunteer - one out of more than 500 raised a concern...

GREENE: Oh, my God.

VEDANTAM: ...About information being passed along to the NSA. He also included another really unusual clause in the agreement.

OBAR: What we did is we went to the extreme, and we included this - a firstborn clause suggesting that if you agreed to these policies that as a form of payment, you'd be giving up a first-born child. And 98 percent of the participants that took the study didn't even notice this particular clause.

VEDANTAM: So I think there's a couple of interesting things happening here psychologically, David. People don't anticipate all the ways that information collected about them can reveal things about them and how it can be used. So people are signing these agreements without reading them because they say I have nothing to hide, but, as Obar says, maybe your grocery store is selling information about your food purchases to your insurance company, which then uses it to make judgments about your health risk.

And, of course, from the point of view of companies and policy-makers, the idea that these documents are eliciting informed consent is really a joke. They may provide legal cover, but how many people are really providing informed consent when they're willing to give up their first-born child just to use a social networking site?

GREENE: Thanks, Shankar.

VEDANTAM: Thanks, David.

GREENE: That is NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. He is also the host of a podcast that explores the unseen patterns in human behavior. It is called Hidden Brain.

A check of our archives shows we’ve generally avoided the phrase “officer-involved shooting.” Thanks.

But it has crept into some DACS-only pages, online teasers, photo captions and headlines. Going forward, let’s not use it.

As On The Media explored this week, “officer-involved shooting” is among those phrases that feel like “euphemisms designed by government to change the subject.”

The better way to go is almost always to simply say “police shooting” or to use action words – basically, to describe what happened rather than try to label it.

Videos and audio clips of someone being shot, a disaster victim crying for help, bodies being recovered and other potentially disturbing scenes present us with challenges.

When weighing whether to post such videos online and to use any clips on the air, keep in mind that:

– Conversations are required. The senior news manager on duty (a DME or the designated supervisor) must be consulted. The Visuals team should be pulled in. Other senior editors may be as well.

– The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

– But we can’t be callous. The video may show someone’s death. Out of respect for that person and that person’s family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someone’s moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

– We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

– “Every other news outlet else is using it” is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

– Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

– The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do won’t work. Each situation is different. However:

– If it’s decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a “click” to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

– Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that it’s coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

– We should consider whether a video’s disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

– If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlet’s edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: ”The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.”

– When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, we’ll be in agreement and can link to the station’s coverage.

But, But, But:

– Does this mean we’ll never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: “We report the news, good and bad.” We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

– Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe we’re making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

Grave's District Under Water

Almost two weeks after severe flooding in Louisiana, President Obama will visit the state. David Greene talks to Republican Rep. Garret Graves about how his district is doing.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

When President Obama touches down in Baton Rouge, La, later today, it will have been 11 days since the flooding began in that state. Obama has critics who say he should've cut his vacation short and gotten there earlier. Louisiana's Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards is not one of them. Here he is on MSNBC last week.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN BEL EDWARDS: In all honesty, if he's going to visit, I would just as soon it be a week or 10 days, 14 days from now. We have to take hundreds of local first responders, police officers, sheriff's deputies and state troopers to provide security for that type of visit. I would just as soon have those people engaged in the response rather than trying to secure the president.

GREENE: Now, one person trying to become president, Donald Trump, visited late last week. That also brought its share of security and logistical wrangling. Neither Trump nor Obama are as familiar with this part of the country as Congressman Garret Graves. The Republican represents Louisiana's 6th District, much of which remains underwater this morning. He's on the line from his home in Baton Rouge.

Congressman, we've been thinking of everyone in your state. And thanks for taking the time in what I know has been an awful stretch for you.

GARRET GRAVES: No, I appreciate you all doing this and bringing more attention to what's going on here.

GREENE: Do you feel like you haven't gotten enough attention, as much as you should be getting?

GRAVES: I do. And I know this isn't a hurricane where you have days that lead up to this disaster. But it's really amazing. The devastation is profound and just goes for tens and tens of miles in every direction. It's a pretty incredible disaster.

GREENE: What does it look like, as you look at those miles and miles?

GRAVES: You can literally get into a car, and I could take you on a ride for probably 30 or 40 miles. And all you would see is 10-foot piles of debris in front of every single home and business in our community.

GREENE: So what are you telling constituents as they deal with just devastation like that?

GRAVES: David, I'll tell you. I don't think I've cried since I was a kid. And the number of times that I've embraced people with tears in my eyes over the past several days is - it's just amazing - you know, people standing there saying, I just lost both of my cars. I lost my home. I lost all my clothes. I lost my appliances. I lost all my family heirlooms and pictures. What do I do?

And I got to tell you, it's really difficult giving them a good answer because the traditional response to a disaster like this simply doesn't address even the fundamental needs that many people in this community have right now.

GREENE: You say traditional response. I mean, there is some aid money that's automatically - comes through. But a lot of people are saying the federal government needs to do a lot more. And I just wonder, I mean, it's - you know, it's Republicans, your party, who are often very wary of federal spending in times of disasters and other times. What are you telling your fellow Republicans right now?

GRAVES: Look, you're right. And I want to be clear. I'm a fiscal conservative as well. However, in this situation, when FEMA comes in and offers folks - I think I've been told - on average, two to $3,000 for a situation like this - let me be clear. You have traditional disasters. And I've been through oil spill, flooding, hurricanes. I've worked all those.

This is just very different in that this - we had 31 inches of rain in some of these areas. That is the annual average national rainfall, meaning that's the average rainfall in a year's time for the United States. And we got it in just a couple days.

GREENE: I know, it's just a stunning number. Well, can I ask you - I mean, if we look back a few years to Superstorm Sandy, there were members of Congress in the Northeast who were begging for federal funding. And I know you were not in Congress at that point, but there were members of the Louisiana delegation who joined others in stopping that federal aid. Does that give you a credibility problem now, as Louisiana's really asking for help?

GRAVES: You know, look, I don't want to pretend to understand everything that was in the Sandy package to know that if it was overly funded or not - if it was overfunded or not. But I will tell you that whenever someone has a tragedy like this, like Hurricane Sandy, I do think that Congress has an obligation to step in to tailor the response to that disaster. And, you know, again, it's easy for me to sit here and say - give you an answer right now. But I do think I would've supported that based upon my understanding of the impacts in that area.

GREENE: Does this - does seeing this in your home state make you a little less of a fiscal conservative?

GRAVES: I don't think so because I actually look at it like this. If someone is upside down on their mortgage, if someone doesn't have cars, if their job is underwater, these people are likely on a trajectory to become a federal responsibility through different poverty programs. And I look at it like the most fiscally appropriate thing to do is to help them get back on their feet right now, to avoid them becoming a long-term liability under many of these programs.

GREENE: And, Congressman, we just have a few seconds left. I just wonder, what is your take on when presidents and presidential candidates come to visit? Is it a distraction?

GRAVES: You know, number one, I think when Trump came it certainly brought national attention. And in a case like this, I don't think that people in Washington can really understand what is going on down here and really help us tailor a recovery package without seeing it firsthand. It really is profound...

GREENE: OK, Congressman, sadly, we're out of time. We'll be thinking of the people of Louisiana. Congressman Garret Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, sir.

GRAVES: Thanks, David.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Rory Staunton Foundation Courtesy of Rory Staunton Foundation

After Rory Staunton fell at the gym and cut his arm in March of 2012, the 12-year-old became feverish. He vomited during the night and complained of a sharp pain in his leg. When his parents called his pediatrician the next day, she said there was a stomach virus going around New York City, and his leg pain was likely due to his fall.

But she did advise his parents, Orlaith and Ciaran Staunton, to take Rory to the emergency department because of possible dehydration. The hospital workers did some blood work, gave him fluids and sent him home.

The next day, Rory's pain and fever were worse. His skin was mottled and the tip of his nose had turned blue. The Stauntons raced back to the hospital, where he was admitted to intensive care. The diagnosis: septic shock. Rory was fighting an infection that was turning his skin black and shutting down his organs.

On Sunday, four days after he dove for the ball in gym class, Rory died.

Sepsis, which is a body's overwhelming response to infection, kills more than 250,000 people in the U.S. every year. People at highest risk are those with weakened immune systems, the very young and elderly, and patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer or kidney disease. It is also risky for people with pneumonia or those who use catheters that can cause infections. But it can strike anyone, even a healthy child like Rory.

Sepsis typically occurs when germs from an infection get into the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. To fight the infection, the body mounts an immune response that may trigger inflammation that damages tissues and interferes with blood flow. That can lead to a drop in blood pressure, potentially causing organ failure and death.

""It was frightening to think that something could kill my son so fast and it would be something that I had never heard of,"" said Orlaith Staunton.

She's not alone. Many people don't know about sepsis. Health care providers struggle to identify it early, but there's no simple diagnostic test. Many symptoms — elevated heart and respiratory rates, fever or chills, pain — are common ones that are present in many conditions.

A growing number of doctors, hospitals, patient advocates and policymakers are pushing to educate consumers and clinicians about sepsis. The goal is to ensure that procedures that focus on prevention and early detection are followed.

The Stauntons established a foundation to raise awareness about the deadly infection, and in 2013 New York became the first state to require all hospitals to implement procedures for early recognition and treatment. This month, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a law requiring similar actions by hospitals in that state.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study Tuesday about sepsis as part of an effort to draw attention to the importance of prevention and early detection.

""Early treatment is vital,"" says Dr. Anthony Fiore, chief of the epidemiology research and innovations branch at the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. ""It's an emergency that you need to deal with, like heart attack and stroke.""

When sepsis advances to septic shock, characterized by severely low blood pressure, each hour of delay in administering antibiotics decreases the odds of survival by an average 7.6 percent, one study found.

In 2013, sepsis (sometimes called septicemia) accounted for nearly $24 billion in hospital costs, the most expensive condition treated. Up to half of people who get it die. Many cases are related to health care, such as catheter use or an infection acquired in the hospital. But contrary to the common perception, approximately 80 percent of cases develop outside the hospital or at a nursing home, according to the CDC.

As the front line in identifying these cases, emergency departments typically have sepsis protocols in place to screen for it.

""The work you do in those first three to six hours in the emergency department makes more difference in cost than the whole next several weeks in the ICU,"" said Dr. Todd L. Slesinger, who co-chairs a task force on sepsis at the American College of Emergency Physicians, which has developed a tool to help emergency department staff screen and treat the condition.

Last fall, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services started requiring hospitals to measure and report on screening and treatment efforts. In addition, Medicare sets penalties for a variety of hospital-acquired conditions, including high rates of post-operative sepsis.

Patient advocates and policymakers agree that patients themselves are key to improving prevention and early detection. Good hygiene can help prevent sepsis, including cleaning wounds. If someone gets injured, look for signs of sepsis, including rapid breathing or heart rate, confusion, fever or chills and pale or discolored skin.

Don't assume health care providers have it covered, experts advise. If you or someone you're caring for has these symptoms, ask the health care provider directly: ""Do you think it might be sepsis?""

Because some words and phrases come up often, because there are new folks on most desks and shows, because some people have shifted jobs in recent months and because many of us have lousy memories, a reminder is in order.

We have guidance on a wide variety of words and phrases that need to be handled carefully. The guidance should be used.

For instance:

– Do we say “abortion clinics?” No. We refer to “clinics that perform abortions.” Read more.

– “Illegal immigrants?” “Undocumented immigrants?” No and no. We prefer action phrases such as “people in the country illegally.” Read more.

– “Assault rifle?” Probably not. In most cases it’s “assault-style.” Read more.

– “Migrants” or “refugees?” They aren’t interchangeable. Read more.

– “Gay marriage?” No. “Same-sex marriage” is the phrase to use. Read more.

– “Islamic terrorists?” No. The word to use is “Islamist.” Read more.

There are several places to go to find such guidance. We all should read through them occasionally to see what’s there, refresh our memories and head off annoying notes from editors. The resources include two that are open to the public:

– The Ethics Handbook.

– The “Memmos.”

More is posted on our radio and digital style guides – which remain, for now at least, inside our Intranet. It’s not that hard to get to them. They’re just a couple clicks away. Go to the Intranet, click on the little “link” icon in the top left corner and a dropdown box will appear.

Jonah Hill and Todd Phillips talk with Rachel Martin about their ""War Dogs,"" which tells the mostly-true story of two pot-smoking 20-year-olds who win a $300 million U.S. government weapons contract.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

At the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. government was awarding hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts to American companies, everything from fixing air conditioners to supplying weapons. And many of those contractors made a whole lot of money, including David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. These two 20-something pot-smoking guys from Florida figured out how to sell old Chinese ammunition to the U.S. government for $300 million.

It is a true story, first told in a 2011 piece in Rolling Stone. It's now the premise for the new film from director Todd Phillips. The film is called ""War Dogs."" And it co-stars Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as the masterminds of this racket. Jonah Hill and Todd Phillips join us now.

Hey, you two. Thanks so much for being with us.

JONAH HILL: Thanks for having us.

TODD PHILLIPS: Yeah, thank you.

MARTIN: Jonah, I'll start with you. You actually, I understand, tried to grab this story for your own creative purposes before you realized Todd had already optioned it.

HILL: Yeah, that's right. I mean, I read it and was completely blown away by what I was reading 'cause the story was so unbelievable. And that paired with a character that was so manipulative and sociopathic and charismatic at the (laughter) same time...

MARTIN: You're like that's the guy for me.

HILL: ...I said, hey, there's my guy. And then, of course, Mr. Phillips had already beaten me to the punch.

MARTIN: Todd, why'd you want to make this film?

PHILLIPS: What stuck out to me was the idea that it was true. In other words, if it had been a piece of fiction in The New Yorker, I'd be like, oh, these characters are really good. This is a cool setting, but I just don't believe it. And the fact that it was real was actually the thing that first struck out to me. And the more we kind of looked into the story on our own, it just kept feeling more and more like a movie.

MARTIN: Jonah, you intimated that this guy's character is not - I don't know, he's not a nice guy. Efraim Diveroli is the character who you play. He's a crude, self-serving serial liar. I mean, you - when you talk to actors, often they say, oh, but the bad guys are always more interesting to play. But was there something that you connected with in him, in Efraim?

HILL: Thankfully, there wasn't a lot I connected with Efraim.

MARTIN: That's a good thing.

HILL: It is a very good thing. But I'm very, very attracted to morally ambiguous characters, not just pure bad guys or pure good guys. But I think morality is so individual and personal, and people draw their own lines of what that means for them. And I like playing characters that, you know, a couple could go see the movie and one person could love him and one person could hate him.

MARTIN: Can you talk about what the gray lines were for him, then, in this story, in this plot? Where was Efraim kind of trying to make decisions, figuring out his own moral calculus?

HILL: Well, I don't think he was trying to figure out his moral calculus (laughter). I think his lines of ink are pretty thick of - already drawn. But just the idea of what he's doing, initially, is not illegal. That, to me, was the most interesting part is that he's really easy to paint as a criminal - he eventually is. But initially, he saw a loophole, and he went for it. It could have been selling oats, but it was selling guns.

MARTIN: Todd, people probably know you best as the director of ""The Hangover"" trilogy. This film has some similarities. It's raunchy and funny at times. But it's also - maybe not a political commentary - but about political things, which is different for you. Was that something you'd been interested in for a while?

PHILLIPS: It wasn't that I wanted to make a political movie, it was that I do happen to like movies about guys who make bad decisions.

MARTIN: (Laughter).

PHILLIPS: And this just seemed like one of the worst. And there is something really exciting about documenting real life. I mean, how many days or how many months have you had that are purely dramatic? And how many months have you had that are purely comedic? Real life is a mixture of those things. So I think if you do it right and if your sort of attempt is at reality, even when reality is absurd, it's going to be a balance of tones.

MARTIN: So speaking of absurd, whose idea was it to give Efraim that laugh?

PHILLIPS: (Laughter) That's all Jonah. You know, it's so interesting because actors always find different ways into their characters. You know, sometimes it's wardrobe or hair or the way the guy walks. And I remember, like, it was maybe two days before we started filming, I think, and Jonah came up to me and said, hey, I think I figured out how this guy laughs, and I want to do it for you. And I said, please and he...

MARTIN: Jonah, you don't want to give us an example, do you?

HILL: No, but I can...

MARTIN: Can you describe it?

HILL: ...Explain it to you, if you want.

MARTIN: Sure.

HILL: Yeah. I mean...

MARTIN: It's hard to describe.

HILL: Well, it's not the sound that is what's interesting about it. It's, like - basically, when I met David Packouz, he said, if you met Efraim once, you never forgot him. And I thought about people in my life I had met once or twice and I remembered forever. And a lot of times, I realized they had a really distinct laugh. So I tried to create a laugh for Efraim that was distinct but that fit him. And moreso, the way it started to be used during the scenes was in a way where he was encouraging the person talking by laughing. He was making them feel comfortable and at ease and put their guard down so he could then easily manipulate them.

MARTIN: Yeah. In the end of the film, your characters, Efraim and David, are convicted of fraud. Efraim goes to jail. David gets put on house arrest, and there's a faultline in their relationship. That's what transpired in the film. In the end, for these two men, what happened to their own personal relationship when this was all over?

PHILLIPS: Well, when we were making the film, Efraim was still in jail serving his sentence. And actually when we were editing the movie, he was in jail. He had just recently gotten out, and he lives blocks away from David, still in Miami Beach. They don't talk because David is still suing Efraim right now. I forget for the amount, but it's a pretty large amount of money that he feels is still owed to him.

MARTIN: Director Todd Phillips, speaking to us from our studios at NPR West. And Jonah Hill talked to us from the studios of the CBC in Toronto. The new film is called ""War Dogs.""

Hey, you two, thank you so much.

PHILLIPS: Thanks, Rachel.

HILL: Thank you. It was great talking to you.

NPR talks to the man who created the painting of the world's largest jigsaw puzzle, Adrian Chesterman. It has 33,600 pieces, and when completed it is more than 18 by 5 feet.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

We spotted something today on FARK. That's F-A-R-K. That's the website that collects news items that tend toward the bizarre. It's a gift idea for all your friends and loved ones who want, let's say, a cumbersome, frustrating, time-consuming present this holiday season, one that can take up an entire room.

ADRIAN CHESTERMAN: Yeah. It's massive.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

We're talking about a puzzle, a 33,600-piece jigsaw puzzle. It's 18 feet long, 5 feet wide and weighs more than 35 pounds.

CORNISH: Yikes.

SHAPIRO: The image on it is a fantasy forest with every imaginable animal. It's called ""Wilderness.""

CORNISH: ""Wilderness"" is the creation of Adrian Chesterton (sic). He's an artist living in Spain. He says he's done lots of other puzzles.

CHESTERMAN: But I've never done one this big. They're usually about a thousand-piece, 1,500 pieces. But (laughter) obviously, 33,600 is kind of an exception.

CORNISH: Chesterton (sic) says this enormous jigsaw puzzle is just the latest volley in an ever-escalating battle.

CHESTERMAN: There's a company in Germany called Ravensburger, and the company I did this for is Spanish, called Educa Borras. And Educa Borras and Ravensburger have been competing to who has the biggest jigsaw puzzle in the world for the last 10 years. So one produced one of at 8,000, and then the other produced one at 10 and then at 12. And it leapt to 16, and then it went to 18 and then 24. This is like a game of tennis. And the last one was Ravensburger - did a 25,000-pieces puzzle.

SHAPIRO: Adrian Chesterton (sic) would like his town to sponsor an event for charity and get schoolchildren to complete this monstrous puzzle. And then he wants the competition to make an ever-bigger puzzle to end.

CHESTERMAN: I mean. it's getting so silly. You'd need a house the size - I mean, you'd have to be the queen of England or - I don't know - live in a house the size of the White House.

CORNISH: That's Adrian Chesterton (sic). His artwork is featured on the world's largest jigsaw puzzle. It's called ""Wilderness."" And by the way, he hasn't assembled it himself because he's too busy. He told us the most recent jigsaw puzzle he solved had just 12 pieces. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In the audio of this story we mistakenly say the puzzle’s name is “Wilderness.” In fact, the puzzle’s name is “Wildlife.” Also, there was a mispronunciation. The artist’s name is Adrian Chesterman, not Chesterton.]

For Couric, it all started at a local radio station where she was hired as an intern by our very own Judge and Scorekeeper Emeritus Carl Kasell. Couric was, unsurprisingly, a very good intern, so we've invited her to answer three questions about very bad interns.

Katie Couric has done it all in broadcast journalism — she's hosted the Today Show and her own daytime talk show, she's anchored CBS Evening News, and has been a correspondent for 60 Minutes. Now, she's working on a brand new podcast .

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

And now the game where people who've come a long way get to glimpse for a minute what they thought they had left behind. It's called Not My Job. So Katie Couric has held every job in broadcast journalism. She started as an intern at a local radio station, then she manned the front desk at a TV station, then she became a correspondent, and then the host of ""The Today Show"" and then the evening news anchor and a daytime talk show host. And now she's hosting a brand new podcast. Yes, that last one left us a little surprised, as well. Katie Couric, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

KATIE COURIC: Thank you. Nice to be here, Peter.

SAGAL: Nice to talk to you.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So let's talk about your early career. And we're very interested in a particular chapter of it because our understanding is that one of your first jobs was an internship at a radio station in Virginia.

COURIC: Yes, it was WAVA all-news radio, and my boss in my very first internship in media was none other than Carl Kasell.

SAGAL: It's true.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: Wow.

SAGAL: He used to brag about you all the time.

COURIC: Oh, well, he was so nice. He had that Army haircut...

SAGAL: Yes.

COURIC: ...And was just the nicest person in the world. And it was really nice, as I progressed in my career, for him to say he really introduced me to broadcasting because it's true. And I think the world of him, and I hope that he'll do the voice on my answering machine, too, 'cause I'd be very excited.

SAGAL: I - from what he's told me, he'll do anything you ask.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Well, all right, but you do have to win, Katie.

COURIC: OK.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: There - in the movies about - particularly about female broadcasters - there's always that moment where they run out, and they do that story that makes their reputation. Did you have a moment like that?

COURIC: Yes, actually. I think - well, I think I got noticed when I was doing a tour of the White House with Barbara Bush. And I didn't think that President Bush was there, but suddenly I heard his cocker spaniel or springer spaniel - what was that name of that dog? I can't remember. Millie or something?

POUNDSTONE: Yeah.

SAGAL: Millie, yes. It was Millie. Millie wrote a book.

COURIC: Yeah, coming into the room, and President Bush was following him. And suddenly I had to do an interview with the president of the United States that I wasn't prepared to do. I was just getting a tour of the White House. So that was sort of where I found my career path before my eyes. But I was able to come up with enough questions to keep him there for something like 19 minutes and 20 seconds.

SAGAL: Wow.

COURIC: So that was kind of a big moment.

SAGAL: Oh, I'm sorry, something like 19 minutes and 20 seconds.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You can't quite remember, but it was in the vague neighborhood.

ADAM FELBER: It could've been 19 minutes and 19 seconds. We're not sure.

COURIC: So, you know, I had to ask him about Iran-Contra and all these things that were in the news. But I hadn't really thought about it because I wasn't prepared to do the interview. So that was sort of where the rubber met the road, and I was able to pull it off. So I think I did get some attention for that.

SAGAL: Right.

POUNDSTONE: Wow.

SAGAL: Did you - I'm guessing - you were a pioneer, of course. You were the first woman, need we say, to host the evening newscast. You must have dealt with some sexism coming up.

COURIC: Yeah, I always say that I started in television when harassed was two words instead of one.

(LAUGHTER)

FELBER: Now, that's a good one.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Did you...

COURIC: I also - Peter, I got another one. I also used to say that - gravitas - because they used to question if I had enough gravitas to do the ""CBS Evening News"" - but I used to say gravitas was Latin for testicles.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: When you when you moved to ""CBS Evening News"" to be their lead anchor, did you have to, like, go to anchor school? Or you were just doing what you did as the morning show host?

COURIC: Well, no. I had to kind of get a lobotomy because I couldn't really have a personality as much on the evening news as I was able to have on ""The Today Show"" when, you know, we're cutting up or cooking with Martha Stewart. So I had to be very, very serious.

SAGAL: How smart.

FELBER: You know, all across the country right now, anchormen and anchorwomen are looking up the word lobotomy and going - hey.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I want to talk to you about - well, I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's your most famous interview these days. And that is your famous interview in 2008 with Sarah Palin...

POUNDSTONE: Oh.

FELBER: Yes.

SAGAL: ...Where you ask that terribly unfair gotcha question of - what newspapers do you read?

(LAUGHTER)

COURIC: Oh, gosh. Yes, that was - you know, that was a big interview for that campaign. And I think we did talk about a lot of important issues, like Iran. We talked a lot about tax cuts, et cetera, et cetera. I wanted to really see how she would approach some of the most challenging issues of our time.

But then we were just doing a little B-roll, as Bill knows what that is, just kind of to cover parts of the interview. And so we were doing a little walk and talk. So I said, what newspapers and magazines do you read on a regular basis that helped establish your world view? And that's when she said, all of them. And then I - she wouldn't name any specific publications, which I was surprised about. She could have said Field and Stream, even. I don't care.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: And wasn't it true that after that, they complained about you and your aggressive, liberally biased gotcha questions about her reading habits?

COURIC: You know, I felt bad for her. She was embarrassed by that interview, so she basically said that they were gotcha questions. And, you know, I think most people, if you watch the whole interview, you can see that the questions were really quite legitimate and fair.

SAGAL: As I'm sure they will be when you interview Donald Trump.

COURIC: He won't let me.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, is that true?

SAGAL: Have you tried?

COURIC: No, I've tried.

POUNDSTONE: After the hatchet job you did on Sarah Palin, no wonder.

COURIC: Paula, you have to call - you've got to call him.

SAGAL: This is the - you mentioned this. Now, after your illustrious career doing everything there is to do in television, you're now hosting a podcast. What happened, Katie?

COURIC: (Laughter) Well, Peter, the older I got, the more I had a face for radio, I think.

SAGAL: Hey.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Some of us were born this way.

COURIC: (Laughter).

SAGAL: Katie Couric, it is a pleasure to talk to you. And we have asked you here today to play a game that this time we're calling...

BILL KURTIS: Some Copying, a Little Filing and Some Light Malfeasance.

SAGAL: So we have established you were hired way back when as an intern by our very own Carl Kasell, and he always told us you were a very good one. So we've decided to ask you three questions about bad interns. Get two right, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, Carl Kasell's voice on their voice mail saying good job, good job.

COURIC: Oh, God. OK.

SAGAL: All right. Who is Katie Couric playing for?

KURTIS: Karen Davis of Gilbert, Ariz. Happy Birthday, Karen.

SAGAL: Oh, it's her birthday. Extra pressure.

(APPLAUSE)

POUNDSTONE: (Singing) You say it's your birthday.

SAGAL: All right, Katie. You ready to do this?

COURIC: Yeah. I'm not sure how I play, but I think I'll get the hang of it.

SAGAL: All right. We'll give it a try. Here we go. So Jeffrey Garofano worked as an intern for the Colorado Senate campaign of Michael Bennett in 2010, but he was let go after he did what? A - he tried to sell meetings with the candidate for $2,400 each. B - he wore a beret and asked the candidate for a, quote, ""special hug.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Or C - told a local newspaper out there that his political hero was Che Guevara.

COURIC: OK, I'm going to say C.

SAGAL: You're going to go for C, that he told the newspaper his political hero was Che Guevara.

COURIC: Uh-huh (ph).

SAGAL: No, I'm afraid it was actually the first one.

COURIC: Oh.

SAGAL: He tried to sell meetings with the candidate for $2,400.

POUNDSTONE: What?

COURIC: OK, that was my second choice.

ALONZO BODDEN: Is that not legal?

SAGAL: Apparently, you're allowed to do that, but you're not allowed to say you're doing it or something like that.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, I was going to say, here in Illinois, that would make him governor, wouldn't it?

SAGAL: I know.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: That was just a warm-up. You just throw that one away. Doesn't matter 'cause you still have two more chances. An unidentified intern described in a column in USA Today got fired after he did what. A - started using the company's conference rooms for band practice. B - listed himself as CEO heir apparent on the company's website. Or C - installed a bed, complete with sheets, pillows and shams, in the middle of the office for his naps.

COURIC: OK, I'm going to say B.

SAGAL: You're going to say B - he listed himself as CEO heir apparent on the company's website. I just want to give you a little bit of a trivia that prior to about two days ago, I did not know what a sham was.

POUNDSTONE: I have a cat named ShamWow.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Also, Katie, Paula has a cat named ShamWow.

POUNDSTONE: All of this should help you.

COURIC: Are you saying - well, I don't get a second try, do I?

SAGAL: No, well, you - I - until I tell you the answer, you can still flail about.

COURIC: Oh, really?

SAGAL: Yes.

COURIC: Oh, C.

SAGAL: Yes, you're right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: How did you know?

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: He did. And the best thing about this, according to this workplace column in USA Today, is it was one of those open office plans where everybody sits in big tables. So he just set up his bed next to one of those big tables 'cause he liked his naps.

COURIC: Can I - that is super creepy.

SAGAL: It's a little strange. All right. You have one more chance here. If you get this one, you win. A group of interns at NASA did something a little bit wrong in 2003. What was it? A - they stole $21 million worth of moon rocks. B - they accidentally launched a rocket a day early. Or C - they sent out a press release announcing the end of the world via asteroid.

COURIC: Oh, God. Well, they sound all terrible, except for the first one, so I'm going to say the first one.

SAGAL: You're right. They stole $21 million worth of moon rocks.

POUNDSTONE: All right.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And this is interesting. The intern who did it, who led this ring, did it to impress his girlfriend, another intern at NASA. And they didn't just steal the moon rocks. Before they got caught, they made one small step for mankind on top of them.

POUNDSTONE: You know, who can really put a price on moon rocks? Who - how do you value a moon rock? I mean, who...

BODDEN: The cost of fuel to go get it.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Katie Couric do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, she got one wrong, but she drilled deep for the truth and came up with two rights. She's a winner.

SAGAL: Congratulations, Katie.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Katie Couric, of course, is a legendary broadcaster, and her new podcast is called ""Katie Couric.""

COURIC: (Laughter) How original.

SAGAL: Katie, thank you so much. It's such a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks for joining us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

COURIC: Thank you, guys, so much.

FELBER: See you, Katie.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

Any musician can tell you that there is a profound connection between the breath and making music. There's the physical action, of course — one makes the other possible — but there are also the metaphysical bonds between breathing and creating. This connection has been acknowledged and honored since time immemorial: Think of the Latin word spiritus, for example, which means, quite literally, both ""breath"" and ""spirit."" Or, to turn to another tradition: One of the great, ancient Hindu sacred texts, the Mandukya Upanishad, teaches that the syllable ""om"" represents, in its four distinct elements (a-u-m-silence), the entire universe. ""A"" is the initial act of creation; ""u,"" sound resonating and coming into consciousness; ""m,"" sound turning inward as the lips close and the body hums with vibration; and, finally, there comes silence, which is just as integral as sound.

Apart from singers, perhaps no musicians feel that interdependence between breath, music and creation as keenly as wind and brass players. The unusual quartet Battle Trance — comprising four wildly talented tenor saxophonists in leader Travis Laplante, Patrick Breiner, Matt Nelson and Jeremy Viner — makes that meeting place the heart of its new album, Blade Of Love, which the group calls an exploration of ""the physical and spiritual intersection of the saxophone and the human body."" The album is a recording of Laplante's three-part composition of the same name; here, we hear the work's first section, ""Blade Of Love I,"" which references very old music and plunges deeply into very new sounds.

As visceral and inventive as Laplante's writing can be, and as rigorously as he puts his quartet through its paces using extended technique, he also leads his players — and listeners — through a study of sonic contrasts. The piece opens with a sustained, nearly two-minute blast of sound that fairly shakes the listener out of complacency; from there, the musicians shift away from their instruments into cooed chanting that is not unlike medieval polyphony, then retreat into overlapping textures of voice and reeds that call to mind the collaborations between Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek and the British vocal quartet the Hilliard Ensemble.

And yet, Laplante brings Battle Trance somewhere apart from those dreamscapes: on the whole, somewhere more emotionally forceful, less ethereal and far blunter, even when the composer draws his players into tender quietude before casting them into lapping circles of ostinatos and fiendishly difficult flurries of notes. This is a fierce piece, and one that demands attention.

None,http://ethics.npr.org/memos-from-memmott/when-theres-no-evidence-to-support-a-claim-we-should-say-that/,"When There’s No Evidence To Support A Claim, We Should Say That",[],"[u'claim', u'city', u'support', u'evidence', u'celebrating', u'say', u'officials', u'accounts', u'trumps', u'watched', u'thousands', u'jersey', u'theres']","When There’s No Evidence To Support A Claim, We Should Say That

Politicians, public officials and — yes — members of the press will say things that don’t check out.

– Brian Williams’ helicopter was not shot down.

– Hillary Clinton did not have to run to her car because of sniper fire at an airport in Bosnia.

– Toronto Mayor Rob Ford … pick your story.

When we can say some something definitive about such accounts, we should.

The latest case: Donald Trump’s statement that he “watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.”

Regarding that account of what he says happened in New Jersey, we have told our audiences that:

– “Police say it didn’t happen.”

– “Local officials in New Jersey continue to dismiss Trump’s claims.”

– “New Jersey officials say it didn’t happen.”

Those lines add helpful context, but they also create a “he said, she said” situation. Trump says one thing, police and local officials say another. Have we done all we can to help listeners and Web users figure out who’s right?

In situations such as this, we should first ask whether we should repeat the claim. After all, repeating it might give it more life. But if the answer to that question is yes, we should get to the point and say what we’ve found. Here’s how The Two-Way has done it:

“We asked our library to look through contemporaneous news reports. They tell us that that they could not turn up any news accounts of American Muslims cheering or celebrating in the wake of Sept. 11.”

Another way to say that might be: “NPR has searched for credible news accounts about large groups of American Muslims celebrating during or after the Sept. 11 attacks. No such accounts have been found.”

We could also flatly report that “no evidence has been found in police or credible media accounts from the time to indicate there were large numbers of Muslim-Americans in New Jersey celebrating.” We have used the “no evidence” framing on the air.

Regarding The Washington Post report from Sept. 18, 2001, that Trump has cited, it stated that “in Jersey City, within hours of two jetliners’ plowing into the World Trade Center, law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.” But as we said on Morning Edition this week, “there is no reference in the [Washington Post] article to Trump’s claim of seeing thousands and thousands Muslims celebrating in Jersey City.”

FactCheck.org has noted that:

“The Post story said that Jersey City police detained ‘a number of people’ who were ‘allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding a tailgate-style party’ in Jersey City. That allegation was unattributed and unverified. Even if it did happen, and there is no evidence of it, the celebrating was not on TV and did not involve ‘thousands and thousands of people.’ “

Nurith Aizenman’s piece today on Morning Edition is highly recommended listening.

Travon Addison, “an athletic 25-year-old with short cropped hair, a wispy beard and tattoos all over his arms,” takes her through the Sandtown neighborhood of Baltimore. I won’t spoil it by giving away what listeners learned from Addison. You should definitely keep listening to the end. Addison is a compelling character. Nurith and her editors tell his story well.

There are two other things worth noting:

– We use Addison’s full name. That isn’t a minor detail. It helps the piece enormously. In stories in which key characters are not fully identified, we have to explain why. That takes time and can lead listeners to wonder what else that person might be hiding.

Nurith didn’t do what reporters at some news outlets do too often. She didn’t start with the presumption that Addison would want to use just his first name or perhaps even remain anonymous (because he had been arrested earlier in the week). She assumed he would be fully ID’d.

That is NPR’s standard. As we have discussed before, “we name names and do our due diligence.” What’s more, “whether to go with ‘first-name-only’ needs to be discussed and explained.”

Nurith says another person she met in Baltimore — a white woman who was marching with protesters — initially wanted only her first name to be used in any story. The woman said she didn’t want to call attention to herself. Here’s how Nurith convinced the woman to give her full name: by pointing out that doing otherwise could have just called more attention to her and raised questions about why she wanted to cloak her identity.

– We seize the moment. As she headed to Baltimore, Nurith ran through in her mind the sorts of stories she wanted to tell and the voices who could be part of those pieces. Those characters included people who live in Sandtown and could talk about what happened last week and in recent decades.

Nurith heard Addison complaining about how he and others weren’t being heard from and how outsiders don’t know anything about his neighborhood and why there were riots. So she asked him to “show me your Baltimore.”

It was a simple request that produced an excellent story.

More than a week after record-breaking rain inundated 20 parishes in southeastern Louisiana, President Obama arrived Tuesday to survey the damage.

The president toured a neighborhood in East Baton Rouge Parish ravaged in the widespread flooding that has claimed more than a dozen lives and damaged some 60,000 homes. Afterward, he thanked first responders, the National Guard and ""all the good neighbors"" who rescued people as the water rose.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

""I come here, first and foremost, to say that the prayers of the entire nation are with everybody who lost loved ones,"" Obama said. ""We are heartbroken by the loss of life. There are also people who are still desperately trying to track down friends and family. We're going to keep on helping them every way that we can.""

Obama also praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its work on the ground. ""A lot of homes have flood insurance, but a lot of homes don't,"" he said, saying he had advised FEMA chief Craig Fugate to ""get money out as quickly as possible"" to residents who are beginning to rebuild.

""[W]hat I want the people of Louisiana to know is that you're not alone on this,"" Obama said. ""Even after the TV cameras leave, the whole country is going to continue to support you and help you until we get folks back in their homes and lives are rebuilt.""

Before departing Baton Rouge, the president will meet with the family of Alton Sterling, who was shot and killed by a police officer there in July, as well as with the families of local law enforcement officers who were killed and injured by a gunman later that same month.

At least 13 people died in the flooding from a storm that hit the area Aug. 11 and lingered for days. The Red Cross estimates the recovery will cost at least $30 million. President Obama signed a Louisiana disaster declaration on Aug. 14, making federal disaster funding available.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson arrived in Baton Rouge on Aug. 18. His agency is in charge of the federal disaster response.

The White House released a statement the afternoon of Aug. 19, announcing Obama's trip and saying, ""The President is mindful of the impact that his travel has on first responders and wants to ensure that his presence does not interfere with ongoing recovery efforts.""

That same day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate Mike Pence visited areas affected by the flood. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has not toured Louisiana, released a statement saying that ""relief efforts can't afford any distractions"" and urging people to donate.

As NPR's Domenico Montanaro reported at the time:

""The president has been on vacation in Martha's Vineyard and has faced some criticism for not visiting Louisiana. A Louisiana newspaper, The Advocate, wrote in an [Aug. 17] editorial: "" 'Sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good. But we don't see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It's past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans.' ""The Democratic governor of the state, John Bel Edwards, though, has said he has no problem with the president not having visited or the federal response. "" 'I'm not complaining in any way about our federal partnership,' Edwards said in a news conference Thursday.""

In a subsequent editorial today, the Advocate welcomed Obama's visit and called on him to address the housing crisis created by the flood devastation.

The newspaper writes:

""Thousands of displaced homeowners pose the biggest threat to the region's recovery, and some form of housing assistance beyond what FEMA's rules presently allow will almost certainly be necessary. The president can be a key voice in championing that goal. ""A flood that left much of the region underwater means a huge impact on the federal flood insurance program. Now, more than ever, homeowners and businesses will need affordable flood insurance to draw investment to the region. Access to flood insurance is important not only to Louisiana, but communities across America that could easily be surprised by a flood of their own. The president can use his bully pulpit to promote a sustainable flood insurance program as a national priority, and we hope he does so.""

Only about 12 percent of homes in Baton Rouge are covered by flood insurance. In an interview with NPR last week, Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon said, ""The average cost of insuring a home in Louisiana is, for many, a budget-buster.""

He also expressed hope that the recent flooding, which the National Weather Service estimates should theoretically occur only once every 1,000 years, will persuade more homeowners to take advantage of federally subsidized flood insurance programs.

""I live in metropolitan New Orleans, and we have had so-called 100-year floods every five years since 1979,"" Donelon said. ""Those experiences have taught property owners in the metro New Orleans area that it is worthwhile having that coverage."""

The line between editorializing and engaging with the audience is not always easy to see. Also, bloggers, analysts and commentators may be able to do things on social media that we would not want our “traditional” journalists to do.

We have specialists – the social media team – who can help figure out what is and isn’t appropriate. Editors can take a look at tweets and posts before you hit publish. It pays to first ask others on your show or desk for their opinions.

We also have plenty of guidance online:

– The “social media” section of the Ethics Handbook. Here’s an important line: “Conduct yourself online just as you would in any other public circumstances as an NPR journalist.” In other words, if you wouldn’t say it on the air, don’t say it on other platforms.

– This “social media guideline,” which says, in part:

“Refrain from advocating for political or other polarizing issues online. … Don’t express personal views on a political or other controversial issue that you could not write for the air or post on NPR.org. These guidelines apply whether you are posting under your own name or — if the online site allows pseudonyms — your identity would not be readily apparent. In reality, anything you post online reflects both on you and on NPR.”

– There’s another guideline that’s helpfully headlined “When In Doubt, Consult The Social Media Team.”

– We have a post called “Remember: There Is No Privacy On The Web, And ‘Personal’ Pages Are Not Safe Zones.”

– Finally, these posts point to the particular problems that come with political seasons:

Well, the secret's out on the Austin band whose members composed the epic score for the Netflix original series Stranger Things — but producing horror-score-influenced compositions is nothing new for S U R V I V E. For almost a decade, the band has explored these sounds with drum machines and analog synths. Now, it's preparing to release its second full-length record, RR7349, this September.

""Wardenclyffe"" is a slow-mo synth chugger that would be as effective in your local cinema during a Halloween double feature as it would on the dance floor in your local discotheque. The standout track, like much of S U R V I V E's music, gives nods to John Carpenter and Goblin with its space-age synthesizers and tension-inducing, rolling bass. Still, the band's composition of these sounds is truly something unique.

""Wardenclyffe"" begins with a 4/4 kick, a distorted snare figure and a simple, yet effective, driving synth bass. As the track continues, the band introduces some of the sci-fi ambience characteristic of the Stranger Things score, and the bass line transforms into arpeggios. These ominous progressions continue as the track's tension builds; meanwhile, further melodic layers are introduced, slowly shining a light and generating a sense of hope in the darkness. A break in the drums and a modulating, cosmic synth pad pave the way to a cinematic crescendo that could soundtrack the heroic ending of your favorite sci-fi horror film or your most euphoric, hands-in-the-air moment in the club.

RR7349 comes out Sept. 30 on Relapse."

""I'll Take You There"" is a 24/7 R&B and soul channel from NPR Music. Curated and hosted by Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, the playlist runs the gamut from the genre's origins in the 1940s to today's slow jam stunners. You can follow the program on Twitter at @NPRandB and Jason King's personal Twitter account at @jasonkingsays.

Rhythm and blues is a feeling. Rhythm and blues is about getting up to get down to get on the good foot to get happy and enjoy yourself when the suffering hits, when the blues wants to envelop you like a fog.

In the 1940s, R&B was the marketing term journalist-turned-Atlantic Records-producer Jerry Wexler coined to describe the raucous and jumpy sounds African-Americans were concocting in urban hotspots like New Orleans; it was a newfangled phrase to lift black music from the racist connotation of ""race music."" Rhythm and blues was '40s shouters like Wynonie Harris hollering over tight, post-swing rhythm combos — it was three-dimensional bass lines bouncing around driving beats and spastic saxophones honking like farm pigs.

By the '50s, white folks repackaged the music as rock 'n' roll, but it wasn't long before R&B sprouted new arms, extending itself into the gospelized frenzy of soul, the stairstep harmonies of doo-wop, the cool crossover pop of Motown, the hot circular grooves of funk in the '60s, the boudoir hush of quiet storm and the aspirational sleekness of disco in the '70s. But R&B also left its trace on Jamaican reggae, Nigerian afrobeat, Ghanaian highlife, Chicago and Detroit house, not to mention '80s boogie, synth-funk and hi-NRG, and all those British post-Northern-soul variants. Contrary to popular wisdom, the rise of drum machines and samplers in the '80s and '90s never killed R&B: the music only mutated, reformed, transmogrified and got itself a brand new bag in the form of new jack swing, hip-hop-soul, neo-soul, broken beat and drum 'n' bass. The energy never dies.

At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways.

What links R&B across all that space and time is its emphasis on dance, sex and romance. At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways. It's about being overjoyed and underpaid and living for the weekend and turning your house into a home. It's the music of picket lines and picket signs, of sin and salvation, of hustles, twists and Soul Trains. It's the soundtrack of cities being burned by riots, of communities struggling to be free, of people darker than blue saying it loud and proud to be right on and free. It's the music of corner bars and shabeens and dancehalls and supermarkets and bathhouses and weddings and barbecues and family reunions. It's happy feelings and silent tears, hot grits and raining men, tempestuous telephone calls and profound pillow talk. It's feel-deep music, vibration and frequency meant to resonate in the marrow of your bones and the cells of your blood.

I've curated a 24/7 stream of thousands of songs for NPR that reflect the vast range of what R&B was and what it is and where it's going. You're likely to hear anything from Aretha Franklin to Little Richard to Sylvester to Jodeci to Ruth Brown to IG Culture to Carl Hall to Disclosure to Dinah Washingtonto Roy Ayers to Kelela to The Righteous Brothers to Jorge Ben to Amos Milburn to Jeff Buckley to Louis Jordan. It's all elemental — earth, fire, water and wind music for the body, spirit and mind."

Just southwest of bustling Charleston, S.C., lies a lush and rural gem called Wadmalaw Island, one of the Sea Islands that dot the shoreline. This is the home of the Charleston Tea Plantation, the only commercial tea plantation in North America.

Here, 127 acres of gleaming dark green tea bushes unfold in endless rows, framed against light-green fields and silvery loops of Spanish moss that festoon the oak trees. With its sandy soils, subtropical climate and generous yearly rainfall of about 50 inches, Wadmalaw is an ideal home for tea.

Rather than planting tea seeds, the Charleston Tea Plantation grows cuttings in a nursery for four years. The fledgling bushes are descendants of the same Camellia sinensis plants that were first brought to the Carolinas in the 1700s by French botanist Andre Michaux.

The plantation is owned by the Bigelow Tea Co., in partnership with third-generation tea taster William Barclay Hall, a fellow with a magnificent passion for tea and the knowledge to match it.

I spoke with Hall about the tea business while sipping a cool cuppa and gazing out at the glimmering rows of tea plants flowing like green scarves to the horizon.

Your grandfather and father were professional tea tasters. How did you become one, too?

My father suggested I go into tea. Back then you had to have family connections to be trained. London was the center of the world trade in tea at the time, and every week teas were sent to London to be auctioned off. I tasted as many as 800 teas a day, five days a week. The goal was to be able to blind taste 10 teas and identify each one's country and region of origin, and even the tea plant used.

Were those many hundreds of cups of teas simply laid out for tasting?

About 80 were laid out at a time, on long benches. You would taste them all along with a buyer, then everything would be cleaned up and 80 more teas would be laid out.

Though there is only one tea plant, Camellia sinensis, there are thousands of varieties. But they don't have names like Golden Delicious or Granny Smith — they have numbers. Believe it or not, all of the teas become individual to you. We have a special terminology for tea that ... is hard to convey to an outsider. We might say, ""This tea has good character."" Well, what does character taste like? Or ""This tea is out of condition, that one is bright, that one is brisk, and this one is burnt.""

Those descriptors are very important, because tea is one of the few commodities in the world bought and sold strictly on taste. And what makes teas so interesting, as opposed to, say, grapes, is that tea is harvested every 15-18 days. Grapes are harvested once a year — and you either have a good, bad or indifferent year. But tea is changing all the time. Is it too hot or cold this month? Is it the beginning, middle or end of the season? Did we have too much rain? All this influences the flavor of the tea.

Tell us a little about how you grow the teas here.

We don't use any pesticide, herbicides or fungicides. Tea is naturally pest resistant, because the caffeine and tannins repel insects. We use a custom irrigation system. We plant the bushes in long rows, very close together, with just enough space between the rows for the mechanical harvester to fit. That way, very little light filters down between the rows, and very few weeds or random tea seeds sprout. We dry the leaves on ""withering box"" screens for 18 hours, then macerate them in a grinder. I then steep and taste and blend each batch until it tastes just right.

You live on the property full time. How do you like it?

What could be better than a life centered around tea? Nothing, absolutely nothing. People all over the world start and end their days with tea. It's hardy, lives hundreds of years, requires no tilling of the soil and you can plant 5,200 oxygen-producing plants in every acre. It's healthy for you. I love it here so much that I will eat everything out of my refrigerator, even down to my last jar of mayonnaise, before I leave the plantation and go to the city to shop for food. Tea is the greatest crop in the world.

NPR's Rachel Martin talks with Lisa Fenn, the author of ""Carry On: A Story of Resilience, Redemption, and an Unlikely Family,"" and the two athletes Fenn profiled, Dartanyon Crockett and Leroy Sutton.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

It was February of 2009, and Lisa Fenn was working as a features producer for ESPN. Her dad knew she was always looking for a good story, so when he saw a write-up in his local Cleveland paper about two high school wrestlers with an unusual bond, he told her she should check it out. She did, and she was awestruck by the friendship she found between these two young men, Leroy Sutton and Dartanyon Crockett, each working to overcome the incredible roadblocks life had thrown in their way.

Leroy lost both his legs in a train accident when he was just 11 years old. Dartanyon is legally blind and, when Lisa met him, essentially homeless. Neither young man let any of that stand in their way when it came to competing on and off the mat. Lisa has written a new book called ""Carry On"" about Leroy and Dartanyon and how her own life has been changed by these two young men.

All three of them join me now from the studios of Colorado Public Radio in Denver. Hey, you guys. Thanks so much for being with us.

LEROY SUTTON: Thank you for having us.

DARTANYON CROCKETT: Thank you for having us.

LISA FENN: Thank you.

MARTIN: So Leroy and Dartanyon, I summarized how Lisa first heard about the two of you, but when did you first hear that there was this ESPN producer cruising around who wanted to do a story on you? And when you met her, what were your first impressions? And I'll start with Leroy.

SUTTON: I had previous experience with a media type, so I wasn't really accepting. But our coach did come up to us, and he stated that we should be open to talking to her. But I was still kind of, like, reluctant to do so.

MARTIN: How come?

SUTTON: With my previous experience with media, it was just kind of they'd come up, do their job and then disappear.

FENN: I think after Leroy's accident, he got a lot of coverage from local and some national media, and a lot of the coverage sort of painted him as this inspirational kid who had stared down the mighty locomotive, been overcome. But in fact, in his personal life and his home life he was, you know, very much languishing in the effects of trauma and of poverty. And it wasn't quite as shiny as people were led to believe by the media coverage. So I think what he's come to understand was that in some ways, as a vulnerable 11-year-old boy, he felt used by that.

MARTIN: Dartanyon, how did you feel about the situation? I mean, did you share that skepticism that Leroy had?

CROCKETT: Yes and no.

SUTTON: No.

CROCKETT: For me, it was like, about time. I've been working hard at this wrestling crap, I'm a good athlete, and about time someone wants to ask me questions about something and put me on some sort of sports network. And so I kind of jumped at the idea of being interviewed by Lisa. I'm like, oh man.

MARTIN: Dartanyon, you were already on the wrestling team at Lincoln West when Leroy came on, right?

CROCKETT: Mm-hmm (ph).

MARTIN: So what was your reaction and that of your teammates when you heard a guy with no legs was going to join?

CROCKETT: I was, like, one of the guys who was quick to wrestle him because everybody else was like, I don't know what to do with that.

SUTTON: I don't know what to do.

CROCKETT: We just worked ankle picks last week and coach, you can't - you're not giving me anything to work with here (laughter).

MARTIN: So this whole interaction, your relationship with Lisa, started because she saw this picture of you, right? The two of you.

CROCKETT: Right.

MARTIN: Dartanyon carrying Leroy.

SUTTON: Me riding my mighty steed.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: You on the back of Dartanyon.

CROCKETT: Black stallion.

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: So this was a thing that started happening. Dartanyon, you carried Leroy up and down stairs, inside gyms, on and off buses that your team would take to meets. So it was clear to you, Lisa, probably from the beginning - right? - that these two shared a unique kind of friendship. But when did you realize that this was an altogether different kind of story? Because by this point in your career as a producer for ESPN, this was the thing you did. You did, like, these kind of very emotional, inspirational stories about athletes. So how did you start thinking of this in a different way?

FENN: The day that my father alerted me to that picture - in the photo, there was just something different about it to me. When I finally saw them in person, I was even more moved and touched by - and though they joke around a lot, just the mere act of carrying one another, there's a tenderness involved in that. There's a vulnerability involved in that. That's not sort of the norm in teen urban culture. But, you know, as I spent time in their school - and it's a hardened place. There's - it's - it is. And so to see this expression of compassion and this expression of self-sacrifice, it just stood out to me as really extraordinary.

MARTIN: The film came out in 2009. Lisa, can you describe the response?

FENN: It was overwhelming in the best possible way. Within a few minutes of it airing I started receiving emails from viewers, and they were enamored by Leroy and Dartanyon. They were really touched by their expression of friendship, and they were moved to want to help them. Most of them were offering money to get them to college. They were offering new ramps and wheelchairs and scholarships and really just an overwhelming number of opportunities and ideas to help these two into sustainable futures.

MARTIN: We should say in total, you got pledges for more than $40,000. Is that right?

FENN: Yeah, it was close to $50,000. And then on top of that, there were three really generous families offering to pay their college tuitions themselves.

MARTIN: You talk about this book - the subtitle's ""A Story Of Resilience, Redemption, And An Unlikely Family."" You did start feeling a kind of maternal sense towards these two guys.

FENN: Yeah, I definitely did for Dartanyon, who lost his mother when he was 8 years old, and for Leroy, who has had difficulties with his mother stemming from his trauma. They both had a hole in their lives for a mother figure, and I just feel really blessed that they let me have that kind of relationship with them.

MARTIN: Fast-forward, a lot of things have changed. You got Dartanyon in touch with the Paralympics. And Dartanyon, you have switched your sport. I don't know if you still wrestle, but now you are into judo. You won a bronze at the 2012 Games in London, which is awesome. Congratulations for that.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

MARTIN: And soon you're going to head to Rio to compete in this year's Paralympics, right?

CROCKETT: Yep.

MARTIN: And Leroy, you've graduated from college. You're working as a videogame tester. I guess I would ask both of you - Dartanyon first - how have your expectations for your life changed since you met Lisa?

CROCKETT: It put me in a position to where I - if I don't have a certain resource, I know how to find it. If I don't have certain people in my life who know the answers to the questions that I have, I can find the people who might. And it gave me tools to create my own avenue of wherever I wanted to go in life.

MARTIN: And Leroy?

SUTTON: The way that I've changed is I'm more open to people. When we speak at schools, I'll spend a lot of time talking to some of the kids just to get a sense of what they're going through.

MARTIN: Lisa, when you look back, how have these two young men changed you?

FENN: On a personal level, they are my family. I don't know that they've changed my family, but they've become my family. And I also have a 6-year-old son who's adopted, and he's African-American. And he believes Leroy and Dartanyon - he believes correctly that they are his big brothers. So much so that for his sixth birthday, he asked for a wheelchair for his birthday...

(LAUGHTER)

FENN: ...Because he wants to be like his brother Leroy. And that's beautiful to me, that race, that disability has normalized in my family setting because I think it's a reflection of what we've - what we want for our society.

MARTIN: Lisa Fenn. Her new book is called ""Carry On: A Story Of Resilience, Redemption, And An Unlikely Family."" We were also joined by Leroy Sutton and Dartanyon Crockett. Thanks to all three of you.

SUTTON: Thank you.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

FENN: Thank you, Rachel.

MARTIN: And Dartanyon, good luck in Rio.

CROCKETT: Thank you.

The Terror Years From Al-Qaeda to the Islamic State by Lawrence Wright Hardcover, 366 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Author Lawrence Wright was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, which meant he was required to do two years of what was called ""alternative service."" He ended up in Egypt, teaching at the American University in Cairo. And it was there that the man from Texas started his obsession with the Middle East.

Since then, Wright has written a lot about the region and about terrorism as a staff writer for The New Yorker. Now, he has compiled his many New Yorker essays into a new book called The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State.

But his interest in terrorism stretches back to well before his New Yorker job ... back to a screenwriting gig in the 1990s. He tells NPR's Kelly McEvers that the 1998 film The Siege asked ""what would happen if terrorism came here? As it already had in, say, London and Paris, you know, how would we react if it happened in New York?""

Interview Highlights

On people's reactions to The Siege after the Sept. 11 attacks

It was the most rented movie in America after 9/11 ... I think there were two things — one was, it explained and looked at the problem of terrorism. But the other thing is, the movie has a happy ending, and after 9/11, people weren't sure how this movie was going to end.

On his piece about John O'Neill, ""The Counter-Terrorist""

If you recall, the planes were all grounded [after the attacks], and I lived in Austin, so I was unable to get to New York for several days, and I was desperate to get involved in this. I didn't know how to reduce this vast tragedy to a human scale. So I was combing through obituaries streaming online, and on this Washington Post site, I found O'Neill's obituary. And it made him out to be something of a disgrace. He had been the head of counterterrorism in New York, and he'd been washed out of the [FBI] because he'd taken classified information out of the office. And then he wound up getting a job as head of security at the World Trade Center.

You know, his job was to get Osama bin Laden, and instead bin Laden got him. And I thought at the time it was ironic. But I don't see it that way anymore. He took that job because he knew that al-Qaida would come and try to finish the job on the World Trade Center — they had bombed it once before in 1993 — so he instinctively put himself at ground zero ... it was O'Neill and a handful of people that really realized the peril that America was in.

On the Americans held captive and killed by the Islamic State, and what might have been done differently

I'm not saying that they might have been able to survive. Unless the American government had taken the same policy as the Europeans, which was simply to pay off the kidnappers. But the American government opposes that, and also at the time opposed any Americans, even the parents of these individuals, paying to ransom their child. So essentially, the parents were left by themselves. They had no idea how to deal with ISIS, and they got very little help from the State Department or the FBI ... there was rarely any moment when the FBI or the State Department shared information or offered to help in any meaningful way.

On the relevance of al-Qaida in the age of ISIS

Well, al-Qaida is the parent, with all the progeny that has multiplied all over the world. If you call it al-Qaida or bin Ladenism or jihadism, whatever you call it, it's proliferated. So yes, the mother organization has been reduced — it's not extinct, but it has certainly been confined. But the idea that they have put forward is alive in the world and spreading rapidly, unfortunately.

On how we've changed in America

Well, I was reflecting about how, when I was in high school, I took a date to Love Field in Dallas. That was actually the name of the airport, but it was where a lot of dates went when you didn't have any money. And I remember that we climbed into this airliner that had just come from some European place — we decided it must have been Paris — and we sat in the first class compartment, and the stewardesses, as you called them then, brought us a snack, and we pretended we were really cosmopolitan. And then we went up in the FAA tower, ""Come on in, kids!"" So we sat down and watched these airplanes land. And that was America.

And I'm so struck, just going into an office building where you have to be photographed. In Philadelphia, you go visit the Liberty Bell and you have to take off your shoes and your belt. These impingements on ordinary liberty — the kinds of things we took entirely for granted, those are gone. But if they're forgotten they'll be permanently gone. And I think that it's important that we keep in our minds the idea of that kind of freedom, and if we lose that, then I think terrorism really will have won."

When Frank Ocean released his version of The Isley Brothers' Quiet Storm classic ""At Your Best (You Are Love)"" last week, it was both a flower left at a grave and an investment in the future. Posted on the boundary-blending singer-songwriter's Tumblr the day after what would have been Aaliyah's 36th birthday, the new track was widely received as a tribute to the late singer, whose death at 22 in a plane crash halted one of the most promising careers in '90s pop. Aaliyah included the song on her 1994 debut album Age Ain't Nothin' But a Number, and it was her first ballad to break through on the charts. A comparison of Ocean's interpretation to his heroine's, and to the original 1976 version by the Isley Brothers, points toward something more: the way in which Ocean is reimagining R&B by responding to its legacies in his own coolly audacious way.

Listen to Frank Ocean's version of ""At Your Best (You Are Love)""

Ocean's take begins with a heartbeat rhythm, just a couple of pulses on a keyboard. Then his falsetto takes over. It's viscous and commanding, fulfilling that register's irresistibly persuasive potential. ""An artfully cultivated falsetto, crooned by an Al Green or a Bee Gee, has become a vocalized foreplay,"" the critic Anthony Heilbut once wrote; Ocean is well aware he's unbuttoning every shirt within his reach. The echo he applies surrounds his loving words like a wet cloud.

YouTube

Compare even the first notes of Ocean's version (renamed ""You Are Luhh"" for the Internet age) to Aaliyah's; a story emerges that's more complex than a come-on. ""At Your Best (You Are Love)"" is the only song on Aaliyah's debut not penned by her then-paramour R. Kelly, an Isley Brothers acolyte who enlisted his muse to pay tribute in an arrangement very close to the original. A remix later made the song a hit by adding a typical '90s beat and various murmured interjections from Kelly. The album version, though, shows Aaliyah very gently pulling the song away from the much older man then dominating her life. It begins a capella, showcasing the singer's trademark flute-like head voice. As the arrangement unfolds, satin, around her, she takes in each phrase and makes the listener consider it, moving slowly and deliberately, as if she's explaining something. The vocal is not sexy. It's reassuring, like an embrace from a dear friend or even a family member.

YouTube

In fact, ""At Your Best (You Are Love)"" was originally dedicated to the Isley Brothers' mother, Sally, and in the original, Ronal Isley takes a thoughtful approach that turns ever more slightly seductive as the song goes on. His gentle sighs halfway through the song do signal a surrender that's anything but filial, but when his brothers join in angelically on the bridge, the song seems like it could serve any heart's need. The multi-layered meanings of the Isleys' balladry were key in establishing the Quiet Storm style — an African-American counterpart to soft rock, stimulating the sweet dreams of aspirational listeners, many of them working women, in the calmer but still transformative years after the Black Power movement's peak. Songs like ""At Your Best (You Are Love),"" with lyrics like ""you're a positive motivating force within my life,"" stressed individual strength and fulfillment as an important part of uplifting the race.

Ocean's artful move is to create a kind of dialogue between Aaliyah and Ronald Isley in his song, showing how the loveman and the ingénue can coexist within one consciousness. His voice is actually pitched higher than Aaliyah's, and it's even more minimal. Someone with a Jungian psychoanalytic bent might say he's leaning heavily into his anima on those heavenward notes. But he also drops into a lower register, recalling how Ronald Isley employed his supple tenor to inject some machismo into his most tender pronouncements. Ending on a high note, Ocean makes us think about the way Aaliyah herself managed to be assertive even when gentle, and how her claim on a performance by one of soul's most revered father figures made a case for giving the feminine voice equal respect, even when it expressed itself quietly.

Frank Ocean is hardly unusual in embracing a fluid gender identity while working within the R&B idiom. From Little Richard to Sam Cooke to Etta James to Jimi Hendrix to Patti Labelle to Prince to Aaliyah herself, the artists who've moved the legacy forward have had deep fun expanding on received notions of ""man"" and ""woman."" Ocean's contribution is to explode stereotypes without a lot of bravado; he's naturally more than one person at once. This simple musical gesture toward the softest voice and one of the most resonant mighty ones, highlighting the opposite qualities in each, shows how we all are multiple beings, in truth."

Sometimes we say “honed in” when we mean “homed in.” Within minutes, we hear from listeners or readers who wonder why we don’t know the difference between “hone” and “home.”

They want us to save “hone” for when we’re talking about sharpening, and to use “home” when we’re saying that something or someone has been targeted.

Those folks are sticklers and that’s OK. What they rarely acknowledge, though, is that there’s a lot of fine honing in the work we do.

Look at how much information was packed into two Newscast obits this morning:

– “Renowned TV and film writer and director Garry Marshall has died in Burbank, Calif., at the age of 81. His publicist says he had pneumonia following a stroke. He was behind many TV hits such as Happy Days. Other Marshall hits included Laverne and Shirley, Mork and Mindy and films such as Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries. Marshall had supporting roles in Lost in America and in Soap Dish.” (Korva Coleman) – “The creator of the 1970s and ‘80s TV sitcoms Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley and Mork and Mindy has died. Garry Marshall was 81 years old. He died at a hospital in Burbank, Calif., of complications from pneumonia; following a stroke. Actor Richard Gere worked with Marshall on the film Pretty Woman. He says Marshall was one of the funniest men who ever lived, with a heart of pure gold.” (Dave Mattingly)

Listen to the top of Morning Edition’s roundup of news from the GOP convention. Steve Inskeep quickly wraps up the campaign so far, folds in news from last night and sets up listeners for three wonderful clips:

“Months of brutal campaigning for president concluded with a quaint American tradition last night. State delegations cast their ballots for president at the Republican National Convention. It’s a chance to promote your candidate for the nomination; and also your state.”

Revisit the way Weekend All Things Considered opened its look at policing. With short, declarative sentences and the effective use of clips, the show prepared listeners for a powerful hour. Michel Martin then kept things simple:

“After all that’s happened this week, indeed, after all that’s happened in recent years and confrontations between citizens and law enforcement that have resulted in deaths and injury among both, we decided to take this entire hour to talk about policing. “Almost all of our guests today are or have been directly involved in law enforcement, and we’ll be talking with them about the work they do, why they do it and whether they think the system is broken. We’ll talk about how they cope with the stresses of the job, and we’ll be talking with folks who’ve looked at the latest research around policing to ask them what, if anything, should be done differently.”

Read these concluding paragraphs from Linda Holmes’ appreciation of The Great British Baking Show (which I also love):

“What emerges over the course of the show is that it doesn’t only have a style; it has an ethic. Mary and Paul do not fall victim to the misdirection of small but spectacular-looking mistakes. If the custard in the middle of whatever you’re making doesn’t quite set, the entire thing may collapse and run all over the counter, but they’ll taste it anyway! And they’ll tell you that your custard not setting isn’t necessarily a bigger mistake than anything else; it just looks worse. If you can’t get your cake put together, they’ll still taste the layers. You may not be out. Do not lose heart. Do not lose heart. “Don’t laugh, but this is life, in a way, as we all hope for it to be. You screw up, but not entirely. You see your hoped-for result dashed on the counter in a pile of goop, but someone says, “I see what you put into this; I see what you intended.” Someone you trust who is better than you are at whatever you’re trying to do says, “We both see what you did wrong; I can help you identify what you did right.” You still might lose. You still might go home crying with disappointment. But someone will have said, “Next time, take it out of the oven five minutes sooner and you’ll really have something.” It’s a show of such … hope. Hoping everybody else is going to be willing to try the imperfect layers of your particular not-quite-put-together cake is often the only way to get through the day, after all. “It will also really make you want to learn to make macaroons. Though that might be just me.”

Check out this carefully crafted phrase from Camila Domonske’s Two-Way opus on Larry the Cat and the rumors that he hasn’t been a very competent prime mouser:

“Slurs on Larry’s efficacy continued to dog him.”

The list could go on. The point is that while we may not always use the word “honing” correctly, we do know very well how to hone.

Voice actor and comedian H. Jon Benjamin released a jazz album in which he plays piano. Unfortunately, he cannot play the piano at all. NPR's Robert Siegel talks with Benjamin about his album Well, I Should Have...Learned How to Play Piano. This story originally aired on Jan. 19, 2016 on All Things Considered.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

There's an interview we did on the show earlier this year that whenever someone brings it up, it's hard not to laugh. Robert did this one. And if you didn't hear it the first time or even if you did, enjoy. Here you go.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

Jon Benjamin is a comedian and voice actor best known for playing the title roles on the animated series ""Bob's Burgers"" and ""Archer."" He's also the voice of a can of vegetables in the movie ""Wet Hot American Summer."" He's been a comedian for more than 20 years. And none of that is why we've invited him on the show. We have him here because of the most public radio of reasons. He has recorded an experimental jazz album.

JON BENJAMIN: Thank you for having me.

SIEGEL: You recorded this album with three other musicians - a bass player, a drummer and a saxophonist. You're on piano.

BENJAMIN: Yep.

SIEGEL: And I want us to listen to some of this track.

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

SIEGEL: This track is called ""I Can't Play Piano..."" (Laughter) I'm sorry. I can't say it.

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

SIEGEL: This is called, ""I Can't Play Piano, Part Two."" (Laughter) and it's obvious, you can't play piano.

BENJAMIN: I really can't, and it really shows.

SIEGEL: (Laughter) And yet here you are...

BENJAMIN: Yeah.

SIEGEL: Playing with some guys who seem to know what they're doing.

BENJAMIN: They were very accomplished jazz musicians that I played with - and me.

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

SIEGEL: The name of this album is, ""Well, I Should Have"" subtitle ""Learned How To Play Piano.""

BENJAMIN: Yeah, it's very literal.

SIEGEL: Now, you're playing with professional jazz musicians - Scott Kreitzer on sax, David Finck on bass, and Jonathan Peretz is playing drums. Was this an act of friendship or just a measure of the jazz economy that you got to do whatever gig comes along?

BENJAMIN: They were very nice to do it, and I'm not sure they realized what they were doing till we got there. And then they were mad but not mad enough to stop all together. So they went through it, and they were great.

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

SIEGEL: Well, (laughter)...

BENJAMIN: That is real untapped untalent.

SIEGEL: (Laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

BENJAMIN: He's good.

SIEGEL: Yeah. He knows what he's doing, yeah.

BENJAMIN: He really does.

SIEGEL: Yeah.

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

BENJAMIN: But that's just not as interesting.

SIEGEL: I think it lacks the complete sense of free-form surprise that we have...

BENJAMIN: Right.

SIEGEL: ...When you're actually...

BENJAMIN: He's not taking any risk.

SIEGEL: (Laughter).

BENJAMIN: He just knows how to do it.

SIEGEL: How safe to actually...

BENJAMIN: I feel bad for people like that, yeah.

SIEGEL: (Laughter)

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

SIEGEL: Are you going to do any live performances to promote this?

BENJAMIN: Well, it's funny. I've been asked a couple times, but I'm not sure I want to do that. I'm really going to dedicate myself to learning how to play, and maybe my next album will be decent.

SIEGEL: Is that right? Are you trying to learn how to play?

BENJAMIN: I've started taking lessons, so...

SIEGEL: (Laughter) I see. You're sort of charting a reverse career which begins with the recording contract...

BENJAMIN: (Laughter) It's a real insult to people who try.

SIEGEL: ...And then eventually makes its way to actual lessons on the instrument.

BENJAMIN: I mean, look; I've - there's a distinct possibility that I'll be very good.

SIEGEL: (Laughter).

BENJAMIN: I don't know, like, how it's going to turn out. I just started doing the lessons, so I might be incredibly good.

(SOUNDBITE OF JON BENJAMIN SONG, ""I CAN'T PLAY PIANO, PART TWO"")

SIEGEL: Well, Jon Benjamin, thanks a lot for talking with us about your album ""Well I Should Have... Learned To Play The Piano.""

Youth, energy, angst and bravado — that's the stuff of punk music. But it turns out youth may be the least critical part of the equation.

For 38 years, Milo Aukerman and Bill Stevenson have been pounding out punk music as Descendents, along with their fellow bandmembers Karl Alvarez and Stephen Egerton. They started their band in high school, and now they're in their early fifties. Their new album, Hypercaffium Spazzinate, gets its name from Aukerman's days working in the field of molecular biology.

NPR's Scott Simon spoke to the band about growing up, getting old, and making music about each other. Hear the radio version at the link above, and read the edited version below.

Scott Simon: You guys have a lot of years invested in this, don't you?

Bill Stevenson: Thirty-eight, I guess? We started the band when we were in high school and now we're geezers. We're 52 and 53, respectively. Dis-respectively.

Milo Aukerman, you've been going back and forth. You pursued a career in biochemistry, I'm told.

Milo Aukerman: I worked on plant genetics for the past two decades at this point. But very recently hung my hat up on that. I'm not really doing that right now.

And the relationship between plant genetics and punk is...

Aukerman: Zero. I can't think of a single thing they have in common.

Stevenson: What Milo will likely be remembered for happened in some of the very last days of his lab science career. He happened upon this reagent that, when blended with coffee, created a buzz effect that was many many times greater than what normal coffee could give you. He named it ""hypercaffium spazzinate"" — we were thinking one day you'll see that on the periodic table, we're lobbying for that — but I think when it comes down to it, that will be the great achievement that Milo will be remembered for.

Aukerman: Yeah, as well as the explosion that ensues.

Stevenson: Well, we don't want to talk about the explosion, Milo.

Aukerman: Sorry.

Milo, can I get you to talk about the song ""Testosterone""?

Aukerman: I was working at a mega-corporation and dealt a lot with alpha males. That song is kind of about dealing with them and my desperate attempt to try and keep up with not being an alpha male myself and not really feeling that macho, and that made me think, ""I just gotta dose up the way they're dosed up.""

There are people who leave corporate life for a number of different reasons, but they don't like the pace, they don't like the values. We do stories about them and they often become, I don't know, organic bakers. The world of punk is pretty tough too, isn't it?

Aukerman: That's the odd thing, you'd think I'd have plenty of testosterone coursing through my veins from all the punk rock. But I'm actually by nature a very shy person, so how I ended up being in a punk rock band is kind of a mystery. I think it just became kind of an alter ego.

I want to ask about one of your most sensitive songs, ""Comeback Kid."" Bill Stevenson, could you set that up for us?



Stevenson: Milo wrote it for me a few years ago. A few years ago I had a massive brain tumor, and once the tumor was diagnosed and surgically removed, I had a rebirth of sorts. And I felt better than I had felt in 20 years, and I still do — I still can't believe that I'm 52 because I feel more like 30. But that brain tumor had been in there for a while, just making me slow and making me old and making me depressed, and when I didn't know I was in there I just thought, ""Oh, I'm getting old. This isn't fun."" But then when they took the tumor out it was magic, I feel so great now, this is cool! I want to be alive again.



Aukerman: 2009 is when he had this thing, and in 2010 is when he had this surgery. We were on a hiatus at that point and it energized the whole band and got me thinking, I want to get back in there. It turned into this snowball of great feelings around his recovery.

I love this song. I love the line ""Comeback kid, it's exciting to watch you live.""

Aukerman: I think that's what it was for me. Literally, when he called me after the surgery — granted, he was on a variety of medications post-surgery, but he sounded like he was on Cloud 9 — I just got wrapped up in it. It was a very emotional phone call that he gave me.

Stevenson: Yeah. From another perspective too, it wasn't many years prior to that that Karl had had a heart attack. So I think that when I came out of brain surgery — it may have just been a time when the four of us were thinking, ""We're not going to be here forever, so we should enjoy our band that we started together, we should enjoy it now while we're still able to."" For lack of a better way of saying it, before one of us kicks the bucket.

Did everything you went through make you appreciate each other and the blessing that you have to bring this music to people?

Aukerman: I mean, all of our songs are kind of autobiographical. And so I think, as you go through the record, each song is directed at another member of the band or is a shared sentiment among the band, and then the final song is the triumphant core to the whole thing because it talks about how we started. It's kind of our little history less as a band 38 years ago starting out in the garage with carpeting on the walls. That song we had to have last because it's the capper to the whole autobiographical nature of our songwriting.

It's been a rough summer for supporters of Donald Trump.

A convention that aimed for harmony had some disharmony. The candidate picked arguments with a Gold Star family and with Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Polls have shown Trump falling behind.

At a recent rally in Altoona, Pa., Trump told the crowd that the only way he could lose Pennsylvania — a state where he is polling well behind Democratic rival Hillary Clinton — would be in the event of a fix.

""The only way they can beat it, in my opinion, and I mean this 100 percent, if in certain sections of the state, they cheat,"" Trump said. As NPR has reported, Trump's suggestion could be difficult to prove come Election Day but does touch on voters' distrust of government and growing polarization.

NPR's Robert Siegel went to central Pennsylvania — a Trump stronghold — to ask some members of his strongest demographic group, white men, whether they agree with that notion.

Among those supporters are three generations of a farm family, Jim Walizer, 82, Dennis Walizer, 57, and Jason Walizer, 22. Siegel also spoke with Mike Grimm, president and CEO of the American Eagle Paper Mills; and Chris Baker, a rising senior at Penn State University, who is the leader of the campus group We Are For Trump.

Baker credits Trump for getting so many people to pay attention to the presidential election.

""Everyone is looking at the election now; everyone is looking at politics now,"" he said. ""If this was Jeb Bush vs. Hillary Clinton, most people would be turning their eyes away.""

Interview Highlights

On why Trump is their candidate

Jason Walizer: We were in this kind of overflow room, packed probably full of a thousand people and 2,000 upstairs in the big, main room. [Trump] actually come down to our room first. And he came in and he said, ""I gotta be honest with you folks, you don't have the nicest real estate in the building, but that's why I wanted to come see you first."" So it just made me feel that much more important.

Dennis Walizer: I think a lot of people who are saying — whether they're for or against the candidate — may be a little bit afraid of what the label is going to be put on them. When they get to the voting polls, and it's a secret ballot, things could be totally different.

Mike Grimm: Successful people are usually successful for a reason. And that really comes down to the people that you surround yourself with. [Trump] thinks like an executive. Is he an expert? Absolutely not. But I do believe that he can find the right people. That's my trust.

Chris Baker: I identify myself as a Libertarian. When this originally started, my top three candidates in order were Rand Paul, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump. I liked Rand Paul because he supports the Constitution. I liked Bernie Sanders because he represents the people. And I like Donald Trump because he represents himself. He's an individual. The rest of the candidates, they represent interest groups and lobbyists and people funding their campaigns.

On Trump's claims of possible voter fraud in Pennsylvania

Jason Walizer: Yeah, I would say that's possible. Absolutely. There's so much corruption around Hillary right now. How could I not believe that?

Jim Walizer: I think it's possible either way. And we think voter fraud in Philadelphia is pretty high.

Dennis Walizer: So, when you get things that close [a margin of 1 percent], it doesn't take much of a fraud or anything to sway the election.

On Trump's feud with the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq

Grimm: [Trump] fans the flames way more than anybody should. That's not my style. That's not most people's style. That's why we turn our nose a little bit sometimes when you get in a fight with a couple of parents that lost their son. I don't care what their religion is, we shouldn't be picking a fight with 'em period. So that's generally where I'm at. Could I change my mind? I can't see myself voting for Hillary.

Baker: Trump was wrong for attacking [the Khan family]. Their son, what he did, is something I could never do. He's more courageous than I would have ever been for this country. I didn't go into the armed services. But I don't think that it was right for them to use the death of their son as a microphone to attack another candidate."

The Terror Years From Al-Qaeda to the Islamic State by Lawrence Wright Hardcover, 366 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Author Lawrence Wright was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, which meant he was required to do two years of what was called ""alternative service."" He ended up in Egypt, teaching at the American University in Cairo. And it was there that the man from Texas started his obsession with the Middle East.

Since then, Wright has written a lot about the region and about terrorism as a staff writer for The New Yorker. Now, he has compiled his many New Yorker essays into a new book called The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State.

But his interest in terrorism stretches back to well before his New Yorker job ... back to a screenwriting gig in the 1990s. He tells NPR's Kelly McEvers that the 1998 film The Siege asked ""what would happen if terrorism came here? As it already had in, say, London and Paris, you know, how would we react if it happened in New York?""

Interview Highlights

On people's reactions to The Siege after the Sept. 11 attacks

It was the most rented movie in America after 9/11 ... I think there were two things — one was, it explained and looked at the problem of terrorism. But the other thing is, the movie has a happy ending, and after 9/11, people weren't sure how this movie was going to end.

On his piece about John O'Neill, ""The Counter-Terrorist""

If you recall, the planes were all grounded [after the attacks], and I lived in Austin, so I was unable to get to New York for several days, and I was desperate to get involved in this. I didn't know how to reduce this vast tragedy to a human scale. So I was combing through obituaries streaming online, and on this Washington Post site, I found O'Neill's obituary. And it made him out to be something of a disgrace. He had been the head of counterterrorism in New York, and he'd been washed out of the [FBI] because he'd taken classified information out of the office. And then he wound up getting a job as head of security at the World Trade Center.

You know, his job was to get Osama bin Laden, and instead bin Laden got him. And I thought at the time it was ironic. But I don't see it that way anymore. He took that job because he knew that al-Qaida would come and try to finish the job on the World Trade Center — they had bombed it once before in 1993 — so he instinctively put himself at ground zero ... it was O'Neill and a handful of people that really realized the peril that America was in.

On the Americans held captive and killed by the Islamic State, and what might have been done differently

I'm not saying that they might have been able to survive. Unless the American government had taken the same policy as the Europeans, which was simply to pay off the kidnappers. But the American government opposes that, and also at the time opposed any Americans, even the parents of these individuals, paying to ransom their child. So essentially, the parents were left by themselves. They had no idea how to deal with ISIS, and they got very little help from the State Department or the FBI ... there was rarely any moment when the FBI or the State Department shared information or offered to help in any meaningful way.

On the relevance of al-Qaida in the age of ISIS

Well, al-Qaida is the parent, with all the progeny that has multiplied all over the world. If you call it al-Qaida or bin Ladenism or jihadism, whatever you call it, it's proliferated. So yes, the mother organization has been reduced — it's not extinct, but it has certainly been confined. But the idea that they have put forward is alive in the world and spreading rapidly, unfortunately.

On how we've changed in America

Well, I was reflecting about how, when I was in high school, I took a date to Love Field in Dallas. That was actually the name of the airport, but it was where a lot of dates went when you didn't have any money. And I remember that we climbed into this airliner that had just come from some European place — we decided it must have been Paris — and we sat in the first class compartment, and the stewardesses, as you called them then, brought us a snack, and we pretended we were really cosmopolitan. And then we went up in the FAA tower, ""Come on in, kids!"" So we sat down and watched these airplanes land. And that was America.

And I'm so struck, just going into an office building where you have to be photographed. In Philadelphia, you go visit the Liberty Bell and you have to take off your shoes and your belt. These impingements on ordinary liberty — the kinds of things we took entirely for granted, those are gone. But if they're forgotten they'll be permanently gone. And I think that it's important that we keep in our minds the idea of that kind of freedom, and if we lose that, then I think terrorism really will have won."
None,http://ethics.npr.org/memos-from-memmott/when-were-asked-to-remove-a-photo-heres-what-we-do/,"When We’re Asked To Remove A Photo, Here’s What We Do",[],"[u'website', u'weve', u'kainaz', u'heres', u'image', u'request', u'remove', u'visuals', u'editor', u'team', u'trust', u'asked']","When We’re Asked To Remove A Photo, Here’s What We Do

Occasionally, someone in a photo we have posted asks that we remove the image from our website.

Any such request must be redirected to:

– Kainaz Amaria or another editor from the Visuals team.

– Chuck and/or Gerry Holmes, the deputy managing editors.

In most cases, the correspondent producer or staff photographer who took the image will already be aware of the request, as will the editor who handed the report. If not, they will be drawn into the discussion by Kainaz, Chuck and/or Gerry.

Others who will be brought in:

– Digital ME Scott Montgomery.

– Standards & Practices editor Mark Memmott.

The executive editor, VP for News and SVP for News will be looped in too.

The issue of whether to remove an image is a serious matter. As we’ve said before when discussing requests to take down stories, we agree with the AP that:

“We are guided by a newsroom policy that says it is inappropriate to remove content from our Website. If a report is inaccurate, we will correct it and state why it has been altered. If relevant new information emerges, we will update or do a follow-up story. “But our content is a matter of public record and is part of our contract with our audience. To simply remove it from the archive diminishes transparency and trust and, in effect, erases history. This is not a practice engaged in by credible news organizations or in line with ethical journalism.”

A key question that will be asked when such requests come in: What was the person told about how the photo or photos would be used?

It is important that people know we’re not doing stories that only go on the air. We spend time making sure they understand that the stories live on our website and that the photos we take will be there as well. And as we’ve said before:

“Kainaz Amaria from NPR’s visuals team says she has found ‘that the more transparent I am about my intentions with people in my story, the more they are willing to share their time and moments. It may sound counterintuitive, but in fact it’s been proven to me every time I step out of the office and into someone’s life. If people trust you, trust you are there to listen and learn, you’ll be surprised at the access they will offer you. … If people say, ‘Wait you are radio, why do you want my picture?’ I usually say something like, ‘Well, many of our stories go online to reach a wider audience and to get more eyeballs. Chances are if they see you, then they will connect with your story.’ ”

Kainaz and the Visuals team have considerable experience dealing with this issue. If a request comes in, they should take the lead. In most cases, it should be someone from Visuals who gets back to the person who wants a photo removed.

Note: If you're on mobile, we strongly recommend opening this video in the YouTube, Littlstar or Facebook apps.

YouTube

Since we started making Tiny Desk Concerts almost eight years ago, we've had more than 500 artists play the Tiny Desk, our own little makeshift concert venue right in the middle of NPR's offices in DC. From huge stars like Adele to T-Pain to up-and-comers like Car Seat Headrest and actual big bands like Mucca Pazza, all these musicians actually play behind MY desk — but I move out of the way when they set up.

This is one of the things that always surprises people when they visit NPR: that the Tiny Desk isn't a set. So we decided to give everyone a peek behind the scenes on a Monday afternoon earlier this month, when Wilco just happened to be stopping by.

We invited a company called RYOT to bring two 360-degree cameras to our offices and put them right in the front row of the audience. Then we filmed the whole thing, starting before Wilco even set up, before the staff flocked from all over the building to see the band play. Not only can you see the band up close, but if you look around, you'll see everything else that goes into making a Tiny Desk concert. You'll see our brilliant and calm engineer, Josh Rogosin. You'll see our lead videographer and producer of Tiny Desk Concerts, Niki Walker, along with her intern, Kara Frame. Then, of course, there's the crowd — what a lucky bunch. Many of them work here, many are lucky friends of people who work here. You'd probably recognize some of the voices in this radio crowd.

If you've never watched a 360-degree video before, we can help. There's lots to look around and spot — in fact, if you look really carefully, you might be able to find seven of Wilco's album covers around the desk and references to each one that we hid in the crowd. And of course, enjoy the song itself, one of Wilco's unforgettable tunes, ""Misunderstood"" from the 1996 album Being There. In front starting from the left you'll see Mikael Jorgensen playing the melodica, Nels Cline on that resonator guitar, Jeff Tweedy singing and strumming, John Stirratt playing guitar and singing strongly alongside Jeff and Pat Sansone on banjo and glockenspiel. In the back, holding it all together and sometimes tearing it apart, is drummer Glenn Kotche.

And when you're all done here, you can watch Wilco play all four of the songs they performed at this Tiny Desk concert. For those of us here at NPR, you can guess how boring the day seemed after this."

We ask an astronaut who has spent lots of time in outer space three questions about storage space. Originally broadcast June 27, 2015.

KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Once again, we're spending today blissfully ignoring reality and listening back to some of our favorite interviews.

KURTIS: Let's go back to better times, like 2015. In June of that year, we went to Houston to interview astronaut Suni Williams. Peter started by asking her about her early career ambitions.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SUNI WILLIAMS: Yeah, so I wanted to be a veterinarian and...

SAGAL: Whoa, you screwed that up.

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Yeah, I sort of went the wrong turn and actually didn't get into the universities that I wanted to do that and ended up under the influence or guidance of my older brother to go to the Naval Academy.

SAGAL: Wait a minute. You went to the U.S. Naval Academy as, like, a backup school?

WILLIAMS: Well, my brother said they like to camp and we camped when we were kids. And so he said I'd like it. And I did.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Really?

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

SAGAL: You went to the U.S. Naval Academy 'cause you like to go camping.

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

SAGAL: You know, they're generally on boats, the Navy.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, I missed that point, a little bit.

SAGAL: Really? OK.

WILLIAMS: So, I finished there and was trying to figure out what to do - at the end of that, we get to pick by our class standing. And I was not the top, not the end, somewhere in the middle. And I wanted to be a diver because I was a swimmer. I didn't get that billet but, at the same time, ""Top Gun"" came out so I thought I would be Tom Cruise and go fly airplanes. So, that was my goal.

SAGAL: Really?

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

POUNDSTONE: So we owe it to Tom Cruise that you're here with us?

SAGAL: Yeah.

WILLIAMS: I never thought about that way, but I guess so.

SAGAL: Hey, Tom.

POUNDSTONE: Yeah, thank you, Tom Cruise.

SAGAL: So, seriously did - you were like, OK, send me to Miramar I want to be a fighter pilot?

WILLIAMS: Yeah.

SAGAL: And what happened?

WILLIAMS: Well, I didn't get to do that.

SAGAL: Oh.

WILLIAMS: I flew helicopters, which actually is the second best view of the earth. The first best view is, I think, a little bit higher.

SAGAL: Right. So, now you're like - you're a helicopter pilot, flying combat helicopters – right? - off of aircraft carriers thinking, I wonder if it's too late for veterinary school, but hey.

WILLIAMS: I was. So I was sort of curious about how helicopters work because it was sort of a mystery to me. You know, you stick the key in or whatever, you raise the collective and the cyclic and you start to fly.

POUNDSTONE: Sure.

WILLIAMS: And like, how the heck does this thing work? So I wanted to learn how to figure that out so I went to test pilot school. And that's the first time I actually came down here to Johnson Space Center and met real astronauts and learned what they did and thought that would be pretty cool, too - almost cooler than Tom Cruise - so, what the heck?

SAGAL: This sounds very accidental.

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: That's life, yeah.

SAGAL: You know, I mean, a lot of people are like, well, I did this, and I did that, and I ended up in a trailer with three kids.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You ended up on the International Space Station, which you have been to how many times?

WILLIAMS: Two times.

SAGAL: Only twice?

WILLIAMS: Only twice.

SAGAL: Twice, OK.

WILLIAMS: But for long times each time.

SAGAL: But you still hold the record, I am told, for the longest spacewalk.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, well, the number of them.

SAGAL: Most number of spacewalks.

WILLIAMS: For women.

SAGAL: For women.

POUNDSTONE: So...

WILLIAMS: As my husband would say, not bad for a girl.

SAGAL: Not bad for a girl. And did you have to do so many 'cause you kept forgetting things outside?

WILLIAMS: I hope not.

SAGAL: No, it's like, oh, I left my keys outside, I got to...

(LAUGHTER)

ALONZO BODDEN: Did you ever get to do any experiments involving an animal and finally say I got this veterinary thing done?

WILLIAMS: Well, as a matter of fact, we had spiders - Egyptian jumping spiders - up there.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That sounds like a horror movie.

WILLIAMS: Yeah, they were scary, actually. They've got eight eyes on their heads.

POUNDSTONE: Ew.

WILLIAMS: And they do everything by sight. So, as soon as you look at their little container, they look up at you like this. It's a little nerve-racking.

SAGAL: So what - why did you...

POUNDSTONE: Yeah, what were they there for?

WILLIAMS: Actually, it was an experiment suggested by a kid who lives in Egypt, and he knows about these types of spiders and he wanted to see if they would adapt. Because they're like Spiderman - when they see their prey, they jump at it, and they sort of let their little string down and grab the thing and eat it. And so, in space you can't really jump...

SAGAL: That's just what Spiderman does.

WILLIAMS: Well, they figured it out but it took a little while. Initially they were a little bit frustrated and they were running around.

SAGAL: I just imagine these spiders going (yelling).

POUNDSTONE: So, what were they frustrated by? Their web didn't go where they wanted it to because of the - a lack of gravity?

WILLIAMS: Yeah, exactly. So they were trying to jump, but if you, like, jump in space, you're just going to jump up.

POUNDSTONE: Even if I were a spider, I'd be like wow!

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Exactly.

SAGAL: Does it ever get either claustrophobic or boring spending that much time in a big tube like that?

WILLIAMS: Absolutely not. There's just so many cool things to do. We're busy. When I was up on my first flight, we were really putting it together. So, I was essentially a construction worker. On the second flight, we were doing a lot of science experiments, and we've got a really cool window called the cupola. It's a big circular window with six panes around, sort of at angles so you can see the Earth, you can see the edge of the Earth, you can go out - look out into the universe. It's pretty spectacular.

POUNDSTONE: Do you think they might need a comic?

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Absolutely.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, man, that would be the greatest. You know, I don't even want to come back. You can just let me go.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: What do you do for entertainment?

WILLIAMS: So we try to keep it a normal day while we're up in space. You know, you don't want to change your time cycle too much, so we just keep it normal. And so about 5 or 6 o'clock at night, after we finish working, we knock it off by having prerecorded shows that we watch sometimes through the computer while we're eating dinner.

POUNDSTONE: Your first night in space, could you - how could you even sleep? What do you mean keep it normal?

JOBRANI: They're not going to take you if you're going to be like this.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Paula, you need to calm down. You need to be saying, that sounds great. Wow, I really have no problems with you at all.

POUNDSTONE: Yeah, yeah. Hey, let’s watch TV over dinner and go to bed early. What do you say?

SAGAL: Yeah, there you go.

WILLIAMS: It's not like we're going out anywhere.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, Suni, we have invited you here to play a game we're calling...

KURTIS: First Month Is Free.

SAGAL: You have spent a lot of time in outer space. So we thought we'd ask you three questions about storage space.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Answer two of these three questions about the wonderful, fascinating world of rental storage units, and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - Carl Kasell's voice. Bill, who is Suni playing for?

KURTIS: Wilson Chang of Houston, Texas.

SAGAL: There you go.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: He's out there somewhere. Here's your first question. As you probably know, people often bid for the contents of abandoned storage units, sight unseen. Well, one unit bought at auction near here in Houston turned out to contain what? A, a NASA space rocket, B, 20 years' worth of ZZ Top's beard trimmings; or C, 4,000 never-used Houston Oilers Super Bowl champion T-shirts.

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Ouch, ouch.

KURTIS: Never used.

WILLIAMS: Wow. Wow. C?

SAGAL: So you're going to go for C, the Houston Oilers Super Bowl champion T-shirts?

(APPLAUSE)

WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, C.

SAGAL: You are a hopeful crowd. No, it was actually the NASA space rocket.

WILLIAMS: Get out of here. What are we doing?

SAGAL: They found a Delta relay rocket from the '60s that had just been put in there and forgotten about.

WILLIAMS: Oh, God (laughter).

BODDEN: We really don't...

SAGAL: All right.

BODDEN: You guys don't keep track of those?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, next question. During an episode of the show ""Storage Hunters,"" the show's hosts opened up a storage locker to find that the previous owner had left what behind? A, comedian Dennis Miller, B, another storage locker containing another even smaller storage locker, or C, a swarm of angry bees that the previous owner had put there for safekeeping.

(LAUGHTER)

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Making buzzing sound).

WILLIAMS: You think so?

SAGAL: They're either buzzing or their applauding in a very strange, regional way.

WILLIAMS: C.

SAGAL: So you're going to go for the bees. Yes, it was the bees.

WILLIAMS: All right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: We don't know why…

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: We don’t know why the prior owner had decided to put a beehive in there, but the bees really didn't appreciate it based on their attitude when the door was opened. All right, last one. A man in North Carolina is being sued by the previous owner of a storage locker he purchased at auction. The previous owner says he may have given up the storage locker, but he wants his what back? A, his groove, B, his baby back, or C, his leg.

(LAUGHTER)

WILLIAMS: Going for C again.

SAGAL: Yes, it was his leg.

WILLIAMS: Yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: A man named John Wood was keeping his amputated leg in a barbecue smoker, as one does, so he could be buried with it someday, but the new owner realized the potential of having a human leg in a barbecue smoker and started charging adults three dollars and children just one dollar to look at it and didn't want to give the leg back.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Suni do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Suni proving why she's called Suni. She's a winner - two out of three.

SAGAL: Yes.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Suni Williams is a pilot and astronaut who has spent a total of 322 days in orbit on the International Space Station and one of the people who's paving the way for NASA's journey to Mars and beyond. Suni Williams, thank you so much for being on WAIT WAIT… DON'T TELL ME.

Paradise Lost by John Milton Paperback, 465 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

But sometimes, good doesn't win the day. Sometimes the bad guys get away with it.

And if we're going to talk about villains, let's talk about the biggest of the Big Bads, the Grand-daddy of Ghouls, the Imperator of Iniquity — Satan himself. Specifically, the version of Satan set down by John Milton in Paradise Lost.

Like a lot of kids, I first encountered Milton's Satan in high school English class. And luckily, my tenth grade English teacher Rhoda Trooboff still lives here in Washington, D.C., and is more than willing to talk Milton.

Satan doesn't just get away with it, she says, ""he brings his buddies into it. And together they form a community that sounds as they describe it, really exciting. I think that model of these really well-written villains are so compelling to the reader that they're, I hate to say it, more interesting than the good guys.""

Sure, he's been cast out of Heaven, but Satan pretty much has it made in Hell.

Milton's Satan is the ancestor of our modern antiheroes, the kinds of guys who flip the fire of damnation into a blaze of glory. But the more reading I did for this story, the more I noticed another kind of unpunished villain ... people like O'Brien, the terrifyingly calm Inner Party member in George Orwell's 1984.



""If you want a vision of the future, Winston, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever,"" O'Brien says, as he tortures protagonist Winston Smith into betraying his lover Julia.

Like death and taxes, O'Brien is inescapable. And like many successful villains, he truly believes in his cause. ""Those are the ones that tend to get away with it, because they don't get distracted,"" says fantasy author Victoria Schwab. I caught up with her at this year's San Diego Comic Con because she's kind of an expert on villains. A few years back, she set herself this challenge:

1984 by George Orwell Paperback, 328 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

""If I wrote an entire book that only had bad people, could I make you root for them as if they were the hero.""

Schwab points to villains like the nobly murderous serial killer Dexter, or the X-men's long-running antagonist — and sometimes ally — Magneto. (And yes, I know, Magneto ends up in prison a lot. But he keeps coming back).

""They have their own ethics, they have their own system, they have their own code that they're following. So even if it's not our code, the fact that they do have a code, that they're not anarchic, is something that readers and viewers find really appealing.""

And I think that's the real heart of the matter — the blackened, shriveled, eeeevil heart. Because after all, it's the readers who want to see the bad guy get his just desserts, and it's the author who dispenses the punishment.

So if you're a literary villain, here's some free advice — adopt a cause, practice your smoldering glances and your withering quips, because charming the audience is your key to getting away with it. Whatever IT happens to be."

There was a good discussion this week among correspondents and editors in the New York bureau about whether we can use some offensive language in podcasts that we can’t on the air.

The immediate question was this (NOTE: sensitive readers may find the next sentence objectionable):

Can we call an asshole an asshole?

The answer was “no,” we don’t want an NPR correspondent to say that on a podcast.

The process, by the way, worked. A correspondent consulted his editor. The editor consulted his boss and the Standards & Practices noodge. A case was made, consideration was given and a decision was reached that everyone understood.

This is a good time to ask: How do we feel about offensive language in podcasts?

As an organization, we respect our audience and “set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive.”

That line was originally written about what we say on the air, but we made clear three years ago when the Ethics Handbook was published that the bar applies to our other platforms as well:

“Online, if sound or text containing potentially offensive language has been approved for use by a Managing Editor or someone above that level, it too must be preceded by text (and in the case of audio, a verbal warning as well) advising the NPR.org audience that what follows contains language some may find offensive.”

The environment is changing quickly. Some very popular podcasts do not worry about whether their language might offend. Their hosts’ conversational and sometimes profane ways of speaking are probably pulling in far more listeners than they repel.

We don’t want to seem boring and out-of-step. We do want to sound like America. But, the bar that NPR journalists need to get over before using such language themselves has to be set incredibly high — so high, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to get over.

We’re professional communicators at a major news organization. What we say and write in public reflects on NPR. No matter what platform we’re using or where we’re appearing, we should live up to our own standards. Yes, there’s more room in podcasts to let guests speak freely and for our journalists to be looser with their language. But it doesn’t mean NPR correspondents are free to use words or phrases in podcasts that they would never use on the air.

We should always be the news outlet that revels in language. There are so many wonderful words. Use them!

The most common offensive words and phrases are among the least creative ways of expressing yourself. They’re akin to cliches in the sense that they’re easy ways out. We pride ourselves on using words that pop out because they’re funny, provocative, rarely heard or just perfect. Again, use them!

You may be asking: Who needs to sign off on what is permissible language in a podcast, what does and does not need to be bleeped and what kind of warnings need to be given to listeners? The people to consult are: the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott).

A California lawmaker's push to reduce discrimination against LGBT people at religious colleges and universities sparks new debate over the separation of church and state.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And now to the latest battle over religious liberty. It's in California, where anti-discrimination laws cover sexual orientation. Religious colleges and universities have had an exemption from the law. A state lawmaker wants that to change to protect LGBT students at those schools. That move would open these institutions up to lawsuits. Capital Public Radio's Ben Adler has more from Sacramento.

BEN ADLER, BYLINE: As a child, Anthony Villarreal knew he was different. His elementary school friends had girlfriends. He planned weddings. He was raised Catholic in a small town east of Fresno in California's Central Valley. He accepted an athletic scholarship to William Jessup University, a private Christian college near Sacramento. He enrolled in 2010.

ANTHONY VILLARREAL: I was conflicted. I was Christian. And I had an idea that I might be gay. But I was in denial.

ADLER: Villarreal only came out to a few people during his years at William Jessup. But in his final semester, something very public happened. A loud argument with his live-in boyfriend over whether he should come out led his neighbors to call the cops, and he was arrested for domestic violence. Soon after, the university dismissed him. Villarreal is convinced he was kicked out because he's gay. The university says it was for domestic violence.

VILLARREAL: In a sense, they ruined my life. They may not know it. They may not feel it, and they may deny it. But they changed the path of my life dramatically.

ADLER: Now, this example is an imperfect one. Villarreal was never charged with domestic violence, and there's no proof the university dismissed him for being gay. In fact, the university says it never discriminates against students based on sexual orientation. But Villarreal says many LGBT students at faith-based schools feel pressured to be someone they're not.

VILLARREAL: And this bill will make sure that no one has to go through what I had to go through.

ADLER: The bill he's talking about is a measure in the California Legislature authored by Democratic Senator Ricardo Lara.

RICARDO LARA: We're saying if there is discrimination and you can prove that in a court of law, people should be able to have damages for that.

ADLER: Religious colleges and universities can claim an exemption from federal and state anti-discrimination laws. In California, those laws cover sexual orientation. Lara wants to end that exemption under state law for any institution that receives public funding, including state financial aid. William Jessup's president, Dr. John Jackson, says Lara's proposal would force his school to change its faith-based policies, stop admitting students on state aid or be sued.

JOHN JACKSON: We do think it's ultimately a religiously discriminating bill. To our knowledge, there's never been a religious test for public benefits.

ADLER: Some California lawmakers agree. Here's Republican Assemblyman James Gallagher.

JAMES GALLAGHER: When we try to parse out what is religious and what we view should be the proper view, we're kind of imposing a secular view on that religious institution.

ADLER: That opposition led the bill's author to strip the liability provision. It now requires religious colleges and universities to notify current and future students and staff of the anti-discrimination exemption.

MARCI HAMILTON: This is really about the classical balance in the United States between religious liberty and the moral imperative not to harm others.

ADLER: Marci Hamilton is an expert on law and religion at the University of Pennsylvania. She says 21 states have Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, or RFRAs, where religious groups could try to overturn this scaled-back bill.

HAMILTON: But California is the only state where the disclosure is being introduced and there's no background RFRA. And so the religious groups are basically having to explain themselves to the legislature. So it's dramatically different politically.

ADLER: And the issue isn't going away. The bill's author says he'll try again next year to make religious colleges and universities liable for discrimination. For NPR News, I'm Ben Adler in Sacramento.

Back in 1972, John Lennon hired Leon Wildes, an immigration attorney who had no idea who he was.

Wildes' son, Michael, remembers his father coming home to tell his mother about their first meeting.

""And he said, 'A singer by the name of Jack Lemon and his wife Yoko Moto,' "" Michael recalls. ""My mom looked at him like he wasn't well. 'Are you talking about the Beatles and John Lennon?' My father said, 'Yeah!' ""

Over the next five years, Lennon and Ono were often caught on camera outside immigration court in New York City — as well as on late-night talk shows such as NBC's The Tomorrow Show With Tom Snyder.

""What is your status in the country right now?"" Snyder asked Lennon during a show taping in 1975.

Arizona Dreamers Five Years Later 6:32

""That's why Leon's here,"" Lennon answers. He glances over at Leon Wildes sitting across from him on a dark TV set. ""What, what am I, Leon?""

""Well, John was charged with being deportable in the U.S. for being an overstay,"" says Wildes, who has written a new book about Lennon's deportation case called John Lennon vs. The U.S.A.

In other words, Lennon was on a tourist visa that expired while he was helping his wife, Yoko Ono, with a custody battle over her daughter from a previous marriage.

So Wildes got that visa extended. But immigration officials gave them only just over month before Lennon would have to leave. Later, Wildes put in an application for a green card, which was denied.

But Lennon still wanted to stay in America.

""I like to be here because this is where the music came from,"" Lennon said. ""This is what influenced my whole life and got me where I am today.""

Wildes appealed the denial.

But FBI files show that the Nixon administration wanted Lennon, along with his anti-war activism and influence over young voters, out of the country.

So Wildes started digging for another route.

""I always had a feeling that the government must have a program to exercise some discretion,"" Wildes said.

Asked why he had that feeling, Wildes said it was ""because there were rumors of certain guys who were — had critical criminal backgrounds and bad immigration histories and seemed to be still around.""

Those guys probably benefited from what's now known as ""prosecutorial discretion."" It's based mainly on the premise that the federal government doesn't have enough resources to deport all of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

Under federal law, immigration officials can choose to prioritize certain deportation cases while holding off on other ones for humanitarian or political reasons.

The problem at the time was that Wildes didn't have proof that this kind of program existed until he filed a Freedom of Information Act request.

""When the box came into my office, there was jubilation!"" Wildes said. ""Unbelievable feeling that I had succeeded.""

In the end, Lennon received a green card, which allowed him to stay in the U.S. But those files led U.S. immigration officials to publicize a secret policy.

""Before the work of Mr. Wildes, deferred action was a complete mystery because there wasn't even a guideline for attorneys and noncitizens,"" says Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, who teaches immigration law at Penn State University and wrote Beyond Deportation: The Role of Prosecutorial Discretion in Immigration Cases.

The files showed that for decades, the government had shielded some immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from deportation because of their sympathetic cases. The Obama administration used that policy to create the original Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

""Eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization,"" said President Obama in a 2012 announcement.

An expansion of the program, as well as the creation of a similar program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, is currently on hold because of legal challenges.

But today, the original DACA program covers more than 700,000 young people brought to the U.S. as children — all in part because of that immigrant from Liverpool."

FARAI CHIDEYA, HOST:

The Hugo Awards are handed out each year for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. They've been awarded since 1955 in categories like best novel and best graphic story. Tonight, author Nnedi Okorafor is up for best novella for her story about a girl named Binti.

NNEDI OKORAFOR: (Reading) I powered up the transporter and said a silent prayer. I had no idea what I was going to do if it didn't work. My transporter was cheap, so even a droplet of moisture or more likely a grain of sand would cause it to short. It was faulty, and most of the time I had to restart it over and over before it worked. Please not now, please not now, I thought.

CHIDEYA: Well, that's one way to head off to college, at least for the title character, Binti. She's a teenager headed to the best university among worlds, some of which are at war with each other. Author Nnedi Okorafor joins us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. Welcome.

OKORAFOR: Thank you. Glad to be here.

CHIDEYA: So how did you come up with this character, who has many fascinating talents we'll get into, and this world?

OKORAFOR: It's interesting because a lot of my stories are often based on several things, but their foundation is in the stories of the women and girls around me and also within myself. And Binti comes from a very insular family - a cultural family that's very close. And she ends up picking up and going and leaving her family and going just so that she can go to a university that is on another planet.

And the way that that kind of came along was, for me at the time, I had decided to take a position at the University of Buffalo in New York. They were having a bit of a hard time with it, and it was a decision that I had made. And it was a very, very big decision, and eventually I had to just do it. I had to just go. The first few months I was there, that was when I wrote ""Binti,"" and I was kind of exploring my family's fears and a lot of their fears were logical. And I was exploring them, and I was thinking what if the fears that they had of me leaving and doing this really just kind of breaking from the family in this way - what if their fears came true? And that's where the plot of ""Binti"" came from.

CHIDEYA: And you're the American-born child of Igbo parents from Nigeria, and that ethnic group has tens of millions of people in the most populous country on the continent of Africa. So how has that heritage affected your world view?

OKORAFOR: I call myself Nigamerican (ph) as opposed to Nigerian-American because Nigamerican is one word. That's very much a part of my identity, and it's also very much a reason why I think I ended up writing science fiction and fantasy because I live on these borders - and these borders that allow me to see from multiple perspectives and kind of take things in and then kind of process certain ideas and certain stories in a very unique way. And that has led me to write this strange fiction that I write, which really isn't that strange if you really look at it through a sort of skewed lens.

CHIDEYA: And a lot of your work includes African characters and just a diverse cast of characters. The award for which you're nominated, the Hugo Award, has been rocked by controversy in recent years with a group of writers sometimes calling themselves the Sad Puppies or the Rabid Puppies, voting as a block against what they argue is boring, multicultural message fiction. Why do you think there's so much pushback against multicultural science fiction and speculative fiction?

OKORAFOR: When people see something that is new to them, you know, new or different or that's so new that they don't quite understand it and so therefore can't analyze it from an easy point of view, the result is often fear. And fear often manifests itself as anger and rage and hatred, and I think that's where a lot of this comes from.

I think that inevitably science fiction and fantasy was going to become more diverse, and I think that certain people kind of react negatively to that because they've been used to being in a certain position for so long. And they feel that they're being moved from the center and becoming less significant when really that is not what's happening at all. Things are just becoming bigger and more exciting, and they're included as well. So I think that it's fear of the unknown. I think these are the last throes of that shift. It's - these are growing pains.

CHIDEYA: How does it fit into your overall writer's mission, however you define that for yourself, to have books not only for adults but children that are in the speculative-fiction genre, you know, things like your ""Akata Witch"" series? Tell us a little bit about that story and also how it fits into your view of what science fiction and speculative fiction and fantasy are?

OKORAFOR: OK. I'll start with ""Akata Witch."" ""Akata Witch"" is a story that is about a Nigerian-American girl who goes back to Nigeria and is dealing with all of her cultural issues, and then one day she finds out she's part of this magical society. She meets friends, and there's a community. And then there's a magical world. Basically, her world just really opens up because it becomes more.

As far as my own mission, I wouldn't say that I have a mission. I know that I was writing these stories because, one, I enjoyed writing stories. Two, I had all of these stories to tell. Like, I'd look around at my relatives, and I listened. And I wasn't seeing these stories that I wanted to see being told. It's not so much a mission. It's just that I love stories, and so I write them and so I produce them.

CHIDEYA: Nnedi Okorafor is an award-winning author. Her book ""Binti"" is up for best novella at the Hugo Science Fiction Awards tonight. Thanks so much for joining us, Nnedi.

OKORAFOR: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Updated at 6 p.m. with judge's ruling

Usually when there's a question about who created a piece of art, the artist is dead and can't speak for himself — he can't say, ""Hey, I made that,"" or ""Nope, not mine."" But this is a story about a living artist who went to court to prove that a painting in fact is not his. And on Tuesday, a judge in Chicago agreed.

The painting in question is a desert landscape. There's blue sky at the top, red rocks and green cacti. It's owned by Robert Fletcher, a 62-year-old former corrections officer living in the Canadian city of Sault Ste. Marie. Here's how Fletcher says he got the painting: In 1976, he was working in Ontario's Thunder Bay Correctional Centre when he hit it off with an inmate named Peter Doige, who was in for LSD possession. Doige was going through some rough times, but he had this painting he had made in art class.

""I said, 'That painting you did inside, that desert scene, I absolutely love it,' "" Fletcher remembers. ""He said, 'Would you give me $100 for it?' "" Fletcher said yes.

A couple of decades later, a buddy of Fletcher's is over at his house and sees the painting. He tells Fletcher that it's by a famous artist — Peter Doig. They look him up online and Fletcher recognizes him. ""We watched some videos online of him being interviewed and the first thing I remember noticing is his body language — you know, some facial expressions and his use of his hands,"" Fletcher says.

Peter Doig is a pretty famous artist — last year, one of his paintings sold at auction for nearly $26 million. So Fletcher tried to sell his painting. That's when representatives for Doig came back and said the painting wasn't a Doig. Not only that, but Peter Doig doesn't know Robert Fletcher. And while he did do LSD in the '70s, Doig's representatives say he was never in jail.

For most people, that would be the end of it, but Fletcher and the owner of the gallery he hired to sell the painting were so convinced it was a Doig that they lawyered up and went to court.

Sergio Muñoz Sarmiento has worked in art law for over a decade. He says, ""It's odd in the sense that this is the first time that I'm aware of that an artist is being asked to testify that a work of art was not made by him. ... Even if you're alive, how do we say this is a work by you and this is not a work by you?""

Here's another complication: The signature on the painting in question spells the artist's last name Doige, with an e, but the famous artist spells his name with no e. And there was a Peter Doige in the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre in the 1970s. According to his sister, he was fond of art and music and liked to paint. Doige died in 2012.

After Tuesday's ruling, Doig's lawyer, Matthew Dontzin, released a statement that said, ""I have rarely seen such a flagrant example of unethical conduct in the U.S. courts nor a case that inflicted such needless burdens on a defendant. Artists should be grateful to Peter for having the ethical and financial fortitude to fight tirelessly to ensure that justice prevailed in today's verdict."""

Vevo

What makes a torch song a true showstopper? Great lines help, and Maren Morris' tearjerking ballad ""Once"" offers one right off the bat. ""Darling, we were too gone to stay,"" she sings in an alto that's as blue as two hours after midnight. ""Couldn't get through the night, so we had to call it a day."" The melody descends, perfectly matching the resignation in Morris' lyric. It's like when Adele intones, ""And you're married now"" in ""Someone Like You,"" or when Dionne Warwick utters ""What am I to do?"" after the big choral climax in ""Anyone Who Had a Heart."" To execute such a subtle turn, a song must be perfectly calibrated, and the vocalist must have total command of her instrument. Morris' signature ballad, offered here in a new live version recorded with her band at Nashville's historic RCA Studio A, shines with both qualities.

Morris has range. When the buzz started to build in Nashville about this young country music innovator, her songwriting captured people's imaginations. Then came her first smash hit, ""My Church,"" a gospelized country rocker that proved her traditionalist bona fides. When Morris's debut album, Hero, came out earlier this year, her love for the R&B sounds of Beyoncé and Rihanna sparkled in tracks like the reggae-ish ""Rich"" and the buoyant ""Just Another Thing."" Now she's claiming her space among the divas: In the video she wears a white ensemble à la Celine Dion, and is shown holding a lap dog before she takes the mic. (Divas and lap dogs: It's an endless romance.) Having released one of the most sonically adventurous country albums in recent memory, Morris continues to prove that she doesn't intend to stay within one musical zone — except that one labeled ""excellence.""

Hero is out now on Sony."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Karen Matthews/AP Karen Matthews/AP

The National Labor Relations Board ruled 3-1 Tuesday that graduate students working as teaching or research assistants at private universities are employees with the right to collective bargaining.

The decision comes in response to a petition filed by the Graduate Workers of Columbia-GWC and the United Autoworkers Union, which has been seeking to represent grad student assistants at Columbia University.

NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports that ""only a small fraction of graduate students at public universities are currently represented by unions — but the decision governing private university students is expected to lead to unionization efforts that could organize tens of thousands more.""

The NLRB had long held that students who teach or research at a private university were not employees covered under the National Labor Relations Act, Yuki reports. That changed in 2000, when the board decided a case in favor of students, and changed again with another ruling four years later. Now the NLRB has reversed itself yet again.

In Tuesday's decision, the board majority wrote that the 2004 ruling ""deprived an entire category of workers of the protections of the Act, without a convincing justification in either the statutory language or the policies of the Act without a convincing justification.""

In 2004, the NLRB reasoned that graduate assistants cannot be statutory employees because they ""are primarily students and have a primarily educational, not economic, relationship with their university."" The current board disagreed:

""The Board has the statutory authority to treat student assistants as statutory employees, where they perform work, at the direction of the university, for which they are compensated. Statutory coverage is permitted by virtue of an employment relationship; it is not foreclosed by the existence of some other, additional relationship that the Act does not reach.""

The decision was signed by NLRB Chairman Mark Gaston Pearce and members Kent Y. Hirozawa and Lauren McFerran.

In his dissent, member Philip A. Miscimarra argued that the relationship between Columbia University ""is primarily educational, and that student assistants are not employees."" He called the majority's decision ill-advised.

Columbia University issued this statement, which apparently leaves open the possibility that it will appeal the NLRB decision in federal court:"

Our panelists tell three stories about someone being loved a little too much, only one of which is true.

BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We are playing this week with Adam Felber, Paula Poundstone and Alonzo Bodden. And here, again, is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in downtown Chicago, Peter Sagal.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Now it is time for the WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME Bluff the Listener game. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to play our game on the air. Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

DELIA LIUZZA: Hi, this is Delia Liuzza calling from Greenville, N.C.

SAGAL: Oh, how are things in Greenville?

LIUZZA: Hot, wet.

SAGAL: Yes, pretty much everywhere - humid. I see. What do you do there?

LIUZZA: Yeah. I'm a sign language interpreter.

SAGAL: You're a sign language interpreter. That is noble and good work.

(APPLAUSE)

LIUZZA: Well, thank you.

SAGAL: And how did you get into that?

LIUZZA: Actually, I met my husband, who's deaf, at a bar, and he couldn't speak my language, so I learned his.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: All right. Wait a minute. I actually - first of all, that's wonderful and charming and romantic.

LIUZZA: It was noble.

SAGAL: But I'm very curious. You meet him at a bar. How - what does a deaf person use for a pick up line? Or what do you use as a pick up line for a deaf guy?

LIUZZA: (Laughter) Well, there were lots of, you know, sultry glances, and he tried to trip me with his pool stick.

SAGAL: Oh.

ADAM FELBER: Oh, the direct approach.

SAGAL: So you were in the eighth grade when you met, I guess.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, welcome to the show, Delia. You're going to play our game in which you must tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is Delia's topic?

KURTIS: Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is getting a little annoying.

SAGAL: We always talk about love like it's a good thing. But this week, we heard a story about somebody being loved maybe a little bit too much.

LIUZZA: Oh, my.

SAGAL: Our panelists are going to tell you about it. Pick the real one, you'll win our prize, Carl Kasell's voice on your voice mail. Are you ready to play?

LIUZZA: I am ready.

SAGAL: First, let's hear a love story from Alonzo Bodden.

SAGAL: ""You Only Live Twice"" - the title of the Bond film could also be the title of Leroy Black's life. The evidence is two obituaries for Leroy Blast Black printed back-to-back in the Atlantic City Press, one from his wife and the second from his girlfriend. At least his wife got top billing.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The first one mentions his loving wife, Bearetta, and his son Jazz. The second mentions his long-time girlfriend, Princess Hall, and also his son Jazz. Princess mentioned other family members and a host of friends, but not Mrs. Black, and Mrs. Black made no mention of Princess. That host of friends may be thinking now that they know how he got the nickname Blast. Or they may just be wondering if lung cancer killed him or was it the meeting of these two women?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: One man, one wife, one girlfriend, two obits. Your next story of love and consequences comes from Paula Poundstone.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: Tad Spiller (ph) was so in love with Carla Walsh (ph), she was all he could think about. The way she looked in the morning, the way she looked in the afternoon, the way she sighed, her passion. Carla, Carla, Carla. She was from Boston. She couldn't even pronounce her own name. (Imitating Boston accent) Carla, Carla, Carla. How he loved her. He loved her so much he had Carla tattooed across his chest in large block letters. The problem with tattoos, he found out, is that they are permanent. The problem with love, he sadly discovered, is that it often isn't. They broke up.

He was surprised how quickly his love for Carla vanished and vexed by how his tattoo didn't. Even atop a fine six-pack, a chest that screamed Carla wouldn't be a turn on to a Deb, Jaffa or Katie. For a while, he settled for going slowly with women with other names during the winter. He thought he saw a future with a woman named Carol, but when he went to Dr. Tat-Off to get an estimate on the edit, he was told there might be scarring. At last count, he had gained 15 pounds from spending hours hanging out at a Starbucks hoping to hear a barista call out - Carla.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: A man who loved not wisely and got a tattoo that was a little too large and too permanent. Your next story of too much love comes from Adam Felber.

FELBER: Twelve-time Olympic medalist Ryan Lochte received more than his sixth gold medal this week. He also received some odd news about his wife, Kayla. It turns out that the woman who he's so compatible with, who somehow knew everything he wanted before he even had to ask for it, got that way by spending nearly eight years as his stalker.

It started when a friend sent him a photo from the 2008 Beijing Olympics, shortly after the medal ceremony for the men's 200-meter backstroke. The friend had circled a face in the crowd behind Lochte and wrote, hey, isn't that Kayla? Lochte thought that was impossible. He and Kayla didn't meet until five years later, and the model always said she wasn't interested in swimming. But some quick research showed Kayla in the crowd at virtually every swim meet and public appearance Lochte has attended since 2008.

Confronted with all this, Kayla confessed, yes, she'd followed Lochte around for years, even renting an apartment across the street from him complete with a creepy Lochte shrine and a telescope so she could learn absolutely everything about him. Surprisingly, Lochte says he isn't creeped out at all by it. Quote, ""she's like me. She sees what she wants, and she goes for it. And you got to admit, if stalking were an Olympic event, she would totally win the gold.""

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: All right. Here are three stories of maybe too much love in a person's life. From Alonzo Bodden, a man who died, leaving behind a bereaved wife and girlfriend, both of whom insisted on placing obituaries next to each other in the paper. From Paula Poundstone, a man who loved Carla so much, the tattoo of her name remained after she left, leaving him with a problem of dating only Carlas. And from Adam Felber, how Ryan Lochte, the Olympic swimmer, ended up marrying his own stalker without knowing it. Which one of these is a real story we saw in the week's news?

LIUZZA: Wow. Well, with the Olympics going on, that would seem to be the most obvious one. But somehow Alonzo just has the most honest voice, so I'm going to go with that.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: No, what really was it?

POUNDSTONE: (Laughter).

SAGAL: You chose, then, Alonzo's story of the man who left behind a wife and a girlfriend, both of whom wanted to lead the mourning. Well, to bring you the correct answer, we spoke to someone familiar with this real story.

BRIAN HICKEY: These are two separate obituaries, and one was one the wife wanted and one was what the long-time girlfriend wanted. They couldn't agree on the obituary.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: That was Brian Hickey. He first wrote about the double obituaries for the PhillyVoice. Congratulations, Delia.

LIUZZA: Thank you.

SAGAL: You got it right. Well done. Congratulations.

ALONZO BODDEN: Thank you for believing in me.

SAGAL: A point for Alonzo.

LIUZZA: (Laughter) You bet.

SAGAL: You've won our prize. Carl Kasell will record the greeting on your voice mail. Thank you so much for playing, Delia. All right.

LIUZZA: Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

SAGAL: Bye-bye.

The Terror Years From Al-Qaeda to the Islamic State by Lawrence Wright Hardcover, 366 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Author Lawrence Wright was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, which meant he was required to do two years of what was called ""alternative service."" He ended up in Egypt, teaching at the American University in Cairo. And it was there that the man from Texas started his obsession with the Middle East.

Since then, Wright has written a lot about the region and about terrorism as a staff writer for The New Yorker. Now, he has compiled his many New Yorker essays into a new book called The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State.

But his interest in terrorism stretches back to well before his New Yorker job ... back to a screenwriting gig in the 1990s. He tells NPR's Kelly McEvers that the 1998 film The Siege asked ""what would happen if terrorism came here? As it already had in, say, London and Paris, you know, how would we react if it happened in New York?""

Interview Highlights

On people's reactions to The Siege after the Sept. 11 attacks

It was the most rented movie in America after 9/11 ... I think there were two things — one was, it explained and looked at the problem of terrorism. But the other thing is, the movie has a happy ending, and after 9/11, people weren't sure how this movie was going to end.

On his piece about John O'Neill, ""The Counter-Terrorist""

If you recall, the planes were all grounded [after the attacks], and I lived in Austin, so I was unable to get to New York for several days, and I was desperate to get involved in this. I didn't know how to reduce this vast tragedy to a human scale. So I was combing through obituaries streaming online, and on this Washington Post site, I found O'Neill's obituary. And it made him out to be something of a disgrace. He had been the head of counterterrorism in New York, and he'd been washed out of the [FBI] because he'd taken classified information out of the office. And then he wound up getting a job as head of security at the World Trade Center.

You know, his job was to get Osama bin Laden, and instead bin Laden got him. And I thought at the time it was ironic. But I don't see it that way anymore. He took that job because he knew that al-Qaida would come and try to finish the job on the World Trade Center — they had bombed it once before in 1993 — so he instinctively put himself at ground zero ... it was O'Neill and a handful of people that really realized the peril that America was in.

On the Americans held captive and killed by the Islamic State, and what might have been done differently

I'm not saying that they might have been able to survive. Unless the American government had taken the same policy as the Europeans, which was simply to pay off the kidnappers. But the American government opposes that, and also at the time opposed any Americans, even the parents of these individuals, paying to ransom their child. So essentially, the parents were left by themselves. They had no idea how to deal with ISIS, and they got very little help from the State Department or the FBI ... there was rarely any moment when the FBI or the State Department shared information or offered to help in any meaningful way.

On the relevance of al-Qaida in the age of ISIS

Well, al-Qaida is the parent, with all the progeny that has multiplied all over the world. If you call it al-Qaida or bin Ladenism or jihadism, whatever you call it, it's proliferated. So yes, the mother organization has been reduced — it's not extinct, but it has certainly been confined. But the idea that they have put forward is alive in the world and spreading rapidly, unfortunately.

On how we've changed in America

Well, I was reflecting about how, when I was in high school, I took a date to Love Field in Dallas. That was actually the name of the airport, but it was where a lot of dates went when you didn't have any money. And I remember that we climbed into this airliner that had just come from some European place — we decided it must have been Paris — and we sat in the first class compartment, and the stewardesses, as you called them then, brought us a snack, and we pretended we were really cosmopolitan. And then we went up in the FAA tower, ""Come on in, kids!"" So we sat down and watched these airplanes land. And that was America.

And I'm so struck, just going into an office building where you have to be photographed. In Philadelphia, you go visit the Liberty Bell and you have to take off your shoes and your belt. These impingements on ordinary liberty — the kinds of things we took entirely for granted, those are gone. But if they're forgotten they'll be permanently gone. And I think that it's important that we keep in our minds the idea of that kind of freedom, and if we lose that, then I think terrorism really will have won."

The world has frozen over in the movie Snowpiercer. Set after a climate change disaster, all the action happens aboard a train that has to keep circling the globe for its passengers to stay alive.

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great train tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

The movie itself is uniquely international: Snowpiercer is based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette. It's directed by a Korean auteur and stars Hollywood A-listers including Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris. The movie opened in South Korea last summer. Since then it has played all over the world, and certain Americans have been wildly impatient for Snowpiercer to open here.

What kinds of Americans, you ask? Well, film nerds, science fiction nerds, Tilda Swinton nerds and fans of director Bong Joon-ho.

Grady Hendrix, who co-runs the New York Asian Film Festival, says Bong's movies, such as 2003's Memories of Murder, masterfully subvert genres. ""His serial killer movie was actually an amazing movie about Korean history but also delivered the thrills you want in a serial killer movie,"" he explains.

And Bong's 2006 movie The Host was both a sly critique of American intervention in Korea dating back to the Korean War — and about a giant monster eating people. The Host smashed South Korean box office records and became an international sensation.

So it was hardly a surprise when the director's next big action film — Snowpiercer — was immediately snapped up by Hollywood distributors Bob and Harvey Weinstein.

""Uncle Harvey. We had a long process,"" Bong wryly remembers during an interview at NPR West in Culver City.

Snowpiercer's U.S. release was delayed for months as Bong and Weinstein — known in the film world as Harvey Scissorhands — wrangled over Weinstein's insistence over cutting 20 minutes from the two-hour film and adding a voice-over. Bong adamantly refused. The international film community rallied behind Bong Joon-ho. Eventually, the Weinsteins agreed to release Snowpiercer intact.

""Their idea to simplify was a very silly one,"" Hendrix observes. ""The movie is incredibly simple. It is a train. The poor people live in the back. The rich people live in the front. And the poor people in back want to get to the front.""

Bong says an oppressed underclass rebelling against huge wealth gaps is not exactly science fiction right now. ""[It's] similar to Occupy Wall Street in terms of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent,"" he says. ""That's something that happens in other countries and also in Korea.""

The film has been getting rave reviews, partly because of Bong's knack for keeping viewers off balance. Take a meditative, dreamlike scene where the freedom fighters pause for a snack in a train car that's also an aquarium and a sushi counter. (Of course, sushi is sort of shorthand for the preferred food of the 1 percent.)

It's really about having fun with the audience. People go to the movies with certain genre conventions in mind. They go to the movies to have certain expectations met. It's always fun to play around with those expectation

""Outside the window, you can see the frozen ocean, where the fish inside the tanks used to swim,"" Bong says.

Before the ocean was ruined — partly to make this food. Such pointed, ironic juxtapositions are Bong's stock in trade.

""It's really about having fun with the audience,"" he explains. ""People go to the movies with certain genre conventions in mind. They go to the movies to have certain expectations met. It's always fun to play around with those expectations, to deliver what they came to see, but also give them things they didn't expect.""

Like a message about income inequality or environmental cataclysm — in a high-octane summer action flick. That's what Bong delivers — along with violence, explosions and special effects."

Words such as “we,” “our” and “us” are sometimes being used in ways that they shouldn’t.

It isn’t appropriate, for example, to be discussing U.S. policy about a particular conflict and say “we” support one side over another. We — that is, NPR — report about such policies. We don’t make them or endorse them.

A news report isn’t the right place to say that “our” civil rights have been violated by the government. That’s language for an op-ed.

The Ethics Handbook offers this guidance:

“Strive to use words and phrases that accurately deliver information without taking sides on emotional or political issues.”

“We,” “our” and “us” can create the impression that a reporter has taken sides.

In some cases, the right substitute is as simple as “Americans” or “taxpayers.” Other times, it might be a couple words, such as “U.S. forces” or “the administration.”

Remember, “there’s no cheering in the press box.”

As Stanford undergrads get ready for the fall semester, the university's administrators have issued a new mandate: Pack your books and calculators, but leave the fifths and handles at home.

On Monday, just over a month before classes resume, the university announced a set of changes to its alcohol policy.

Hard liquor will now be completely banned from on-campus parties — unless the party is hosted by groups exclusively for graduate students, and in that case, only mixed drinks are allowed. ""Straight shots of hard alcohol are never allowed at any party,"" the school says.

Beer and wine are still allowed.

And in dorms, individual students (provided they're 21 and over) will be allowed to have liquor — but only in bottles smaller than 750 mL.

Violating the policy could prompt ""administrative action"" and could result in people being kicked out of on-campus housing.

In its statement, Stanford called this ""a sensible, creative solution that has roots in research-based solutions."" Administrators say they are aiming not to prohibit alcohol, but to limit high-risk behavior, specifically. They believe limiting bottle sizes will have that effect:

""Most alcohol retailers only sell large-volume containers — 750 mL and above. Only select retailers sell hard alcohol containers smaller in volume than 750 mL. Therefore, the outlet density of establishments that sell hard alcohol around campus will be greatly reduced. Also, the costs associated with purchasing smaller containers of hard alcohol are higher than the cost per volume of larger containers, which may serve as a deterrent.""

Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin tells NPR that her office is not aware of any other college that has instituted a bottle-size limit on hard alcohol.

But Stanford is far from the first school to restrict liquor on campus. Bowdoin, Bates, Colby and Notre Dame have all had bans in place for more than six years.

Dartmouth banned hard liquor entirely at the beginning of 2015, while the University of Virginia established rules limiting hard liquor at large Greek parties to events with a hired bartender.

Both Dartmouth and U.Va. announced their policy changes in the wake of high-profile sexual assault allegations.

Stanford's policy change comes just a few months after former Stanford student Brock Allen Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.

During the case, Turner blamed his behavior on drinking. ""I made a mistake, I drank too much, and my decision hurt someone ... my poor decision making and excessive drinking hurt someone that night,"" he said in a statement. ""I've been shattered by the party culture and risk taking behavior that I briefly experienced in my four months at school.""

In a letter that went viral, the woman Turner assaulted repeatedly pointed out that drinking was not Turner's crime: It was assault.

""You were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing,"" she said, before graphically describing the assault. ""Why am I still explaining this.""

""You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone?"" she said.

On Twitter, two Stanford professors expressed frustration with the announcement of the alcohol policy change, specifically that it was announced in the wake of sexual assaults but addresses drinking instead of consent.

Lapin, the campus spokeswoman, says the concern over high-risk drinking at Stanford goes back ""many months."" She pointed to a letter from the president and provost in March that mentions alcohol poisoning and academic problems, as well as sexual assault, as reasons for the college's concern over alcohol misuse.

Meanwhile, the judge who gained infamy in the Brock Turner case has made headlines again.

Aaron Persky recused himself from a different sex-related case, in which he was due to decide whether to reduce a felony conviction for possession of child pornography to a misdemeanor.

The judge, who was subjected to a recall campaign after the Turner case, cited ""publicity surrounding the case"" that ""resulted in a personal family situation"" in stepping down from the child porn decision, The Mercury News reports."

Enough time has gone by and so many stories have been reported that it’s been decided we no longer need to always use words such as “self-declared,” “self-proclaimed” or “self-styled” with first references to the “Islamic State.”

Also, we believe the audience is familiar enough with that group to allow us to say “ISIS” on first reference.

Please note that we are not issuing a rule that it must be “ISIS” on first reference. Also, “self-declared Islamic State” (or some variation) on first reference is not being banned. The change being made is that we’re no longer saying the first reference has to be done a certain way.

It will still make sense in many cases to remind listeners and readers that ISIS is “the group known as the Islamic State” or some other formulation that spells out exactly what and who we’re referring to. Also, we’ll still have to deal with officials and guests who want to call it “ISIL” or “Daesh,” which will require us to throw in an “also known as.”

This note mostly supersedes our previous guidance. There’s a “mostly” in that sentence because the guidance about not using “so-called” remains in effect.

Early mornings are routine for 69-year-old Hiroyuko Yamamoto. He's typically at a busy intersection in the city of Matsudo, near Tokyo, where he volunteers as a school crossing guard. But one rainy morning a little over a year ago, an old woman caught his attention.

She was pushing a bicycle. She was kind of disheveled. Despite the rain, she didn't have an umbrella. When Yamamoto spoke to the woman, she said she was trying to get to the city of Kamisuwa. That's about four hours away by train.

Yamamoto recognized that the woman had several signs of dementia he'd learned about when he took his city's dementia awareness training.

Yamamoto volunteers with Matsudo's Orange Patrol. The organization's formal name in Japanese — Olenji koe kake tai — translates awkwardly into English as ""Troop that calls out to the elderly."" But the name accurately describes what the members do. Yamamoto says that just a simple, ""Hello, what a nice day,"" can tell you if someone is OK or needs help.

Because of his training, Yamamoto says, he knew how to talk with the old woman pushing the bicycle.

""I talked to her about things that, according to the training manual, would not upset her,"" he says. ""And I spoke in a gentle manner."" These things helped him persuade the woman to stay with him until the police arrived about 20 minutes later.

If it hadn't been for her chance encounter with Yamamoto, the woman might have gone missing, or worse. Last year, 12,208 people with dementia were reported missing to the National Police Agency in Japan. Most were found alive within a week. But 479 were found dead, and 150 were never found.

These numbers have been increasing every year as the number of older people in Japan continues to rise. Nearly 27 percent of the Japanese population is now 65 or older. And, as the number of older people grows, so does the number of people with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. The Japanese government expects that by 2025 more than 7 million of the nation's residents will have dementia.

A comprehensive plan for dealing with that expected rise in dementia cases was passed by the national government last year. But Matsudo has been providing dementia awareness training for city residents since 2010. Thousands of people have taken it.

Atsuko Yoshioka conducts dementia awareness classes for the city of Matsudo. She says the sessions are brief — just 60 to 90 minutes — so she tries to customize the content for students.

For example, pharmacist Takayuki Yoshida says he sometimes had clients who ""even after I gave the medication to them, they'd come back and say they didn't get the drugs."" Now he knows that may be a sign of dementia, and he contacts the patient's doctor.

Many post office workers have also taken the training. In Japan, post offices also conduct some banking transactions. Hiroki Yaita says sometimes an older client will come in several times to say that someone has stolen their bankbook. Now, because of the training, ""we would think that maybe that person has dementia and we would talk to the family about that possibility.""

The purpose of the training isn't to make Matsudo residents experts in dementia, says Tadashi Watanabe, chief of the city's Welfare and Longevity Department. The goal, he says, is just ""to support those with dementia, as well as their families, and make this a town where it's more comfortable for them to live.""

Some communities in the United States have begun similar programs. And in Japan what's been going on in Matsudo is now national policy. The comprehensive plan adopted by the government last year includes research and prevention and nursing services. It also includes a campaign for increasing dementia awareness among the general public. The country is on track to train 8 million people by the end of the next fiscal year.

Hidenori Kawashima, deputy director for dementia policy in Japan's Ministry of Labor, Health, and Welfare, says the expected rise in dementia cases should not be seen as a threat. Interacting with people with dementia will become normal.

""It would be a familiar thing,"" says Kawashima. ""So we wanted the plan: First, to create a structure in the local communities to support those with dementia and, second, to create a society where it will be natural for them to live.""

No government plan can keep people with dementia from wandering. But health officials in Japan hope there eventually will be entire communities prepared to help keep them safe, if and when they do."

“Korva said she would tell her driver, Pat, to start warming the car at 3:07 a.m. each day instead of 3:05 just as soon as she returns from the organic smoothie shop.”

Who’s at the organic smoothie shop? Pat or Korva? Who’s the “she?” When will she get back with that smoothie?

We offer this presumably fictional and rather convoluted sentence because many of us aren’t careful about making sure that the pronouns we use are clearly connected to the antecedents they replace. Editors see antecedent/pronoun problems in copy every day.

Let’s pick apart the opening scene. This is what was happening:

– Korva wanted the car started at 3:07 a.m., not 3:05.

– Pat was at the organic smoothie shop getting Korva’s Mango/Kale/Chia Supreme.

– Korva would have to wait until Pat returned to tell her about the new starting time.

Strunk and White’s The Elements of Style offers this advice: “The relative pronoun should come, in most instances, immediately after its antecedent.” Note, for instance, how much clearer it reads to say Korva would have to “wait until Pat returned to tell her.” Just four small words separate the antecedent from the pronoun. It’s clear that Pat is “her.”

Please also take care to pair singular pronouns with singular antecedents and plurals with plurals. Gender agreement is important as well, but bear in mind that the choice of pronoun may be a sensitive issue when the subject is a transgender person.

When Sadie Dupuis moved to Philly earlier this year, she returned to the creative headspace where Speedy Ortiz originally began: making music in a bedroom. Slugger is Dupuis' debut solo album under the Sad13 moniker, with playful, empowered and intimate pop songs that don't stray far from the weirdly liberating confines of a tiny room.

Featuring sugary synths and 8-bit drum beats, Sad13's first single ""Get A Yes"" doesn't have any of Speedy Ortiz's gnarly guitar work. This is a bedroom-pop song that grew up on the ear-popping production of '90s R&B and Courtney Love's raw sense of melody, but its woozy glitter roll is unmistakably Dupuis. But, in keeping with the band's determination to make safe spaces for its fans, Sad13 really wants to think about how we present something as intimate as consensual sex to her audience.

""How many kids learn about sex from pop music? And how many fun-sounding pop musicians do a heinous job as sex-ed teachers?"" Dupuis asks NPR. ""Like 'Genie In A Bottle,' which characterizes sex as an internal conflict between the mind and the body — rather than something you should only do when the minds and bodies of all parties involved are synchronized? Or 'Blurred Lines,' in which the narrator presumes to know what his partner wants?""

""Get A Yes"" makes consent sexy in how Dupuis normalizes — even renders tantalizing — the moment before (or even thinking about) getting it on, giving mutual desire real weight: ""I say yes to the dress when I put it on / I say yes if I want you to take it off / I say yes for your touch when I need your touch / I say yes if I want to.""

""You can only get to that affirmative yes through a lot of dialoguing, and I think that process should be viewed as fun, sexy and not at all daunting,"" Dupuis continues. ""So I wanted to make a pop song that explores the excitement inherent in getting and giving consent. And that's why I wrote 'Get A Yes.'""

Slugger comes out Nov. 11 on Carpark and iTunes."

The Terror Years From Al-Qaeda to the Islamic State by Lawrence Wright Hardcover, 366 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Author Lawrence Wright was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, which meant he was required to do two years of what was called ""alternative service."" He ended up in Egypt, teaching at the American University in Cairo. And it was there that the man from Texas started his obsession with the Middle East.

Since then, Wright has written a lot about the region and about terrorism as a staff writer for The New Yorker. Now, he has compiled his many New Yorker essays into a new book called The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State.

But his interest in terrorism stretches back to well before his New Yorker job ... back to a screenwriting gig in the 1990s. He tells NPR's Kelly McEvers that the 1998 film The Siege asked ""what would happen if terrorism came here? As it already had in, say, London and Paris, you know, how would we react if it happened in New York?""

Interview Highlights

On people's reactions to The Siege after the Sept. 11 attacks

It was the most rented movie in America after 9/11 ... I think there were two things — one was, it explained and looked at the problem of terrorism. But the other thing is, the movie has a happy ending, and after 9/11, people weren't sure how this movie was going to end.

On his piece about John O'Neill, ""The Counter-Terrorist""

If you recall, the planes were all grounded [after the attacks], and I lived in Austin, so I was unable to get to New York for several days, and I was desperate to get involved in this. I didn't know how to reduce this vast tragedy to a human scale. So I was combing through obituaries streaming online, and on this Washington Post site, I found O'Neill's obituary. And it made him out to be something of a disgrace. He had been the head of counterterrorism in New York, and he'd been washed out of the [FBI] because he'd taken classified information out of the office. And then he wound up getting a job as head of security at the World Trade Center.

You know, his job was to get Osama bin Laden, and instead bin Laden got him. And I thought at the time it was ironic. But I don't see it that way anymore. He took that job because he knew that al-Qaida would come and try to finish the job on the World Trade Center — they had bombed it once before in 1993 — so he instinctively put himself at ground zero ... it was O'Neill and a handful of people that really realized the peril that America was in.

On the Americans held captive and killed by the Islamic State, and what might have been done differently

I'm not saying that they might have been able to survive. Unless the American government had taken the same policy as the Europeans, which was simply to pay off the kidnappers. But the American government opposes that, and also at the time opposed any Americans, even the parents of these individuals, paying to ransom their child. So essentially, the parents were left by themselves. They had no idea how to deal with ISIS, and they got very little help from the State Department or the FBI ... there was rarely any moment when the FBI or the State Department shared information or offered to help in any meaningful way.

On the relevance of al-Qaida in the age of ISIS

Well, al-Qaida is the parent, with all the progeny that has multiplied all over the world. If you call it al-Qaida or bin Ladenism or jihadism, whatever you call it, it's proliferated. So yes, the mother organization has been reduced — it's not extinct, but it has certainly been confined. But the idea that they have put forward is alive in the world and spreading rapidly, unfortunately.

On how we've changed in America

Well, I was reflecting about how, when I was in high school, I took a date to Love Field in Dallas. That was actually the name of the airport, but it was where a lot of dates went when you didn't have any money. And I remember that we climbed into this airliner that had just come from some European place — we decided it must have been Paris — and we sat in the first class compartment, and the stewardesses, as you called them then, brought us a snack, and we pretended we were really cosmopolitan. And then we went up in the FAA tower, ""Come on in, kids!"" So we sat down and watched these airplanes land. And that was America.

And I'm so struck, just going into an office building where you have to be photographed. In Philadelphia, you go visit the Liberty Bell and you have to take off your shoes and your belt. These impingements on ordinary liberty — the kinds of things we took entirely for granted, those are gone. But if they're forgotten they'll be permanently gone. And I think that it's important that we keep in our minds the idea of that kind of freedom, and if we lose that, then I think terrorism really will have won."

The Voynich Manuscript is a singular mystery. But thanks to a small publishing house in Spain, the one-of-a-kind text will soon be more like one-in-900.

The 15th-century document is written in an unknown, apparently encrypted language that has defied every code breaker's efforts. It's illustrated with unknown or imaginary plants and never-seen constellations. The only copy is locked away at Yale University to protect the book; scans online are the closest most mortals can get to viewing its pages.

The Spanish publishing house Siloe specializes in replicas — very small runs of carefully re-created manuscripts, such as the 16th-century Bestiary of John of Austria and 10th-century Beato Emilianense. For 10 years, Siloe appealed to the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale, asking for access to the Voynich, Agence France-Presse reports.

The library — which tightly controls who can view the original, in order to protect it — granted permission for Siloe to examine the book, AFP writes. Now the publishing house is in the process of re-creating the volume — ""every stain, hole, sewn-up tear in the parchment,"" the news service says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cesar Manso/AFP/Getty Images Cesar Manso/AFP/Getty Images

Siloe will release 898 volumes (their standard, palindromic publishing run) and sell them for 7,000 to 8,000 euros, or about $8,000 to $9,000, AFP reports. Nearly 300 people have put in preorders.

In an annual bulletin, Juanjo Garcia and Pablo Molinero of Siloe said in Spanish that they were proud to have been chosen for the ""fabulous adventure"" of replicating the Voynich.

""What mysteries are hidden behind this monumental enigma?"" they asked, wondering who was ""the genius or the sadist"" who created the book.

Maybe a few hundred precise copies of the book will help the world's code breakers answer those questions. But don't bet on it: Countless cryptographers — including some of the world's most brilliant code breakers — have dedicated themselves to trying to solve the puzzle.

High-resolution scans and active Internet-enabled collaboration have not led to any big breakthroughs.

Writer Reed Johnson spent three years of his life as a Voynich obsessive. He spoke to NPR in 2013 about the enticing mysteries of the book, named after the Polish-American book dealer who bought it in 1912.

"" 'It doesn't match any other language that's been seen in any other book,' Johnson tells Rachel Martin, host of Weekend Edition Sunday. ""The drawings often have labels, which would seem to offer a route to deciphering the code. But that hope has proved to be an illusion, he says. ... "" 'The history of this manuscript is littered with ... all these people who have spent years and years trying to decipher this manuscript,' Johnson says.""

In fact, over all the decades of dedicated pursuit, there's only one documented success story.

""The only person to have made any headway is Indiana Jones,"" the AFP writes. ""The fictitious archaeologist manages to crack it in a novel.""

The Siloe team is working on crafting the reproductions now; it will take at least a year and a half for the first ones to be finished.

If you can't wait that long — or, you know, are looking for a price with fewer digits — Yale University Press has a printed facsimile coming to print this fall.

In the meantime, the digitized version is available through the Beinecke library's website, where it's described as a ""scientific or magical text in an unidentified language, in cipher."""

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Thanks, everybody. Great show for you today. Our guest later on will be broadcasting legend Katie Couric. She hosted ""The Today Show,"" anchored ""CBS Evening News,"" she reached the highest highs of journalism, and now she has a podcast. It just goes to show you no matter how high you rise, one tiny little slip up and you're back down here with us. We're interested in hearing you via old media, meaning the telephone. Give us a call to play our games. The number is 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

LOGAN ADAMS: Hi, this is Logan calling from Raleigh, N.C.

SAGAL: What do you do there in Raleigh?

ADAMS: I'm a college student, actually.

SAGAL: Oh, what are you studying?

ADAMS: Electrical engineering.

SAGAL: Oh that's good. That's useful. That's important.

ADAMS: Yeah.

SAGAL: You'll be able to find a job.

ADAMS: (Laughter) We hope.

SAGAL: Believe me, I come from a long line of liberal arts majors. You'll be fine.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Well, Logan, welcome to the show. Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First up is a writer for HBO's ""Real Time With Bill Maher,"" Mr. Adam Felber.

ADAM FELBER: Hey there, Logan.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Next, a comedian whose new live comedy CD, ""North By Northwest,"" is now available at Amazon, Barnes and Noble and at paulapoundstone.com. It's Paula Poundstone.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: Hey, Logan.

ADAMS: Hey, Paula.

(APPLAUSE)

POUNDSTONE: Logan, my dad was an electrical engineer, and he worked.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: And a comedian you can hear on the new Laugh.ly app, Alonzo Bodden.

(APPLAUSE)

ALONZO BODDEN: What's up, Logan?

ADAMS: Hey, Alonzo.

SAGAL: You're going to play Who's Bill This Time, Logan. Bill Kurtis, right now, is going to read you three quotations from the week's news. If you can correctly identify or explain just two of them, you will win our prize, scorekeeper emeritus Carl Kasell's voice on your voice mail. You ready to play?

ADAMS: Absolutely.

SAGAL: Let's do it. Here is your first quote.

KURTIS: If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people - maybe there is, I don't know.

SAGAL: That was somebody who was adding suggesting assassination to his long and distinguished resume this week. Who was it?

ADAMS: I would assume it was Donald Trump.

SAGAL: It was, of course, Donald Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: According to Donald Trump, no, no, no, he was not saying he wanted people to shoot Hillary Clinton. That's a media distortion based on the words he actually said.

(LAUGHTER)

FELBER: I like the way that when he says things like that thing that he said...

SAGAL: Yeah.

FELBER: ...He acts like it - you know, it's real subtle and it might even be going over some people's heads, and it's really not.

SAGAL: Yeah.

FELBER: He's like that buffoon who's dropping an innuendo into the conversation and thinks that nobody's getting it. He's like, yes, waitress, I'd like a couple more tomatoes (laughter). I mean breasts (laughter). He's that guy.

SAGAL: So we're all kind of reeling with the Hillary - the Second Amendment thing, and then the next day he started saying that President Obama was the founder of ISIS. He said, and I quote him, ""Obama is the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder. He founded ISIS,"" unquote.

(LAUGHTER)

FELBER: What do you think he meant?

SAGAL: So not only is Donald Trump wrong about ISIS, he's also a terrible rapper.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

BODDEN: I can only imagine his staff, like, every time he does this - right? - because last week, like, he threw a baby out of a rally.

SAGAL: Right.

BODDEN: And they're like, no, you've got to clean that up. You've got to somehow get them to forget that.

SAGAL: Yeah.

BODDEN: So it's like, OK, I'll threaten to kill Hillary Clinton. No...

SAGAL: No, no.

BODDEN: ...You've got to clean that up. You've got to say something to clean that up. OK, Barack Obama started ISIS. No.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Here is your next quote.

KURTIS: This is an electronic Watergate. This is a break-in.

SAGAL: That was Nancy Pelosi responding to news that what may have been much more extensive than originally thought?

ADAMS: Oh, was it the DNC leaks?

SAGAL: Yes, it was the DNC hack.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: That's very good. Good job, Logan.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You all remember that right before the Democratic Convention, WikiLeaks put out all these emails from the DNC that made the Democrats look bad, stuff about them trying to hurt Bernie and a bunch of kombucha recipes.

BODDEN: Shouldn't there just be somebody on top of these things, particularly with Hillary's history with email? Like, I wouldn't allow Hillary any more than an AOL account with parental controls.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

BODDEN: I've never seen such a professional, slick organization have this much trouble with something so simple as, like, hey, you're not allowed to use that email server for that, you know what I mean? Like, this email is blocked. You know, like, I don't have one porn account in my actual name.

SAGAL: No.

BODDEN: I didn't need someone to tell me that.

SAGAL: Yeah.

BODDEN: I was like, you know, this would probably be a good idea to come up with a code.

SAGAL: (Laughter).

FELBER: Shmalonzo (ph).

BODDEN: Yeah, something that they can't figure out.

FELBER: Having read a bunch of the emails, one thing that I find really interesting about them is that when she gets emails from Nigerian princes looking for lost funds, it's not spam.

SAGAL: That's true.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Adam, you can't just say you read them and then not tell us. OK, what did some of them say? I haven't read them.

FELBER: They're really dull.

POUNDSTONE: Like what?

FELBER: Like, there's a trip to Indonesia coming and somebody sends her some stats about it, and she sends an email back going, yes, thanks, please print.

SAGAL: There's one email in...

FELBER: ...Like, half of the emails from Hillary Clinton are please print because she wants to go traveling with these papers that she's being shown.

POUNDSTONE: What - maybe she's having - maybe this - OK, this could be a good thing for the Trump campaign - maybe she has stock in ink.

FELBER: Oh.

SAGAL: Yeah.

FELBER: Toner stock.

SAGAL: Yeah.

POUNDSTONE: Exactly.

FELBER: She's in the pocket of big toner.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: I think it's something to think about.

BODDEN: That would be great, except...

FELBER: ...She has ink on her hands.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

POUNDSTONE: She's covered in ink.

SAGAL: So, Logan, here is your last quote.

KURTIS: We expect the color to be back to blue soon.

SAGAL: That was an official talking about a pool that mysteriously turned green this week. That's one of the many things that seemed to go wrong where?

ADAMS: In Rio.

SAGAL: In Rio for the Olympics. Yes, very good, Logan.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: These Olympics in Rio have a particular fascination. We're watching not because of the amazing competition, but because at any moment something insane might happen. There haven't been any, like, building collapses, as people were afraid, but a guy got mugged outside the main stadium, which would not be that weird if the victim were not the head of security for the entire Olympics.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Is that true?

SAGAL: That's absolutely true.

BODDEN: Yes.

POUNDSTONE: Oh my gosh.

SAGAL: He never saw that coming.

POUNDSTONE: Yeah. You know, too busy taking care of others.

SAGAL: And we've already mentioned that the diving pool suddenly turned green.

FELBER: Like, bright green.

SAGAL: Like, really bright green.

POUNDSTONE: Well, everyone knows why that happened.

SAGAL: Why did that happen?

POUNDSTONE: They have that chemical in the pool that if somebody peed in it, it would...

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Sure, absolutely.

SAGAL: You'd know, absolutely.

POUNDSTONE: Yeah.

FELBER: I think that - I think maybe one of the Russian divers cut himself.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: It wasn't so weird that it turned green. It was weird when the Chinese diver bounced off it. That was...

FELBER: Oh, it was Jell-O.

SAGAL: This is also true...

BODDEN: ...It's actually good incentive for a diver because how small a splash are you trying to make in green water? You are getting in and getting out like a dart.

SAGAL: That's true. (Laughter) It's funny to see a diver go off the board and he sees the water and he tries not to fall. He's like (yelling).

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: There have been some wonderful things. Michael Phelps, American hero, won his...

POUNDSTONE: ...Yeah, baby.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: People like Michael Phelps - won his 20th Olympic gold medal, breaking a record held by, and I am not kidding, Leonidas of Rhodes back in 164 B.C.

FELBER: Overrated.

SAGAL: Much like Phelps, Leonidas also smoked a fair bit of weed.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Wow.

BODDEN: Do you think the other athlete - the other swimmers would be OK with Michael Phelps smoking weed?

SAGAL: I think they'd be fine.

BODDEN: They'd be like, go ahead, Mike, you get high. Then we'll have a chance. Matter of fact, we brought some for you.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: You know what I think is most amazing about the events at the swimming pool? It's that I think that they could not interview the athletes when they come out of the pool and it would be just as satisfying to the viewer.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: I mean...

FELBER: I don't think it's the interviewers' fault.

POUNDSTONE: No.

FELBER: 'Cause, like, these are people who do the same thing all day, every day, for years. And so I - you know, the interviewer says - asks them a question and all they've got to tell you is, yeah, I swam really fast in a line.

Flatly saying or writing that Planned Parenthood officials have been secretly recorded discussing the sale of fetal tissue is akin to concluding that they committed a crime. That is a problem. We should not attach such judgments to people or institutions until the confessions or convictions are in.

We’ve been on the story. Meanwhile, both FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have explored what is and isn’t known at this point about what Planned Parenthood has done. FactCheck links to the 1993 law that defines what is and is not legal regarding the use of fetal tissue. Here are two key sections:

– “PURCHASE OF TISSUE — It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.”

– “The term ‘valuable consideration’ does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.”

The video makers and other Planned Parenthood critics say the organization was selling fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says the tissue has been donated, not sold, and that only the organization’s costs (reasonable payments) have been covered.

The facts are not all in.

For now, just as we would report that “prosecutors say John Doe robbed the bank,” we should attribute references to fetal tissue being sold. They’re coming from “Planned Parenthood’s critics,” for example. Conversely, at this point it is for Planned Parenthood to say — not us — that these were donations, not sales.

In the short space of a Newscast spot, an “allegedly” or “accused of” may be required when there isn’t time to say more.

There are cases to be made for saying that Planned Parenthood officials were heard discussing how they could “provide” fetal tissue to researchers, or how those researchers could “procure” or “obtain” it. The issue of money being paid should be addressed in most reports. But, again, attribution is important when characterizing those payments.

Updated at 6 p.m. with judge's ruling

Usually when there's a question about who created a piece of art, the artist is dead and can't speak for himself — he can't say, ""Hey, I made that,"" or ""Nope, not mine."" But this is a story about a living artist who went to court to prove that a painting in fact is not his. And on Tuesday, a judge in Chicago agreed.

The painting in question is a desert landscape. There's blue sky at the top, red rocks and green cacti. It's owned by Robert Fletcher, a 62-year-old former corrections officer living in the Canadian city of Sault Ste. Marie. Here's how Fletcher says he got the painting: In 1976, he was working in Ontario's Thunder Bay Correctional Centre when he hit it off with an inmate named Peter Doige, who was in for LSD possession. Doige was going through some rough times, but he had this painting he had made in art class.

""I said, 'That painting you did inside, that desert scene, I absolutely love it,' "" Fletcher remembers. ""He said, 'Would you give me $100 for it?' "" Fletcher said yes.

A couple of decades later, a buddy of Fletcher's is over at his house and sees the painting. He tells Fletcher that it's by a famous artist — Peter Doig. They look him up online and Fletcher recognizes him. ""We watched some videos online of him being interviewed and the first thing I remember noticing is his body language — you know, some facial expressions and his use of his hands,"" Fletcher says.

Peter Doig is a pretty famous artist — last year, one of his paintings sold at auction for nearly $26 million. So Fletcher tried to sell his painting. That's when representatives for Doig came back and said the painting wasn't a Doig. Not only that, but Peter Doig doesn't know Robert Fletcher. And while he did do LSD in the '70s, Doig's representatives say he was never in jail.

For most people, that would be the end of it, but Fletcher and the owner of the gallery he hired to sell the painting were so convinced it was a Doig that they lawyered up and went to court.

Sergio Muñoz Sarmiento has worked in art law for over a decade. He says, ""It's odd in the sense that this is the first time that I'm aware of that an artist is being asked to testify that a work of art was not made by him. ... Even if you're alive, how do we say this is a work by you and this is not a work by you?""

Here's another complication: The signature on the painting in question spells the artist's last name Doige, with an e, but the famous artist spells his name with no e. And there was a Peter Doige in the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre in the 1970s. According to his sister, he was fond of art and music and liked to paint. Doige died in 2012.

After Tuesday's ruling, Doig's lawyer, Matthew Dontzin, released a statement that said, ""I have rarely seen such a flagrant example of unethical conduct in the U.S. courts nor a case that inflicted such needless burdens on a defendant. Artists should be grateful to Peter for having the ethical and financial fortitude to fight tirelessly to ensure that justice prevailed in today's verdict."""

When referring to the decision to switch Flint’s water supply, unless you’re going to go into a long explanation please say the decision was made by “government officials.” As Michigan Radio’s timeline shows, there were many players.

Mr. and Mrs. Null weren't the only ones who had problems this year. The CIA did as well. Here's our panel trying to figure it all out.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SAGAL: Paula, the CIA recently completed a successful week of training using some school buses they borrowed from a school district in Virginia nearby. They returned the buses in great condition, except they forgot something in one of the buses. What?

POUNDSTONE: A waterboarding...

SAGAL: No.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: ...Chair.

SAGAL: No, I'll give you a hint. To be fair to the CIA, we've all done it. You know the feeling - you lock your car, you walk away. All of a sudden you're like, oh, no, and you start looking in your pockets. And then the car explodes.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Oh, they left a bomb in there?

SAGAL: They left explosives in the school bus…

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: …Is what they did.

POUNDSTONE: Oh, jeez.

SAGAL: So the CIA was training bomb-sniffing dogs, which means they had to use explosives, which they hid in these school buses and let the dogs find. Great. But they kind of forgot one little package of plastic explosive. The dog tried to tell them, but the CIA had fired all their bark translators.

(LAUGHTER)

TOM BODETT: Lassie would have written it in the mashed potatoes.

SAGAL: Apparently, yeah. So anyway, the bus was used after the CIA gave it back to drive kids around for two days before a school maintenance worker found the explosives and realized it just wasn't the same brand of plastic explosive that the school district used.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The CIA says that nobody was ever in danger because when is the last time anything the CIA did actually worked?

(LAUGHTER)

GROSZ: They're just probably kids on the school bus like kicking it and, like, shoving each other into it and sticking pencils into it.

SAGAL: It was actually - it was hidden in the engine compartment...

POUNDSTONE: Oh.

SAGAL: ...Which is where they had put it.

GROSZ: That’s so much safer.

NBC had decidedly mixed results when it comes to ratings for its 17 days of coverage from the Summer Olympics in Rio.

According to figures released Monday, NBC drew an average total audience of 25.4 million viewers on its broadcast network in prime time, or 198 million people overall on TV.

Combine figures from broadcast, cable and online and the tally jumps to 27.5 million; enough to boost viewership for NBC programs like the Today show and NBC Nightly News while also bringing victories over network and cable TV competitors.

But those numbers weren't nearly as good as the ratings four years ago from the London Games, which drew an average 31.1 million viewers in prime time, according to an NBC release. Back then, the 2012 games were touted as the most watched TV event in U.S. history.

In fact, the average 27.5 million viewers drawn by the Rio Games were the first time the total audience went down from a previous Olympics since the contests in Sydney back in 2000, according to figures provided by NBC.

NBC tried to put a better spin on the ratings in its press release for the Rio Games, calling the Rio Olympics the most successful media event in history. That's because NBC this year broadcast 6,755 hours of programming on broadcast networks, online and over its NBC Sports app.

""Our planning production and presentation of the Rio games ... is the most impressive undertaking I've seen in the media world,"" NBC Sports Group Chairman Mark Lazarus said in the release. ""This is the most ambitious task in the media business, and our team ... all deserve a gold medal.""

Multiple platforms

The NBC release is careful to note that the 2012 Olympics didn't feature live events online and on cable channels at the same time as the network's prime-time coverage. That situation was a first for this year's games, which meant NBC might have been competing with itself for viewers of live events on its many different platforms.

It is possible that online viewing had an impact on TV ratings. NBC says a total of 100 million unique users accessed the digital coverage for the Rio Games, a 29 percent increase from the London Games.

The NBC Sports app even provided notification messages to smartphones and tablets alerting users when important games were about to start. But NBC's release also says 95 percent of prime-time viewers watched the games on the network, indicating online use still had a tiny impact on the most important viewership.

As usual, NBC racked up lots of complaints for its coverage, including barbs about the number of commercials. Social media ensured that even casual viewers knew how many events turned out before they were broadcast.

And the dominance of superstar athletes like Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and American swimmer Michael Phelps created a string of near-certain victories that could have removed some of the suspense.

Whatever the reason, this year's Olympics failed to deliver ratings in the way NBC had hoped, raising questions about whether viewers still see the games as appointment television.

Given that NBC has paid billions to air the games through to 2032, this might be a serious problem indeed over time."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

Over the weekend we asked Ann Powers and Jason King to wrestle with Frank Ocean's long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Channel Orange. They did so across many time zones and man hours; what emerged is a conversation that stays fair-minded and grounded and ends in questioning both the artist and his audience. We find it impossible and personally limiting to consider this album outside of its context, so the below is as much a state of affairs as it is a straight-ahead review.

(Ann Powers and Jason King write about both the physical and digital versions of the album interchangeably. And without clarity regarding the whole listing vs. cover art spelling situation, we're calling it Blonde throughout.)

Ann Powers: When he began to put himself into the mind-frame that would inspire his new album Blonde, Frank Ocean imagined himself in a moving car. He was, in this waking dream, a girl. ""Two years ago I found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face,"" the artist wrote in an essay posted on his Tumblr the day this weekend the album, four years in the making, finally became available."" A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head."" Ocean imagined himself wriggling against the seatbelt, he wrote, playing with its tension until it no longer constrained him. This feeling of freedom within containment, of traveling at a high speed on a course that is smooth and open — and of being comfortable with motion even in your most vulnerable, childlike moods — was the one that best fed the creativity he needed to complete an album as highly anticipated as any to come out this year, even though, since he relocated from California to the clogged streets of London, Ocean doesn't even drive much any more.

Ocean is a car enthusiast in real life. When he lived in Los Angeles, he owned three BMWs and was rebuilding a fourth. He populates his artistic world with references to Ferraris and Bugattis, the way many rappers do, but also to Acuras and Camrys, conduits to solitude, pleasure and escape for more average folk. In ""Nights,"" one of the 17 circuitous, absorbing tracks on the digital version of Blonde, the New Orleans-born Ocean remembers cruising in his family's Honda before Katrina forced him out of the city. ""Kept at least six discs in the changer,"" he recalls, rhyming in a sing-song cadence over a woozy keyboard line. It's easy to imagine that CD changer containing the music that drifts and melds within the hard-to-define sound Ocean cultivates on Blonde: Stevie Wonder next to The Beatles next to Crescent City rappers and his mom's Hammond organ-driven gospel favorites. In other songs, Ocean locates erotic pleasure within car interiors, and safety ""like an armored truck,"" and even rebirth, when he finds the feathers of a mythical phoenix on his dashboard. (It must have been a Pontiac.) But ""Nights"" places the sound of Blonde itself within that cocoon-like space, connecting it to a process of listening and absorbing hours of source material which, though it might be shared with one or two fellow riders, is ultimately private and introspective, the quiet side of taking the open road.

""The stillness is the move,"" goes the hook of a song by the Dirty Projectors, whose vocalist Amber Coffman is one of many guests from the cutting edges of various music scenes who appear on Blonde. The idea expressed in that phrase is fundamental to Ocean's musical approach, even more so now than in his earlier work that challenged received ideas of both R&B and indie pop. The rhythms on Blonde are cool, languid and minimal. Guitar and keyboard lines swell and brush against each other, rarely coalescing into hooks or stirring choruses. Some tracks are as dense as they are short, while others segment and land in structures that don't conform to traditional songcraft at all. The stories he tells within these prismatic songs, many explicitly erotic, gain their power from the music's tonal shifts and hard to track reference points. The lyrics only half-tell them, though, and only in deep dialogue with music that carries the listener deeper into reflection.

Introversion defines Ocean's stance throughout Blonde, even when he's reaching out to a lover; those lovers are often merely shadows on the passenger seat anyway. One reason his music captures so many people's imaginations now is that it's supremely ruminative, dedicated to exploring how memories drift, dissolve, reassemble themselves to form the narratives that inwardly define us, and how desire arises within a story each person tells herself as she reaches toward another. ""Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought that could think of the dreamer in the thought,"" Ocean rhymes in ""Seigfried,"" imagining God at the end of that particular road, but not the lover for whom he longs. A guitar loop forms a membrane around the image, expanding it infinitely. When, moments later, he murmurs, ""I'd do anything for you"" to the object of his longing, the feeling is peaceful, infusing heartache with mindfulness. This is what Ocean offers that listeners crave — an antidote to the industrious and cynical persona building that dominates so much of popular culture now; a focus on process that feels so foreign to many listeners that they consider it a mystery. It's not a mystery. It's an articulation of what happens when each of us keeps her thoughts to herself.

Advisory: This video contains nudity.

Jason King: So Blonde is the album that was formerly going to be known as Boys Don't Cry (which has now become the name of a one-off 360-page magazine associated with the physical release of the album that you could, briefly, pick up in four pop-ups, newsstands and a bookstore, in LA, New York, Evanston, Ill. and London). The original album title would have been especially fitting this week, as it so eerily resonates with the arresting photograph and accompanying video of 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh, the baby from Aleppo who sat drenched in blood and dust and stunned into silence after rescue workers removed him from post-airstrike rubble and propped him up in an emergency vehicle. Part of the reason that image has circulated so widely as a profound commentary on the horrors of the Syrian conflict is that Omran doesn't cry in the face of such catastrophe; instead, he looks like the oldest of old souls, and we find ourselves watching him work through unimaginable trauma in real-time. Indeed, we're watching him while his life is splitting in two and tearing apart; if he's frazzled, or discombobulated, Omran is bravely keeping it inside, or he has no expression for what he's feeling. Boys don't cry, in part, because men refuse to cry: the toxic masculinity and weaponized lack of empathy that underwrite so many of our most pressing contemporary geopolitical conflicts are just two of the elements that have helped foment the incredibly tragic situation that Omran finds himself in.

And so it's fitting, given the times in which we live, that Frank Ocean has made a deeply empathetic and passionate album that's partly about his own ongoing struggle with masculinity and emotionalism. Quilted from fragmented ideas, observations and submerged memories around the vicissitudes of heartbreak and loss, Ocean manages to process his relation to that personal trauma for us in the most intimate and fragile of ways. We're listening to him work through some deeply personal moments, even if we don't always know what the referents for those moments are. I can't help but note that some of the most potent recordings this year made by black men — such as The Life of Pablo by Kanye West and Chance the Rapper's mixtape Coloring Book — wade deeply, and even self-consciously, into impressionistic emotionalism and into gospel-influenced questions of existence. And they offer us existential musings at a crucial time, when far too many people still can't seem to figure out whether black lives matter enough to change their own.

And yet nothing is ever so straight-ahead or open-faced with Ocean. His music, like his career as a whole, more often than not revolves around ambiguities and offhand non sequiturs. Apple Music lists the digital version as Blonde, as does the magazine page that serves as the physical's gatefold, but the cover art reads Blond. Here, as on previous efforts, Ocean seems profoundly interested in identities that, for any number of reasons, have become torn apart (his own and those of the other characters he observes, too). He's obsessed with people whose lives are split between past and present realities, people who move erotically between men and women, between warring ideals of masculine and feminine, and black and white, and gay and straight. This weekend alone, he released one audiovisual work and two different versions of the same album, and, though the two versions are not radically different from each other (there are five more tracks on the digital than the physical, but the physical includes two that aren't on the digital), I think he wants us to know he goes both ways in all aspects of life. At the very least, he doesn't subscribe to the idea of one thing or the other.

To be fair, I'm also of two minds about Blonde: musically and sonically, it's certainly consistent with today's conceptually-artsy hip-hop and R&B-influenced pop, including Rihanna's ANTI and Beyoncé's Lemonade, as well James Blake's The Colour in Anything and maybe even Banks' forthcoming The Altar. But critics' gleeful celebration these days of anything that registers as experimental ""avant-soul"" — if that term ever even really suits the music — usually neglects to mention intrinsic flaws such as drifty songwriting that is too often formless and the pursuit of tone that is too often samey. It's hard to be definitive about these critiques with Ocean's newest releases. Taken together, Endless and Blonde were designed to flood the commercial marketplace in the late summer, and they've done so in a way that means — at least for journalists tasked with covering the musical and pop cultural moment — there's really just too much complex music to digest well in such a compressed time. Both records could gain in their power and resonance as we have a chance to really dig in a bit more; or their flaws may appear more pronounced in the absence of hype and four long years of expectation and anticipation.

Ann Powers: Though Ocean is often romanticized as a mysterious figure and his music cast as avant-garde, it's perhaps more informative to think of Blonde as his way of revisiting and, in so doing, recasting the canon of classic rock. He's been open about the influence of The Beatles, whose ""Here, There, and Everywhere"" he quotes in the song ""White Ferrari,"" and The Beach Boys, whose Brian Wilson almost enlisted him as a collaborator last year (although Wilson has said that didn't work out because Ocean ""wanted to do rap""). Wilson's influence is strong throughout Blonde, ringing through its lyrical melodies and ornate yet cleanly constructed arrangements. There's also something very Brian about the way Ocean always seems to stand alone within his compositions, even though his list of collaborators numbers in the dozens. Frequently dwelling over states of dislocation and loneliness, Ocean's songs touch a nerve similar to those that The Beach Boys' sad auteur captured. When Wilson, as an adult, was making Smile, he called his grandiose, innocent-sounding songs ""a teenage symphony to God."" Parts of Blonde are more psychedelic than even Wilson's more far-out efforts, exhibiting less craving for radio airplay. It could be called a teenage symphony to weed.

Yet Ocean's mind games never stray too far from his grounding in sensuality. This is something he shares with the Beatle I'd bet is his favorite, Paul McCartney, along with a wry sense of humor that shows itself in punny wordplay (boy, does Frank love homonym-ish pairings like ""solo"" and ""so low"" or ""inhale and ""in hell"") and in colorful descriptions of street scenes and shady characters. Something essential in Ocean's songs celebrates the pleasure of music itself. It feels so good when he lets his voice loose on an arching chorus or croons his way through a well-modulated verse, exhibiting the same kind of tunefulness that got Macca labeled ""the cute one."" Ocean's cute bona fides are reinforced by other reference points: in the essence of Burt Bacharach that infuses his Beyoncé collaboration, ""Pink + White,"" and the way he pays homage to Stevie Wonder paying homage to the easy-listening, hard-loving Carpenters in his attenuated but striking retake of ""Close To You.""

Wonder is a crucial figure within Ocean's realm of influence, another African-American emissary between musical genres whose experimentalism was tempered by a killer pop sense. With the inimitable run of joyfully mind-expanding albums that began with 1972's Music of My Mind, Wonder toppled the racist hierarchies that placed the efforts of white musicians like Wilson and The Beatles above those by the African-American ""entertainers"" whose innovations had, in fact, provided the basis for all of rock. On his last album, Channel Orange, Ocean made the Wonder connections obvious, whereas here they're more confined as he explores other palettes, including a host of guitar effects inspired by British bands like U2. (Brian Eno, who pioneered the ""infinite guitar"" sound frequently invoked on Blonde, is listed in the album's credits, though whether he worked on the recording or was merely sampled is unclear.) But Ocean continues to aim for that spirit of effortless artiness, and of experimentation grounded in pleasure and the pursuit of beauty, at the heart of Wonder's work.

Pleasure is one of Ocean's main preoccupations. One way to listen to Blonde is as an album about sex: from the droll reference to masturbation that begins ""Solo,"" to the lascivious come-ons of ""Self Control"" to the blatant descriptions that still come off as romantic in ""Skyline To,"" Ocean embraces carnality as a treasure, sometimes frustrating because of its elusiveness but always worth pursuing. The frankness Ocean embraces is, of course, a central element of much American popular music and has been since the women who made the blues popular in the early 20th century spoke openly of the power, heat and sorrow in their own hips. In some ways, pop today is more explicit than ever; hip-hop has considerably furthered the artistry of the off-color metaphor, and R&B's bedroom jams celebrate sexual satisfaction in no uncertain terms. (Rock has actually grown more prudish in recent years, tending toward a sort of chaste earnestness or the high school-level jokes of the Warped Tour.) Ocean connects with those histories in his work. Yet throughout Blonde, he tells stories of sexual connection and disconnection that take on a different character than is often evident in current pop. His very matter-of-factness strips away the posturing that demands sexuality be a public performance and reinstates a believable sense of intimacy. That Ocean's own sexuality is, as he describes it, ""dynamic"" — a quality he shares with many millennials and teens, who increasingly reject binary terms to describe both gender and desire — makes Blonde radical, not because he is anywhere near alone, but because he calmly insists that the listener embrace his view of pleasure as unexceptional, healthy, canonical.

Jason King: Ann, although intimacy and interiority are clearly part of what's compelling about Frank Ocean in 2016, he's also defined by a profound exteriority — his trickster-like fondness for showbiz hype. There aren't that many musicians left in 2016 who can conjure up Event Pop: in the '80s, Michael Jackson turned every album release into a full-fledged cultural happening; and more recently, entertainers like Beyoncé and Kanye West (and Radiohead, to a lesser degree) have carried the gloved one's baton with aplomb. Ocean's palette of tools, like enigma, teasing, misdirection and outright silence, may have ultimately managed to turn Blonde and Endless into cultural phenomena rather than just product.

Even in the streaming music era, in which increasingly fewer listeners have any real need to digest albums as integral wholes, Ocean remains that rare musician who has never not been an album artist. It's not just that he clearly knows how to put out albums with maximum fanfare, it's that he knows how to make art with a capital A, aided and abetted by a tightly-curated VIP list of collaborators on Blonde that includes Andre 3000, Tyler the Creator, Pharrell Williams and Endless' Jonny Greenwood. Plus, the twisted, lo-fi images of the music video for ""Nikes"" (directed by Tyrone Lebon) remind us that Ocean's music can never be fully extracted from the visuals (his lyrics are already themselves cinematic). If Ocean weren't making music, he'd probably be raking in bucks at an ad agency.

On Blonde, Ocean continues to make music that's an artistic distillation of Lexapro-era tristesse; he's got that in common with failure-obsessed millennial peers, everyone from album collaborator James Blake to Lena Dunham to The Weeknd. And even more than Channel Orange, Blonde — equal parts psychedelic indie rock, post-IDM electronica, post-U2/Coldplay-esque Eno-pop, post-Drake hip-hop, and post-Maxwell drifty soul/R&B —becomes an impressive showcase for Frank Ocean the creative producer. Those experimental, druggy sonics abound, showing up in the fried vocals and pitch-shifting on ""Nikes"" to the ambient whistles in ""Solo"" to the Rotary-Connection-like delayed vocals on ""Pretty Sweet"" to the scraping, backwards effects on ""Seigfried.""

Blonde's raw, bleeding, diaristic storytelling somehow makes me think about Sinead O'Connor, whose 1990 album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got was one of the first to seamlessly merge R&B, pop, rock and sampled hip-hop beats, in the context of confessional, warts-and-all lyrics about relationships lost and existential interiority. I'd argue that more than 25 years later, Blonde takes root in the world Sinead made possible: its best songs are troubled relationship tunes that feel like ripped pages in a worn diary, and they're often dark, moody and dream-like sinister, like the work of David Lynch or Frank Miller. On ""Ivy,"" Ocean writes breathlessly poetic lyrics: ""I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me / It started from nothing / I had no chance to prepare / I couldn't see you coming."" And on tuneful ""Solo"" he eloquently writes of ""A bull and a matador dueling in heaven / It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire / Inhale, inhale, that's heaven.""

Blonde also owes some debt to Meshell Ndegeocello, whose underappreciated 2000s albums like Cookie, Comfort Woman and Devil's Halo directly laid ground for the eccentric fusion of experimental soul, pop, R&B, rock and hip-hop we hear on Blonde. Like Ocean, Ndegeocello is black and queer, and raps and sings, and has always had an interest in alternative imaginings of masculinity in the context of either/or identities (the title of her outré 2007 album The World Has Made Me the Man of Our Dreams says it all). But bassist Meshell is known as a musician's musician with technical chops, whereas Ocean comes by much of his conventional musicianship externally, via collaborators (when, as Ann mentioned, on ""Close to You,"" he reworks Stevie Wonder vocoder samples and on ""White Ferrari,"" as he interpolates The Beatles; on ""Seigfried,"" where he draws liberally on an Elliot Smith melody).

You've noted that Ocean's songs come to us as fragments and ideas that challenge the conventions of pop and R&B, and yet he seems to have strayed very far from the tight slickness of songs like ""Novocaine"" on Nostalgia, Ultra. I'm not sure whether that's a step forward or backward. Certainly, anyone looking for Frank Ocean the strategic songsmith who once crafted a melodic nugget like ""I Miss You"" for Queen B might find far too much of Blonde meandering or unhemmed. The challenge for me is less about songwriting, and more about the deliberate lack of groove that comes as a result of Blonde's neglect of drums or basslines on songs like ""Skyline To."" To draw on that car metaphor, I want Blonde's engine to rev up more often than it does, and I'm occasionally disappointed when it doesn't.

Ann Powers: Jason, you address crucial issues that are so often overlooked, especially today, when the symbolic gestures of identity and power that our pop stars enact are mistaken for actual heroism. Ocean has the potential to influence people's views on love, sex, race and identity, and maybe the most open-hearted elements of Blonde will do so. Or, in the mainstream, he could just be another transient sensation. The helium atmosphere of sudden album releases and other highly engaging pseudo-events makes it hard to know how this album's impact will translate over time. Like a sullen millennial taking his most important college admissions test, Ocean answered years of hanging in the background with a weekend of high-profile overachieving. Music fans and the media were stunned to attention, as you've noted, by fancy graphics and a poem about McDonald's by Kanye West, confusing streaming options and the lines at those pop-ups. Will we still be listening to Blonde when the fall leaves turn? Only time will reveal its place in pop history. That lineage itself is changing; no longer do artifacts like albums occupy its center.

When an album does make a noticeable impact today, it's because a community coalesces around it. That's what happened with Lemonade, another collection of first-person songs that employed visuals to amplify its meanings and capture a larger audience than it likely would have as a mere musical release. Calling on a history book's worth of African-American women's expressive culture, Beyoncé's very personal (or, at least, strategically confessional) account of a rocky period in a marriage was embraced as a monumental act of making lives visible and audible. ""Lemonade is Beyoncé's intimate look into the multigenerational making and magic of black womanhood,"" wrote Zandria F. Robinson in Rolling Stone. The superstar's ability to connect her ""I"" with that ""we"" made not just a hit, but history.

Ocean does not seem inclined to reach out in this way. His own visual album, as I said in our previous discussion of Endless, felt more like a process-oriented conceptual art piece. And you're right about the songs on Blonde sparsely containing the elements that usually unite people behind a pop offering — most notably memorable beats. If the people can't dance, will anyone be part of your revolution?

Maybe Ocean doesn't really care. If the most prominent voices besides his own on Blonde indicate anything, it's that he's chosen a peer group only marginally interested in cultivating renown. Andre 3000, a legendary rapper who's repeatedly rejected the spotlight, claims the central cameo. Kendrick Lamar, whose recent success does demonstrate a strong sense of mission connected to fame, is present on one track, but mostly as a sound-effects generator. Ocean also relegates Beyoncé to background status in the last few bars of ""Pink + White."" It takes some chutzpah to put the Queen in that position.

A more telling partnership is the one Ocean shares on ""White Ferrari"" with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and James Blake, his bros in Auto-Tuned anguish. Beyond the lyrical references to both tripping and getting naked, which are very Frank, the track could have been made by any of those three beloved artistes. Here's where Ocean lives most comfortably right now, it seems: in the middle ground between high art and the arena, where a sympathetic audience will be patient with his musical wandering and lyrical obfuscations.

Yet Ocean also still pledges fealty to the crew that first nurtured him, the hip-hop iconoclasts of Odd Future. The final track on Blonde is ""Futura Free,"" a vocally distorted meditation on the tedium of success that concludes with a conversation, recorded long ago, with a couple of Ocean's old pals from that milieu. (One is his brother, the other, the skateboarder Sage Elsasser.) The voices, just kids' then, try to put a finger on their ambitions; nobody can really articulate what he wants. ""How far is a light year?"" someone asks. Ocean muddles this final question in noise. Is he ready to trace how far he's come? For now, he seems content to just share his view of the ride.

Jason King: Ocean's interest in the choreography of interpersonal relationships, and his poetic approach to missed opportunities for connection — people coming together, getting together, drifting apart — is certainly part of the melancholic beauty of his music. He paints erotic desire in complex hues and colors when so many of his musical peers are still using Crayolas.

We all know that in 2012, Ocean came out of the closet by refuting a cut-and-dry interpretation of his sexuality (and his lyrics), causing a seismic ripple in the default heteronormativity of hip-hop and R&B. In retrospect, he helped spawn the post-closet overground, creating space for the likes of queer, queer-identified and queer-allied artists ranging from Azealia Banks to Sam Smith and, yes, even Macklemore. Ann, as you note, Ocean has always approached sexual preference as fluid and dynamic, and he's mostly performed being queer more as a casual, implicit reality than some sort of external public achievement.

""Good Guy"" is a sketch of a song that appears to be the only explicit lyrical mention of same gender desire on Blonde. And even still, the narrative is broken in two: the first half is about a failed date at a gay bar, the second half is a conversation between two guys complaining about ""not having b****** no more."" Other songs (like ""Self Control,"" ""Ivy"" and ""Nights"") and sections of songs that deal with troubled love affairs specify no clear gender; they could go either way. Perhaps much of the album is about failed same-sex love; perhaps it is not. (We also don't really know yet to whom or what ""Seigfried"" refers). Other songs like ""Nikes"" make very specific reference to women (""these b****** want Nikes / they looking for a check""). While the promotion of sexual fluidity is rooted in allowing people to define sexuality away from conventions and binaries — though increasing research is demonstrating that sexuality is not quite as fluid a spectrum as Kinsey once argued — Ocean's circumscribed discussions of explicit same sex desire could be frustrating, rather than liberating, for many within and outside of LGBTQ communities.

In this light, Ann, Ocean's car motifs continue to fascinate, but I can't help also think that they are his main performative connection to a highly conventional symbol of machismo (which he, to his credit, acknowledges in his magazine when he says it might be linked to a ""deep, subconscious straight boy fantasy""). This is to say nothing of his continued evocation of drug-use, his lyrical use of invectives like ""n****"" and ""b******"" and not-uncommon mention of the word ""p****"" — all of which cosmologically connects him more closely to the PMRC sticker hip-hop tradition than to a sensual, retro R&B one.

I've written before that one of the reasons Ocean found widespread acceptance where other queer R&B and pop artists have failed — beyond his evocation of rock tropes like the guitar and his tales of straight women in strip clubs — is because there's a total absence of camp in his work. Moreover, in a song like ""Nikes,"" he shouts-out felled influences like A$AP Yams and Pimp C (rest in peace) and even Trayvon Martin — but there's no similar mention of slain LGB and trans folk (his emotional outpouring on Tumblr following the Orlando mass shooting doesn't explicitly show up in his Blonde lyrics). I say this not to police what Frank Ocean can or should say, nor how he should say it — only to mention there is a long venerable tradition where queer artists (in or out of the closet) engage in pre-emptive heteronormativity in the effort to avoid stigma and to fully crossover to straight audiences. It would be terribly tragic if Ocean's minimal attention to these matters in his lyrics happened to follow suit in that tradition.

I've recently been considering the idea that Napster helped create the reluctant pop star: so many musicians after 1999, in the absence of traditional record sales, found other ways to earn or bolster incomes, and found more stable lives to live. You see the evolution of the reluctant pop star today in the form of actor Donald Glover or golfer Justin Timberlake, where pop stardom is something you do on the side while you're doing everything else. You also see it in the form of Sia or Zayn, where being a pop star (beyond making pop music) is simply a burden to be dealt with, or a way of life that you shuttle off to the corner, like the act of moving a mound of wasabi away from your sushi.

Ocean seems to me the epitome of this millenia's reluctant pop star — he's a shrinking violet who went mostly invisible for the last four years; he rarely shows up to public events; and while he obviously knows how to write a solid radio-friendly pop song, he's become largely absorbed by other aesthetic pursuits. But the concept of the reluctant pop star has also merged into the concept of the silent pop star — that reclusive artist who rarely, if ever, does interviews, has highly controlled outgoing communications and practices withholding information from the public and press as a matter of course. Caginess and silence also happen to be the strategies of those of who know, or have known, something about living in closets.

In that sense, it's a bit of letdown that other than that off-the-cuff mention of Trayvon Martin in ""Nikes"" (""RIP Trayvon, that n**** look just like me""), nothing on Blonde speaks explicitly to the #blacklivesmatter movement (though one could generously look the album as a whole as impressionistically arguing for the importance of black life). Nothing on Blonde addresses the extreme crisis that is happening right now in black LGBT communities where the CDC has found that one out of every two black men who has sex with men is projected to become infected with HIV. This crisis is not just limited to the U.S.: it connects with the devastating criminalization of homosexuality in African nations like Nigeria and Uganda and European countries like Russia, and to the unacceptable persecution and brutalization of LGBT communities by terrorist groups like ISIS.

To be clear, I'm not making an argument that Ocean doesn't think about such things or that his heart doesn't bleed like everyone else's. It's also perfectly OK to not be a spokesperson or a role model or an activist, especially as pop and politics do not always make comfortable bedfellows. It's OK, and even progressive in some ways, to pursue a more sophisticated vision/version of what it means to be ""out"" than the rigid binary model currently embraced by global pride movements. And yet, given that he's released an album that's so raw, stripped-down and intimate, and believing as of course I do that Frank Ocean does indeed cry over the real time, existential threats that surely inform his everyday life as a not-completely-straight black American man making mainstream pop music given his considerable platform in 2016, I have to ask where, years after hauntingly evocative tracks like ""Bad Religion,"" is his will and courage — and maybe even his skill — to bring those life-and-death, topical concerns into his recordings? Or does his crossover super-ambition — as James Baldwin might put it, the price of the ticket — make the act of doing so simply out of his reach?"

If you haven’t read the news we posted Thursday, please do. Click on these headlines:

- Editor’s Note: Ethics Violations Identified In Several NPR Music And WQXR Reports

- Stories By A Contributing Writer Published On NPR.org That Contain Plagiarism

- NPR Acknowledges Plagiarism In 10 Music Stories

The ombudsman has also posted:

- Plagiarism Found In 10 NPR Music Stories

Before describing how this situation was handled, we should note that the Ethics Handbook is clear: “Plagiarism – taking someone else’s work and intentionally presenting it as if it is your own – is theft. At NPR it’s an unforgivable offense.”

The Handbook goes on to say:

“That means no material from another source should ever be included verbatim, or substantially so, without attribution. This includes material from Associated Press reports. We do not, for example, produce news ‘spots’ or other pieces that closely resemble wire service stories. NPR’s standard is that our writing should be our own. There is no excuse for writing that repeats the wire stories that we use word-for-word, or nearly so.”

Now, about how things were handled once we knew the extent of the problem.

We started from the position that when we make mistakes, we acknowledge them. Steps were taken to do that:

1. We stated as clearly as possible, in multiple places, what had happened and what we had done to correct the mistakes. That’s why there is an editor’s note signed by Mike Oreskes and WQXR General Manager Graham Parker, an editor’s note on top of the page where the stories in question were collected and editor’s notes on each of the 10 pages where the pieces originally appeared.

2. We did not try to hide the stories. They were all put on one page because we felt that would be a simple and user-friendly way to make them available to anyone who wanted to see what was in those pieces that had appeared elsewhere before.

3. We highlighted the words and phrases that had appeared elsewhere and linked to the places they had been drawn from. Again, we aimed to make it as simple as possible for anyone to see what had been done.

4. A headline and link to the main editor’s note was put on the NPR.org homepage.

5. The Two-Way was given no instructions other than to cover the news as it saw fit.

We will make mistakes, though hopefully none this serious. Steps similar to those taken in this situation may need to be repeated. Having them written down here may prove helpful in the future.

Before finishing, a couple more things should be noted.

The first sign that there was a problem came last Friday when copy editor Mark Mobley was checking an unusual spelling and came across a document with phrases much like those in the piece he was editing. He brought the duplication to the attention of editors at NPR Music. That was exactly the right thing to do. Mark was then asked to start going through the pieces the writer had done for NPR.org in the past. His research turned up the multiple examples.

Tom Huizenga, Jessica Goldstein and Jacob Ganz worked through this situation with what I would say was “firm compassion.” It is not easy to deal with news such as this when it involves a person you like and have enjoyed working with. They stayed focused on what was the right thing to do for NPR and its audience.

We all owe Mark, Tom, Jessica and Jacob a thanks.

Do you know that feeling when a song moves you so much, you just feel like you have to add your own voice? Mexican culture has an answer to that: a cathartic, joyous yell called a grito.

Legendary Mexican performer Vicente Fernández, aka ""Chente,"" performs the crazy tragic love song ""Volver, Volver."" ""It's one of the most iconic mariachi songs of all time, performed by the most popular Mexican mariachi vocalist ever,"" says alt.latino's Felix Contreras. ""And there is a championship grito at the top of the song.""

YouTube

Growing Up Hearing Gritos

Like lots of Mexican-American kids, Contreras and I grew up hearing the adults in our lives performing gritos when they listened to mariachi music at family barbecues, or cheering on friends and family at graduation.

""In my family, my mother and my grandfather, her step-dad, when we would be at family parties like Christmas or something like that, we'd be in the other room playing, we'd hear a really loud grito, we knew the party was on, it just took it to a different level,"" Contreras says. ""It was the ultimate expression that we were really having a good time.""

I am pretty sure I could identify my tíos and tías by their gritos, and many Mexican-American children begin finding their own grito voice early.

Like many schools in Texas, students at Perez Elementary school in Austin have the opportunity to learn and perform mariachi music. Their teacher, Angela Machado, is too busy teaching them chords and song lyrics to teach them gritos. ""It is not part of the curriculum necessarily but I know a lot of them do already know how,"" she says.

Third graders Leo Garcia, Jose Jaimes, Mario Flores and Angelita Alivter Cardenas show me their gritos. They sound like lion cubs learning how to roar.

If they want to keep working on their gritos, these kids may have a chance in college. Ezekiel Castro is a lecturer at the University of Texas Sarah and Ernest Butler School of Music. He is also director of the school's mariachi ensemble and teaches about mariachi culture. The grito is an important part of that.

""The Mexicans are very emotional people,"" says Castro. ""When they hear mariachi music, whether it's because of sorrow or because of joy, they do these gritos, these yells."" Castro says his students do a much better grito than he does. ""Some people are just exquisite with it. Others, you know, we just do the best we can.""

Gritos aren't just emotional; they're political. One of Mexico's founding fathers uttered the first documented grito in history when he declared the war for Mexican independence. The president of Mexico does a more formal grito every year on that anniversary, as Enrique Peña Nieto did in 2015.

Grito 101

YouTube

Laura Gutierrez teaches Mexican performance studies at the University of Texas. She says gritos are complex expressions. ""They're like small narrative capsules, without the narrative that are full of layers of emotion,"" Gutierrez says. And belting out a great grito feels really good. ""When you finally release the last gasp of air, there's relief,"" Gutierrez says.

Video producer Kathryn Gonzales rediscovered the grito at a 2014 Day of the Dead party in west Texas. ""I was the only brown person at the whole party,"" Gonzales says. ""There was a little conjunto band and I was so moved, I don't even really honestly remember the song, but I was compelled to do a grito.""

But there were two things stopping her. ""I thought well, A, I don't know if anyone here would know what that was and why I was doing it,"" Gonzales says. ""And B, I thought I don't really know if I know how to do a good grito, like I'm not sure that I could pull it off.""

So Gonzales teamed up with a developer friend and created the Grito App.

""You scroll through the different sounds, each sound has its own screen. You can learn a little more about the grito, you can share the grito, you can save it to your videos and just kind of text it or email it around,"" Gonzales says.

Since mariachi music is less popular among newer generations, not that many young people know how to do a good grito. Castro says that's no reason not to try. ""Everybody has their own individual way of doing gritos,"" he says. ""It's a great expression.""

Growing Into Gritos

Felix Contreras tried to do a grito when he was a college student at Cal State University Fresno in the late '70s. His friends would have grito contests after a long night. ""It was pathetic. I thought, 'Ugh, I definitely won't be doing that again.'""

And even though his alt.latino co-host Jasmine Garsd has been trying to get him to do a grito on-air, Contreras says he won't do it. ""You have to not be afraid to be the subject of attention in a small world,"" Contreras says. ""You have to use the front of the diaphragm, full of gusto, and release anguish and joy from your soul to do a successful grito.""

Contreras has found himself listening to more mariachi music over the years. ""It's an acquired taste as you get older, you experience life's heartbreaks and joys, the lyrics and the recitations and the performance resonates in a different way,"" Contreras says. ""It has all the secrets to life in the lyrics. You don't know that when you're in your twenties.""

""By the time you hit your forties, Chente knew what he was talking about,"" Contreras says. And you might feel inspired to try out your own grito."

Ghost Talkers by Mary Robinette Kowal Hardcover, 304 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Look, I am solidly a ray-guns-and-spaceships kind of genre nerd. Never been much for fantasy done after the 1970s (it mostly sounds like bad Tolkien). Never cared much for ghost stories or alternate histories or love stories or horror.

Which is why, on the surface, it might seem odd that I was so thoroughly taken in by Mary Robinette Kowal's newest novel, Ghost Talkers. I mean, it's essentially an alternate history love story with ghosts in it. Lots and lots of ghosts. And therefore falls firmly into that sprawling pile of Stuff I Wouldn't Read On A Bet.

Except check this out: The hook for it? It's World War I and the British have a whole division called the Spirit Corps who contribute to the war effort by talking to the ghosts of (very) recently dead soldiers in order to gain intelligence about the goings-on at the front. Where did the bullet come from that killed you? At what angle did it enter? Did you hear the crack of the shot? See the German who shot you?

The mediums take reports from every soldier killed. It's a grind of a job and Kowal makes you feel it — makes it almost forensic, almost scientific, in its application. The information taken down by the mediums is all intelligence, and it is used to direct fire, to plan attacks, to shift defenses. It figures into strategy on both sides, and there's nothing hand-wavey about it. Very little that seems mushy and spiritualist. This is a hard job done by those few volunteers who have a sensitivity for the work, and it is vital.

It was the idea of it that got me into the book, and Kowal's affectless presentation of the mediums and their work that kept me going. Did it help that the main plot concerns American heiress Ginger Stuyvesant (a working medium, exhausted and burnt-out by the stresses of experiencing the deaths of hundreds of young men) and her fiancé, British intelligence agent Benjamin Hartford? Of course it did. I like a good spy story as much as anyone (even without spaceships). And once things get going, Ghost Talkers has a good thrust with the Germans trying to discover the location of the Spirit Corps, a highly-placed mole in the British command, secret murderers, double crosses, codes and ciphers.

... it was that rare ability of Kowal's to make what could have been a completely goofy add-on to the British war effort into something that felt completely wedded and solid that sold me — that spark of a great idea, well-executed.

But it was that rare ability of Kowal's to make what could have been a completely goofy add-on to the British war effort into something that felt completely wedded and solid that sold me — that spark of a great idea, well-executed. It is a story that just works. That lays out a presumption (ghosts are real), builds a plot architecture around it (they might be useful intelligence assets), and then grounds it with emotional weight (those forced to talk to the ghosts of the young and dead might not come out of it unscathed).

The book has flaws, of course. For every deeply considered character like Ginger or her fiancé, there are two who are adorable stereotypes (the excellent Lady Penfold, for example — a professional gossip, titular head of the Corps and, essentially, Downton Abbey's Dowager Countess with a sense of humor and a pistol), and one who is just plain cardboard, like the harrumphing, mustache-twirling, tea-and-crumpets marionette of a general who seems to exist solely to tell Ginger she's being hysterical at every opportunity. And because of some baked-in deus ex machina, there is rarely a moment where it feels as though Ginger is in any real danger (with one notable exception late in the novel).

But still, the plot moves. The ghosts stack up. With the aid of her fiancé and his stuttering personal aide, Ginger travels from the relative safety of Le Havre to the trenches of the front, to POW camps and beyond. There's an undeniable momentum to Kowal's writing, and even in the rough spots, she keeps it going with Ginger's pluck, some spy-vs-spy cleverness and a couple of surprising betrayals.

Still, it's unfortunate, these weaknesses at the center of things. Because Kowal does such a stellar job with making the ridiculous seem grounded. She has the mechanics of ghosts down pat. The history of spiritualism. The shadowy life of ghostly spies.

It's only the real people that occasionally trip her up.

Veronica Roth is the best-selling author of ""Divergent."" For our ""Next Chapter"" series, she talks about a relationship that consumed her life and how she finally left it behind.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Throughout August, we're bringing you stories and advice from authors who've written for young people about that pivotal moment where they have left home and set out on their own. It's a series we call Next Chapter. Today, we hear from Veronica Roth. She's the author of the best-selling young adult sci-fi series ""Divergent,"" though that's not what she says when she meets people.

VERONICA ROTH: Usually, when I introduce myself at schools, I just say I'm Veronica. I write books.

SIMON: Veronica Roth came of age in the mid-aughts in a suburb of Chicago.

ROTH: One of those towns that I feel like they based the movie ""Mean Girls"" off of (laughter). Like a - like a highly competitive educational environment but also, like, a good place to live.

(SOUNDBITE OF NE-YO SONG, ""SO SICK"")

ROTH: The story of my leaving home is kind of inextricably tied to my high school boyfriend.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SO SICK"")

NE-YO: Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do (ph).

ROTH: He was staying around my town. He was going to community college in the area, and I was leaving. I was going to Minnesota. I was about to leave, and he was really upset with me for going away to college.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SO SICK"")

NE-YO: (Singing) And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears, so done with...

ROTH: I had stayed up all night just, like, having this really emotional nonstop goodbye. He left at, like, 4 in the morning, and I had to finish packing. And my mother and I drove to Carleton College in Minnesota. I had no sleep. I was, like, swollen from crying (laughter) all night. And it was supposed to be this adventure, but I was exhausted. And it was then that I knew that this was not a good relationship to be in. But I was very stubborn, so I kind of stuck it out for a really long time.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BLACK HORSE AND THE CHERRY TREE"")

KT TUNSTALL: (Singing) Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself so I'm going to let it do all the talking, woohoo, whoohoo...

ROTH: I started to develop feelings for someone else. And I went to my pastor and I told him I was overcome with guilt, and he was like, OK. Well, let's put that aside for a second. Let's talk about your relationship. What are the things that you love to do when you're not with him? And I told him that I liked to have deep conversations and I like to read and I didn't like to watch TV that much. And it just suddenly occurred to me that the person I was in the relationship was not the same person that I was outside of the relationship. And I liked the person I was outside of it, and so an hour later I ended the relationship.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BLACK HORSE AND THE CHERRY TREE"")

TUNSTALL: (Singing) You're not the one for me, woohoo, not the one for me...

ROTH: After that, I felt really weird for a while because all the things that I had said that I liked or didn't like seem so tied to that relationship. It was like I was completely blank and rediscovering everything. And so I'd be out with people and they'd be like, oh, do you, you know, something as simple as like do you like seafood? And I'd be like, you know what? I don't know (laughter). Let's try it. So I don't know, let's try it became, like, the new motto of my life. And it was the most exciting and most wonderful time.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ROTH: When I think back, I feel shame, to be honest, because I think to think of yourself as the kind of young woman who allows herself to be controlled by a relationship, that's something that makes you feel like you've failed as a feminist or, you know, failed as a woman. But that was a reality for me. I didn't know how to navigate this relationship. I didn't know that it was unhealthy.

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three — the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats — if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed — often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle — for example, surviving an air crash — that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place — or a small space like a lifeboat — with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there."

Veronica Roth is the best-selling author of ""Divergent."" For our ""Next Chapter"" series, she talks about a relationship that consumed her life and how she finally left it behind.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Throughout August, we're bringing you stories and advice from authors who've written for young people about that pivotal moment where they have left home and set out on their own. It's a series we call Next Chapter. Today, we hear from Veronica Roth. She's the author of the best-selling young adult sci-fi series ""Divergent,"" though that's not what she says when she meets people.

VERONICA ROTH: Usually, when I introduce myself at schools, I just say I'm Veronica. I write books.

SIMON: Veronica Roth came of age in the mid-aughts in a suburb of Chicago.

ROTH: One of those towns that I feel like they based the movie ""Mean Girls"" off of (laughter). Like a - like a highly competitive educational environment but also, like, a good place to live.

(SOUNDBITE OF NE-YO SONG, ""SO SICK"")

ROTH: The story of my leaving home is kind of inextricably tied to my high school boyfriend.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SO SICK"")

NE-YO: Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do (ph).

ROTH: He was staying around my town. He was going to community college in the area, and I was leaving. I was going to Minnesota. I was about to leave, and he was really upset with me for going away to college.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SO SICK"")

NE-YO: (Singing) And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears, so done with...

ROTH: I had stayed up all night just, like, having this really emotional nonstop goodbye. He left at, like, 4 in the morning, and I had to finish packing. And my mother and I drove to Carleton College in Minnesota. I had no sleep. I was, like, swollen from crying (laughter) all night. And it was supposed to be this adventure, but I was exhausted. And it was then that I knew that this was not a good relationship to be in. But I was very stubborn, so I kind of stuck it out for a really long time.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BLACK HORSE AND THE CHERRY TREE"")

KT TUNSTALL: (Singing) Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself so I'm going to let it do all the talking, woohoo, whoohoo...

ROTH: I started to develop feelings for someone else. And I went to my pastor and I told him I was overcome with guilt, and he was like, OK. Well, let's put that aside for a second. Let's talk about your relationship. What are the things that you love to do when you're not with him? And I told him that I liked to have deep conversations and I like to read and I didn't like to watch TV that much. And it just suddenly occurred to me that the person I was in the relationship was not the same person that I was outside of the relationship. And I liked the person I was outside of it, and so an hour later I ended the relationship.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BLACK HORSE AND THE CHERRY TREE"")

TUNSTALL: (Singing) You're not the one for me, woohoo, not the one for me...

ROTH: After that, I felt really weird for a while because all the things that I had said that I liked or didn't like seem so tied to that relationship. It was like I was completely blank and rediscovering everything. And so I'd be out with people and they'd be like, oh, do you, you know, something as simple as like do you like seafood? And I'd be like, you know what? I don't know (laughter). Let's try it. So I don't know, let's try it became, like, the new motto of my life. And it was the most exciting and most wonderful time.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ROTH: When I think back, I feel shame, to be honest, because I think to think of yourself as the kind of young woman who allows herself to be controlled by a relationship, that's something that makes you feel like you've failed as a feminist or, you know, failed as a woman. But that was a reality for me. I didn't know how to navigate this relationship. I didn't know that it was unhealthy. So I think extending the same mercy and kindness to yourself that you do to your friends and your family, I think that's a huge thing.

In some situations and before some interviews, it is very important to make sure the people we’re speaking to have agreed to let us use their names and that they understand our reports — and their names — will “live” on digital platforms, in theory at least, forever.

We’ve discussed this before, in posts about:

- How To Explain Why We Won’t ‘Take Down’ A Story.

- ‘This Story About You Is Going To Be On The Web Forever And You May Come To Regret That.’

Right here, we’ll stop to state what should be obvious: This is not about situations where it isn’t safe or practical to have a detailed conversation about the difference between NPR’s broadcast and digital platforms. Don’t stop running from the gunshots to discuss the fact that the story’s going on NPR.org as well. Also, this isn’t about interviews with public officials, corporate executives and others who are familiar with how the media works.

This is mostly about sensitive stories (chronic health issues; addictions; criminal histories; hate crimes; etc.) during which someone has expressed concern about being identified or we know that how we’re going to ID them requires careful thought. This is also often about stories involving minors.

Be sure it’s clear to people in such situations that we’re more than a radio network. You’d be surprised how often people still don’t realize that what we do goes on to various platforms.

Having them on tape acknowledging it’s OK to use their names is ideal. If there’s a discussion about some type of anonymity, follow the guidance on:

- The ‘don’ts’ of anonymity.

- A supervisor decides if anonymous news is shared.

- Whether To Go With ‘First-Name-Only’ Needs To Be Discussed And Explained.

- Our word is binding.

Getting this right is in line with one of our core principles: Respect.

Getting it right will also make it less likely that in later months or years someone will ask us to remove them from a story because “I didn’t say you could use my name.” If you ever receive such a request, by the way, don’t immediately reply. Forward it to your supervisor and the Standards & Practices editor.

Several times we have said the so-called bathroom bill in North Carolina is about whether transgender people should be able “to use the public bathrooms of their choice.”

In this case, “choice” is a loaded word. Proponents of laws restricting bathroom access to the sex on someone’s birth certificate say transgender people want to “choose” which bathroom to use, which also implies that being transgender is a “choice.” But transgender people say choice isn’t involved; that that this is about people using the bathrooms that match the genders they identify with. They say being transgender is who they are, not a choice.

We look for neutral language. One way to talk about this subject is to say it’s a debate over whether transgender people should be allowed to use public bathrooms “based on their gender identities or, instead, what’s stated on their birth certificates.”

As for “gender identity,” the National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association defines it as “an individual’s emotional and psychological sense of having a gender; feeling like a man, woman, both or neither (gender nonconformity). Does not necessarily align with an individual’s sex at birth.”

We’re going to be using “gender identity” again. It could help our audience understand the phrase if we take a moment when possible to explain it, perhaps simply as “the way we feel about ourselves.”

Paleontologists at the University of New South Wales in Australia say they have identified a tiny new species of marsupial lion that lived around 18 million years ago.

The extinct, squirrel-size animal weighed about 1.3 pounds, very likely lived in trees and had teeth that suggest it was capable of ripping apart other small creatures with its molars.

The researchers named it Microleo attenboroughi in honor of Sir David Attenborough, the famed British naturalist who has hosted numerous documentaries on wildlife.

As the researchers write in their study, published in the online journal Palaeontologia Electronica, the etymology of the name is:

""From micro meaning small (Greek) and leo meaning lion (Latin). The species name honors Sir David Attenborough for his dedication and enthusiasm in promoting the natural history of the world and the palaeontological treasures of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in particular.""

M. attenboroughi is the ninth, and smallest, marsupial lion species paleontologists have identified from fossils recovered at the Riversleigh World Heritage fossil site in Queensland, Australia. The first such species, Thylacoleo carnifex, which was identified in 1858 and more fully described in 1999, was much larger than the newly identified ""micro lion."" T. carnifex was about 5 feet long, 2 feet tall, and had the impressive ability to rip through prey with its jaws.

On its website, the Australian Museum describes T. carnifex's bite as ""the most powerful bite of any mammalian predator, living or extinct"" and says ""it could have taken prey much larger than itself.""

The other species range in size from that of a leopard down to the size of a dog. Over time, Australian marsupial lions grew in size, from the Miocene period, when the newly discovered lion species lived, up to the Pleistocene period, when T. carnifex hunted. At any given point over about 5 million years, no more than two species of Australian marsupial lion existed at the same time.

Marsupial lions are not the ancestors of modern lions living in parts of Africa, though they are related to modern marsupials such as koalas. The term ""lion"" refers instead to the status of the ancient hunters as dangerous carnivores, much like the current status of big cats.

M. attenboroughi is not alone in its honorific name among the prehistoric marsupial lions of Australia.

There's also Whollydooleya tomnpatrichorum, another recently discovered species. That animal, which is slightly larger than Attenborough's namesake and has sharper teeth, was discovered at a fossil site called Wholly Dooley. Its name pays tribute to Australian paleontologists Tom and Pat Rich."

As part of NPR's ""Book Your Trip"" series, TV critic Eric Deggans looks at a different kind of summertime journey, described in two books that became TV shows: PBS's documentary Freedom Summer, debuting tonight, and The Hallmark Channel's The Watsons Go to Birmingham.

When I was a kid in the mid-1970s, friends around my Indiana hometown talked about summers ""down South"" like they were heading to Disney World.

The trip was an annual, comforting ritual for black families up North with roots in the Deep South.

But there was a time, just a decade earlier, when traveling down South could mean taking your life in your hands if you were black.

""Spending a summer in Mississippi taught me a lot about this country,"" says volunteer Karin Kunstler in the first moments of PBS's American Experience documentary Freedom Summer. ""My high school social studies teacher taught me that we all have rights. Mississippi summer taught me that we didn't all have rights.""

Watch a Preview of 'Freedom Summer' PBS YouTube

Kunstler was one of more than 700 mostly white student volunteers who headed to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 to challenge segregation. Freedom Summer tells the tumultuous, emotional story of that journey, using archival photos and fresh interviews with the participants to re-create one of the most dangerous summertime trips of that time.

Volunteers rode buses from Ohio to Mississippi, where they would live with black families scattered throughout the state.

At first, they felt a joyous excitement known as a ""freedom high,"" says Freedom Summer author Bruce Watson. But then, reality hit home.

""There was a lot of singing, a lot of freedom songs being sung on the bus, until they reached Mississippi,"" Watson says. ""And then, in most cases, the buses were met at the state line by highway patrolmen, who had known, of course, that they were coming. And many volunteer[s] told me that at that point, when they crossed the line, the singing stopped and it got very serious from then on.""

Once in Mississippi, volunteers faced another journey, learning to live in the crushing poverty and strict segregation suffered by their hosts.

""It's 100 years of Jim Crow ... that insisted that black people defer to whites in a way that was really shocking to everyone from the North,"" says Watson. ""Black people had to get off the sidewalk if a white person approached; black people were never called by Mr. or Mrs., they were always called by their first name or just 'boy.' All of these things, the degradation and poverty, was really startling to the volunteers, even though they had been told about it.""

Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia in Congress, was a law student in 1964 who helped develop training programs for Freedom Summer volunteers.

""It's very different, even for a black kid ... going [down South] in '63 or '64,"" says Norton. ""Because then you're going with the civil rights movement in hand. So you're going critical of the environment ... which is something you might not have done in the 1950s.""

Norton also saw racist violence up close, when she tried to rescue noted activist Fannie Lou Hamer from a Mississippi jail.

""When I asked to see Miss Hamer, this storied woman leader of the civil rights movement in the South that she was to become, she had been beaten unmercifully by a black trusty,"" she says. ""And [the white prison guards] told him, if you don't beat her [hard enough], we'll see just how you beat her and we're going to beat you even harder.""

But even the worst violence, the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, didn't keep volunteers away.

For a less violent, more personal journey, viewers can watch the Hallmark Channel's adaptation of The Watsons Go to Birmingham. It's a story about an unassuming black family caught up in the civil rights struggle while visiting relatives in Alabama — a perfect metaphor for the bitttersweet experience of traveling south back then, according to the book's author, Christopher Paul Curtis.

""When people would discuss about going south, there would be almost this idyllic tone to what they were saying,"" Curtis says. ""And you know that's not quite true, when people are being lynched and you can't have certain jobs and take care of things like that. But I think it's human nature ... [to] gloss over the bad things and remember the good.""

In one scene, the parents must tell their children how rules for travel are different in the deep South than in their Michigan hometown, noting they'll be traveling during daylight and exercising care about where they make rest stops.

Curtis says he based such scenes on information he got from older relatives who once traveled in the segregated South. ""When African-American people would travel from the North to the South, you had to do a lot of planning beforehand,"" he adds. ""There were actually books that told black people where they could stop, that gave restaurants that were either black owned or would serve black people.""

The contrast between both shows is telling. The Hallmark Channel movie features a family who joins the civil rights struggle, almost by accident. PBS's Freedom Summer shows volunteers who deliberately challenged injustice.

But both TV programs also depict another important journey: how the nation was led away from segregation by people willing to take a dangerous stand for equality."

Like hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing the long war back home, 25-year-old Firas Awad endured a dangerous sea journey and a long trek through much of Europe to reach Germany, where he's staked his future.

He and his 18-year-old wife, Tamam Aldrawsha, who are both from the city of Homs, now live in what used to be a country inn and restaurant, in a tiny, forested village north of Berlin called Klosterheide, population 280.

Eighty-eight asylum seekers moved here last December. Fewer than 60 remain, most of them men in their 20s and 30s. They spend nearly six hours a day studying German in the hopes that they can someday work in professional fields such as medicine and pharmaceuticals or learn crafts like carpentry and auto repair.

Awad hopes that in three years, maximum, he will speak German well enough to finish his pharmacy studies and get a job. Then, just maybe, he says, the people who sometimes glare at him on the bus will accept him.

""The other people have to respect me because I'll be working here, I will support this country like German people,"" he says.

We walk to his room, which he calls ""mein kleines Haus"" or ""my little house."" It's paid for by the district government of Ostprignitz-Ruppin, which leases the inn.

Aldrawsha, his wife, is inside, studying German verbs. She wants to be a nurse. She shows me a wall above their small refrigerator that's covered with yellow Post-it notes with German words and phrases. One reads ""Wir moechten gesellshaf reinkommen"" — an attempt in German to say, ""We want to be part of society.""

""I want to be useful. Useful for my family and useful for this country,"" she says. ""Integration shouldn't be measured by whether I wear this headscarf,"" she adds, pointing to the deep sea-blue hijab covering her hair. ""It should be measured by whether I become a useful member of this society.""

Germany welcomed more than a million migrants last year, many of them war refugees from the Middle East. But Germans are growing increasingly pessimistic that these newcomers can be integrated into German society.

Their fears have been inflamed by the rise of a far-right Islamophobic party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which says migrants are criminals and that Islam is not compatible with the German constitution. A series of attacks last month, including two by asylum seekers, have also unnerved Germans, though polls show most don't see a connection between the attacks and refugees.

Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has seen her popularity wane because of her open-door policy for refugees, says Germany faces a historic task of integrating these largely Muslim newcomers.

""I am as convinced as ever that we can do it,"" she said last month.

But the task of actually convincing Germans that this can be done usually falls on the shoulders of local officials like Martin Osinski, who coordinates refugee housing in the area that includes Klosterheide, which is part of a nearby town, Lindow.

Whenever he plans the opening of a refugee shelter, he has a meeting with locals and spends hours answering their questions.

""And we always explained, there will be no rise of criminalism,"" he says. ""There will be no problems for the neighbors, except some more children crying around. And we invited people to have a look at our camps and to meet refugees and just to make [their] own experiences. This helps to get rid of anxiousness. As long as people made contact, it worked, it was OK. But those who don't try have no chance to correct their bad prejudices. No chance.""

Ingrid Huebner, a 65-year-old retired job counselor, and her 75-year-old husband, Wolfram, who used to work at a power plant, were among several Klosterheide residents who took Osinski up on his offer.

They say locals and the newcomers have picnicked together and worked on village beautification projects. The Huebners have befriended a Syrian-Kurdish family, whom they see at least once a week.

""We take them on excursions that we haven't gone on for years,"" Ingrid says. ""Meeting them has really enriched our lives.""

But other villagers have stayed away and remain wary. The refugee shelter's deputy manager, Angela Lipowski-Wallin, recalls how a rumor spread after the migrants took swimming lessons at the public pool.

""The refugees weren't staying in their lanes, so the locals here thought they weren't following the rules,"" she says. ""That quickly morphed into rumors that the refugees were harassing other swimmers.""

Around the corner from the shelter, Daniel Schultz, a short, stout 29-year-old former soldier, is replacing the bricks of his parents' big driveway.

He says he sometimes sees the migrants from the local shelter riding their bicycles around town, sometimes swerving into traffic.

""They're all really nice, and I've been to some bad parts of Afghanistan, so I know the terrible situation some of them are coming from,"" he says, wiping his brow. ""I'm not afraid of them. But there is fear among some that we can't predict who will become a terrorist and who will not.""

Down the street, a splinter-thin, middle-aged carpenter named Michael Ast is taking a break, eating plums picked right off his tree.

He says the migrants are kind and hardworking, but doubts many will end up with real jobs. There's too much to learn, he says, and it's not just the language. He tells the story of a young asylum-seeker from Chad that he hired as an apprentice.

""He was friendly, eager to help and had a good work ethic. He was always on time,"" Ast says. ""But when we tried to teach him, it didn't work out. We spent half a year trying to teach him what a cubic meter and a square meter were. He didn't even know that.""

The young man gave up and left town. Ast shakes his head.

""We were worlds apart,"" he says."

Just southwest of bustling Charleston, S.C., lies a lush and rural gem called Wadmalaw Island, one of the Sea Islands that dot the shoreline. This is the home of the Charleston Tea Plantation, the only commercial tea plantation in North America.

Here, 127 acres of gleaming dark green tea bushes unfold in endless rows, framed against light-green fields and silvery loops of Spanish moss that festoon the oak trees. With its sandy soils, subtropical climate and generous yearly rainfall of about 50 inches, Wadmalaw is an ideal home for tea.

Rather than planting tea seeds, the Charleston Tea Plantation grows cuttings in a nursery for four years. The fledgling bushes are descendants of the same Camellia sinensis plants that were first brought to the Carolinas in the 1700s by French botanist Andre Michaux.

The plantation is owned by the Bigelow Tea Co., in partnership with third-generation tea taster William Barclay Hall, a fellow with a magnificent passion for tea and the knowledge to match it.

I spoke with Hall about the tea business while sipping a cool cuppa and gazing out at the glimmering rows of tea plants flowing like green scarves to the horizon.

Your grandfather and father were professional tea tasters. How did you become one, too?

My father suggested I go into tea. Back then you had to have family connections to be trained. London was the center of the world trade in tea at the time, and every week teas were sent to London to be auctioned off. I tasted as many as 800 teas a day, five days a week. The goal was to be able to blind taste 10 teas and identify each one's country and region of origin, and even the tea plant used.

Were those many hundreds of cups of teas simply laid out for tasting?

About 80 were laid out at a time, on long benches. You would taste them all along with a buyer, then everything would be cleaned up and 80 more teas would be laid out.

Though there is only one tea plant, Camellia sinensis, there are thousands of varieties. But they don't have names like Golden Delicious or Granny Smith — they have numbers. Believe it or not, all of the teas become individual to you. We have a special terminology for tea that ... is hard to convey to an outsider. We might say, ""This tea has good character."" Well, what does character taste like? Or ""This tea is out of condition, that one is bright, that one is brisk, and this one is burnt.""

Those descriptors are very important, because tea is one of the few commodities in the world bought and sold strictly on taste. And what makes teas so interesting, as opposed to, say, grapes, is that tea is harvested every 15-18 days. Grapes are harvested once a year — and you either have a good, bad or indifferent year. But tea is changing all the time. Is it too hot or cold this month? Is it the beginning, middle or end of the season? Did we have too much rain? All this influences the flavor of the tea.

Tell us a little about how you grow the teas here.

We don't use any pesticide, herbicides or fungicides. Tea is naturally pest resistant, because the caffeine and tannins repel insects. We use a custom irrigation system. We plant the bushes in long rows, very close together, with just enough space between the rows for the mechanical harvester to fit. That way, very little light filters down between the rows, and very few weeds or random tea seeds sprout. We dry the leaves on ""withering box"" screens for 18 hours, then macerate them in a grinder. I then steep and taste and blend each batch until it tastes just right.

You live on the property full time. How do you like it?

What could be better than a life centered around tea? Nothing, absolutely nothing. People all over the world start and end their days with tea. It's hardy, lives hundreds of years, requires no tilling of the soil and you can plant 5,200 oxygen-producing plants in every acre. It's healthy for you. I love it here so much that I will eat everything out of my refrigerator, even down to my last jar of mayonnaise, before I leave the plantation and go to the city to shop for food. Tea is the greatest crop in the world.

Tea Tuesdays is an occasional series exploring the science, history, culture and economics of this ancient brewed beverage.

I'll never forget the first time I heard punk music. I was young, growing up in a country on the verge of collapse. One afternoon, I needed to buy some tights for gymnastics, and the nearest place that sold them was a record store near my house. I walked in feeling terribly uncool — a bit intimidated by the T-shirts adorned with skulls and big bold letters, depicting bands I'd never heard before. I was taken aback by the most raucous, disrespectful, cocky, angry, beautiful sound I'd ever heard. What is that? I asked the clerk. That, I was told, was The Sex Pistols. I'd never heard music that described so deeply everything I was feeling, and everything that was happening around me.

Over the years, I discovered that punk wasn't just emaciated white guys mouthing off in English, although I never stopped loving the Pistols. There were also women, African Americans and Latinos, and they sung in all languages, including my own. But they all had a certain kind of rebelliousness in common: an attitude, a fight for survival and a wicked sense of humor.

This week on Alt.Latino, we have the pleasure of speaking to a group of women who embody new punk, musically and culturally. The band Fea is Latina punk at its finest, featuring members of Girl In A Coma and with a new album co-produced by legendary rocker Alice Bag. Its songs are about issues that often get brushed off: what it means to be a young Latina in the U.S. today, beauty standards, the role of women. Tune in as we tackle those topics and more."

Motorcycles provide an open road for literature — literally and figuratively. They're sometimes the dramatic device writers use to talk about many things: adventure, rebellion, even inner peace. But motorcycles aren't just a metaphor at Bartel's Harley-Davidson shop in Marina Del Rey, Calif. They're loud and shiny and very real.

More on the Book Your Trip series For more great cycling tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

This is where we find Jeff Bragg, who claims he has been riding since he was 3. He reads an excerpt from Hunter S. Thompson's book Hell's Angels: ""Tense for the action, long hair in the wind, beards and bandanas flapping, earrings, armpits, chains, whips, swastikas and stripped-down Harleys flashing chrome as traffic on 101 moves over, nervous, to let the formation pass like a burst of dirty thunder.""

In literature, motorcycles — and the people who ride them — often represent an outlaw spirit, danger and sex. For motorcyclist Allie MacKenzie, that's a no-brainer. ""Who in their right mind can pass up a bad boy on a bike?"" MacKenzie rides a Harley Sportster Forty-Eight. At Bartel's, she picks a passage from the book Motorcycle Man by Kristen Ashley: ""I was panting, and he was cursing. It was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me. If he would have asked me to, I would have jumped on the back of his bike and ridden to the ends of the Earth with him.""

On the opposite end of the motorcycle fascination spectrum sits Matthew B. Crawford. By his own description, he's in the ""knowledge industry."" He has a Ph.D. and has worked at think tanks. He also owns his own motorcycle repair shop in Richmond, Va., and he's the author of Shop Class as Soulcraft — a manifesto for the importance of working with one's own hands. Fixing, restoring and riding motorcycles, he says, is very different from writing about them.

Writing ... is like pulling teeth ... it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking — which is kind of the routine experience on a bike.

""Writing-with-a-T is like pulling teeth,"" he says, enunciating the ""t"" sound. ""There are moments of pleasure when you feel like you've really nailed it. But it's this activity where I have to force myself to sit and go over something over and over again to try to get it right, and it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking — which is kind of the routine experience on a bike, especially when there's like heavy traffic that's moving fast and there's all these obstacles. All of your senses are just keyed in and kind of hyper alert, so it's a very heightened state of consciousness.""

That state is what Rachel Kushner captures in her novel The Flamethrowers: ""I was going one hundred miles an hour now, trying to steer properly from my hunched position as insects ticked and thumped and splatted against the windscreen. It was suicide to let the mind drift,"" she reads.

Kushner's protagonist, Reno, races through the desert trying to break a land-speed record. ""She's in the moment, very present to it, because she doesn't want to crash,"" says Kushner. ""I wrote it based on, to some degree, my own experience. I know what it's like to go very fast on motorcycles. Those moments, they stay with you.""

In literature, motorcycle trips are sometimes an escape, a way to chase away a bad marriage, a midlife crisis. A more profoundly political coming-of-age ride took place in 1952, when a 23-year-old, pre-revolutionary Che Guevara set off from Buenos Aires with a friend on the back of a Norton 500 to explore South America. Guevara's book The Motorcycle Diaries was published in 1993, years after his death, and was later turned into a movie.

""These two young men with a shared love of adventure, of women, of speed, and this bike, and this shared political yearning,"" says journalist Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Anderson says the seven- or eight-month motorcycle trip was really a coming of age for medical student Guevara and his friend.

""The idea [was] that they needed to see something of their continent beyond the rather privileged confines of their Argentina, their white Argentina,"" says Anderson. ""They took off on this bike and traveled through the indigenous and mestizo back roads and backwoods of their continent. It was an extraordinary experience for young Guevara. It really was a determinant in his life, deciding what he would become.""



The Norton broke down, as motorcycles will — but even that experience can take you someplace, a phenomenon Robert Pirsig examines in his now classic 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

""When you get stuck on fixing motorcycles, that's not a bad moment. That's actually a pretty good moment,"" he told NPR in 1974. ""The times I've been stuck, I've been able to catch myself at being stuck and, instead of getting mad, just gone off and had a cup of coffee. And I notice whenever I'm stuck like that, that if I look at the clouds, the clouds are much more beautiful. I find at the very moment of stuckness, if you just stop and look around you, you find the world is very real.""

Back at Bartel's, biker Ron Hamberg reads from Zen, a moment in which Pirsig contrasts riding a motorcycle with the more passive act of driving in a car. In a car, Pirsig writes, ""you're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame. On a cycle, the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore. And the sense of presence is overwhelming.""

Hamberg — covered with tattoos — rides a Harley. He says he has read books by Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Mahatma Gandhi. But as for books about motorcycles, he growls, ""I just ride 'em. I don't read about 'em."""
2015-02-18 00:00:00,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/18/8055691/transgender-transgendered-tnr,"Why you should always use ""transgender"" instead of ""transgendered""",[u'German Lopez'],"[u'woman', u'terms', u'readers', u'gender', u'transgendered', u'right', u'word', u'instead', u'transgender', u'trans', u'man']","Questions of language are deeply ingrained in the fight for transgender rights and equality. It's not just a matter of being polite. If someone calls a trans man a woman, it fundamentally cuts against the person's gender identity.

But there are still big barriers, even among traditionally liberal media outlets, toward getting the basics of trans-inclusive vocabulary right. A recent story in the New Republic referred to trans people as ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwomen"" — all of which are offensive to many trans people.

BuzzFeed LGBT Editor Saeed Jones echoed some of the offense in a recent tweet:

Also, it’s ""transgender,"" not ""transgendered."" ""Transgendered"" is the linguistic equivalent of describing someone as ""blacked."" — Saeed Jones (@theferocity) February 17, 2015

Getting this right isn't just a matter of being inclusive toward trans people, although that should be reason enough. It can also help readers become familiar with the correct terms.

As New York Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan explained last week, one of the major challenges for news outlets is that most readers just aren't familiar with how to correctly refer to people with non-traditional gender identities. And in some cases, referring to someone with the correct terms can be a little confusing — calling Chelsea Manning, a transgender soldier who's in prison for leaking secret US documents, ""she"" after years of addressing her in news stories as ""he"" may have confused some readers, even though using the correct pronoun for Manning is the right editorial call.

Of course, there are ways around this. A writer could explain what the terms mean within a story. News outlets could link readers to clear definitions, similar to what BuzzFeed does with its house style guide. Stories could also point readers to more in-depth glossaries, like the GLAAD Media Reference Guide or UC Berkeley Gender Equity Resource Center's definition of terms.

Most importantly, media outlets have to first get the terms right for themselves. But two common mistakes persist, as seen in the New Republic's use of the terms ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwoman."" Here's why those terms are not just inaccurate but can cause such great offense when they're used.

Transgender vs. transgendered

The umbrella term for people who identify with a gender different than the one assigned to them at birth is ""transgender"" or ""trans."" These words are adjectives, not nouns. Additionally, the word ""transgendered"" is offensive to trans people and unnecessarily confusing.

As trans advocate Joanne Herman noted in the Huffington Post, calling someone transgendered is a bit like calling someone ""colored."" ""One problem with this label was that it implied something happened to make the person 'of color,' which denied the person's dignity of being born that way,"" Herman wrote. Similarly, transgendered suggests that being trans is something that happens to someone, as opposed to an identity someone is born with.

The implication behind transgendered flies in the face of science: people can know their gender identity at a very young age. A recent study from the TransYouth Project found that transgender children as young as five years old respond to psychological gender-association tests, which evaluate how people view themselves within gender roles, as quickly and consistently as those who don't identify as trans.

Transgendered is also unnecessarily long and confusing. LGBT group GLAAD explained: ""The adjective transgender should never have an extraneous '-ed' tacked onto the end. An '-ed' suffix adds unnecessary length to the word and can cause tense confusion and grammatical errors. It also brings transgender into alignment with lesbian, gay, and bisexual. You would not say that Elton John is 'gayed' or Ellen DeGeneres is 'lesbianed,' therefore you would not say Chaz Bono is 'transgendered.'""

Trans men and trans women vs. transmen and transwomen

A trans man is someone who identifies as a man but was designated female at birth. A trans woman is someone who identifies as a woman but was designated male at birth. Some trans people prefer to leave the word transgender or trans out altogether, since they only identify as a man or woman.

Writers shouldn't use ""transman"" or ""transwoman."" The word trans is an adjective that helps describe someone's gender identity, and it should be treated like other adjectives. Merging the adjective and the noun risks suggesting that a trans man or woman is more (or less) than just a man or just a woman, which goes against how many trans people identify themselves.

At the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, a building named for one of the country’s most staunch advocates for the war on drugs, Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush — the son of another drug war backer — stated on national television that he had smoked marijuana. He didn’t give any qualifications; he didn’t claim to have disliked it, done only it once or not inhaled (though he did apologize to his mother).

More noteworthy, Bush and other leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination used the debate stage to call for criminal justice reform. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina was perhaps the most strident, noting that the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Libertarian favorite Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul sharply but expectedly called for more rehabilitation and less incarceration for drug crimes, and other candidates, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Bush, touted the benefits of drug courts and treatment as an alternative to incarceration. Christie called the war on drugs a “failure.” Implicit in this discussion was not only agreement that we have too many people in prison but also a competition for the most effective solution.

On the other side of the political spectrum, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley are beginning to unveil their criminal justice plans. Clinton called for an end to mass incarceration in her first speech as a candidate. Just last week, Sanders unveiled a plan to ban private prisons and reinstate federal parole.

This is an encouraging change from past presidential elections. At least since Richard Nixon’s 1968 campaign, politicians have tried to outdo one another as to who could be harder on crime and criminals. Perhaps most infamously, George H.W. Bush‘s Willie Horton ad helped secure his election by pushing the narrative that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was to blame for the release of a violent criminal into society. The ad sealed into conventional wisdom that politicians must be tough on crime to win elections.

This logic wasn’t unique to conservatives. Bill Clinton promised harsh responses to crime during his 1992 campaign and delivered two years later with his crime bill, a piece of legislation that contributed to today’s mass incarceration problem by giving states billions of dollars to increase their prison populations and expanding federal three-strikes and mandatory minimum laws. By now, even Clinton has stated that the bill “made the [mass incarceration] problem worse.”"

Sept. 15 is the deadline for committing to a bid. Paris; Hamburg, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; and Rome are going neck and neck, banking on the games’ promise to bolster local economies. Boston, however, dropped its bid on Monday after Mayor Martin J. Walsh refused “to put city taxpayers on the hook” for cost overruns if the organizers ran out of cash.

Much of the discussion about hosting the Olympic Games is filled with hyperbole. Boston Olympic boosters were portraying the games as a potent economic development opportunity and a chance to confer world-class status on the city. But the games’ real economic effects are clearer than ever. Every Olympics since 1960 has gone over budget, by an average of 179 percent. The extravagant bash has nearly bankrupted some previous host cities. It took Montreal 30 years to pay off its $1.5 billion debt from the 1976 games. Nagano, Japan, fell into a recession after hosting the 1998 Winter Olympics.

As previous Olympic hosts groan under the weight of debt and struggle to maintain expensive, empty venues, it’s time for the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which organizes the games, to reel the expenses back in. Beyond the massive debt burdens, the games have left behind tarnished reputations for host nations. Greece’s decaying venues from the 2004 Olympics have become apt metaphors for the country’s economic crisis. Viewers are likely to remember for a long time Sochi´s yellow tap water and communal toilets during the 2014 Olympics in Russia.

Boston’s decision to withdraw its bid underscores the growing awareness of the costs and burdens of hosting the Olympics. And yet over-the-top rhetoric about the games’ benefits continues. Paris’ Mayor Anne Hidalgo had said the games could leave “a major ecological legacy,” promising to make the Seine clean enough to host the triathlon’s swimming leg. Rome’s bid president, Luca di Montezemolo, is touting the Olympics as “an opportunity for growth and investment for the whole country.”Doubters are offered the examples of the profitable 1984 games in Los Angeles, which may now replace Boston in the U.S. Olympic Committee’s 2024 bid, or the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, without any context on the evolution of the hosting requirements and the divergent economic realities.

Rio de Janeiro is gearing up to host the 2016 Olympic Games. Rio’s candidacy in 2009 underlined the belief in the Olympics’ power to bestow global approval on a city.

It comes off like your mother ending a text with “LOL.” It doesn’t sound cool; it sounds out of touch. That’s just what I thought perusing the website of Mixify, a new marketing campaign by the American Beverage Association (ABA).

Launched earlier this year, Mixify promotes balance in what you “eat, drink and do.” Mixify, according to the site, is “like a balance wingman.” (Who knew balance needs a wingman?) “Balance” is defined as “crossing cats with dragons”; finding it will keep you “feeling snazzier than the emoji of the dancing lady in red.” Honestly, I’m not even sure exactly what that is supposed to mean, but you get the idea. It’s all about communicating that, dear (youthful) reader, we’re hip, we’re cool, we’re one of you — and we don’t want you to be worried about drinking our beverages.

As the beverage industry trade association, the ABA spends tens of millions of dollars every year to promote its members’ interests, from fighting taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to stopping initiatives to get soda out of schools to pushing marketing campaigns such as this one. (It spent $62.5 million in 2013 alone.) Mixify is just one tactic it is deploying to try to fix a core image problem.

As part of this massive campaign — including interactive social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram — Mixify is hitting the road with free events for teens in more than half a dozen cities around the country this summer. So what’s the problem with a little summer fun, a little “silent disco” in D.C. or outdoor games at a football field in Philly?

The problem is that soda is not innocuous. Sugar-sweetened beverages are tied to the biggest public health epidemic of our time: rising rates of diet-related illnesses.

Public relations campaigns such as these are designed to deflect concerns from a culprit of ill health — drinking soda — by promoting balance. Lori Dorfman, the head of the Berkeley Media Studies Group, noted the parallels between this strategy and the alcohol industry’s promotion of designated drivers: “Those campaigns actually promoted drinking. Some people called them designated drinker programs because they gave people permission to drink to excess if they weren’t driving — as if drinking and driving were the only problems related to alcohol,” she said. “Many alcohol companies created their own campaigns to look like good guys, but all their slogans encouraged drinking and never suggested that a designated driver should have nothing to drink, with slogans like ‘Think when you drink’ and ‘Know when to say when.’”

The parallels between sugar-sweetened beverage marketing such as Mixify and Big Tobacco public relations are also striking, as Dorfman and others write in a recent paper in PLOS Medicine (PDF). Like the tobacco industry before it, the sugar-sweetened beverage industry is employing “elaborate, expensive, multinational corporate social responsibility campaigns,” they write. “These campaigns echo the tobacco industry’s use of [such campaigns] as a means to focus responsibility on consumers rather than on the corporation, bolster the companies’ and their products’ popularity and to prevent regulation.”"

Small farmers in Central America harvest their crops at the end of two planting seasons, the first between May and August and the second from September to December. For 2015, the World Food Organization estimated that corn production from the first planting season would drop 8 percent, adding to an already dire situation given crop losses the previous year.

In Guatemala, 80 percent of the first season crops in the Dry Corridor were lost, affecting 154,000 families. El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua reported corn production dropoffs in excess of 60 percent.

The Sandinista government of Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega is sending 40,000 packages of food aid to the affected areas within his country, but civil society organizations such as Caritas, a Catholic relief organization, have said it isn’t enough. They want the government to elevate the situation to a national emergency. Caritas Nicaragua issued an international call to action to raise funds to help the poorest families.

“Sixty-five percent of small farmers are affected,” explained Agustin Alvarado, coordinator of emergencies and risk management for Caritas Nicaragua. “They produce most of our food but are not being adequately attended to.”

“The government is minimizing the situation,” he added. “What is going to happen to these people?”

Centro Humboldt, a Managua-based environmental NGO that has 92 monitoring stations in the Dry Corridor, says annual rainfall there averaged 1.3 meters before the latest El Niño phenomenon, but has dropped to 0.5 meters since 2013.

“It is no longer raining in the first months of the year,” said Abel Garcia, who heads the organization’s risk assessment office. “Between July and August, it normally rains at least 11 days, but last year it rained only three.”

To make matters worse, the rains have become more irregular; making it difficult for farmers to know when to sow their seeds.

“It rains too little or too much all at once,” Garcia said. This causes the topsoil to erode, which forces farmers to spend more on fertilizers or risk losing their crops altogether.

“This year has been terrible,” said Rosa Maria Urroz, who lives in the small rural community of Lechecuagos, just 57 miles northwest of Managua. She said it’s the worst drought she has lived through in her 38 years, and that blinding dust clouds are increasingly common

“There is so much dust, we can’t see anything,” she said, adding that her family is more susceptible to respiratory illnesses.

Since they don’t own land, the family rents about 20 acres to plant sesame, which they sell at the end of each planting season. Their livelihood depends on their ability to reinvest their earnings into other activities, like buying and selling animals.

“Before I used to kill a pig every Saturday to sell the meat, and now I don’t have money to buy animals,” Urroz said. She estimates her family lost 80 percent of the crops they planted last year.

They used to also harvest the tamarind pods that grow in their backyard, but the drought eliminated that crop as well.

This year they will diversify their crops by planting squash along with the sesame. “In the western part of the country we can no longer plant corn,” she said. “We are planting plants more resistant to the drought, such as squash, but there is so much of it that prices have dropped.”"

An African-American president with a diverse lineage would, we imagined, lead the United States to a less prejudiced future. In the run-up to the 2016 primary season, I have been proved wrong. The media coverage after Carson’s and Trump’s statements reveals why. Just as in the early days of Obama’s 2008 campaign, when he was first being accused of being a Muslim, media outlets remain focused on expiating him of being Muslim rather than taking on the core issue of whether being Muslim is bad.

Sadly, the premise that being Muslim is a valid basis for questioning a candidate’s qualification for office is not new, even among Democrats. In 2008 in the heady days of Obama’s first presidential campaign, I signed up to canvass for him. A campaign organizer gave a pep talk to all the volunteers and went over the talking points the campaign was using. Then, just when everyone was about to get going, she added something that was not in the script printout we were all given. “Remember to emphasize the fact that Barack Obama is not a Muslim,” she said. As a Muslim, this exhortation stung, and — stunned — I canvassed still and listened to my partner following instructions and saying, “Vote for Obama” and “Obama is not Muslim.”

The measure of who can malign Muslims the most appears to have become a presidential qualification among Republican contenders. A CNN/ORC poll conducted Sept. 17 through 19 shows that after the GOP candidates’ debate that week, Trump lost 8 percentage points from his August lead and Carson fell from 19 percent to 14 percent. Their Islamophobic comments and omissions have once again catapulted them into the media limelight they crave. Smug at the success of their strategy, their staffers are hogging the airwaves, reiterating the rightness of maligning Muslims, once again holding American Muslims responsible for 9/11 and for any and every crime any Muslim anywhere may have committed. There are data to support this strategy . In the crucial primary state of Iowa, only 49 percent of Republicans think that Islam should even be legal in the United States, and 77 percent agree with Trump’s assertion that President Barack Obama is waging a war on Christianity, according to Public Policy Polling.

Of course, Carson is not the only Republican candidate capitalizing on popularity born of Islamophobia. Before him was Donald Trump, who was confronted with a follower at a town hall meeting in Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sept. 17 who said, “ We have a problem in this country. It’s called Muslims. You know our current president is one. You know he’s not even an American .” Trump, otherwise so bursting with bluster, did not bother to chastise the man, saying instead, “We’re going to be looking at that.”

“Are they going to kill us?” asked Ibrahim Noureldin’s son, a 7-year-old student at Selden’s Landing Elementary School in Leesburg, Virginia. He was watching GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson on “Meet the Press.” Sitting by his father, the boy heard Carson say, “ I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that. ” Born in the United States, the boy could not understand why a man on television would say that.

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most ideologically distant from the Carson and Trump camps, has also disappointed on Islamophobia. Asked about Trump’s statement, she dished out this specimen of empty vehemence: “He knew or he should have known that what that man was asking was not only way out of bounds, it was untrue.” she said. “He should have, from the beginning, repudiated that kind of rhetoric, that level of hatefulness.” What hatefulness, which bounds and what exactly was untrue she cleverly leaves up to the listener to figure out. Most American listeners, as used to Islamophobia as they are to smartphones, will miss the denunciation, if one is present at all. Clever as always, she sounds strong while ensuring that the Islamophobes in her own ranks feel no discomfort, no call to excise prejudice from their Democratic hearts. Not a single presidential contender, Clinton included, is ready to say what millions of American Muslims are eager to hear — that Muslims are not a problem and that being called a Muslim is not a slur.

On the Monday after Carson made his statement regarding Muslims and the presidency, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights group, held a press conference. Nihad Awad, its executive director, emphasized the words of Article VI of the Constitution, which says clearly that “no religious test” is required to contest public office in America. He asked Carson to apologize to American Muslims or withdraw his candidacy, in light of his overt opposition to the Constitution.

Neither, of course, is likely to happen; Carson’s campaign, so neglected in past weeks, is enjoying the glow of media attention, and Trump staffers are eager to remain under the cloud of controversy that has fueled his rise. However, the CAIR press conference and its overt demand for an apology indicate a more aggressive tone by Muslim American rights organizations than before. In the paranoid post-9/11 era, American Muslim groups have been fast and eager with denunciations, issuing them on the tracks of any and every act of terrorism or crime committed by any Muslim anywhere. However, instead of absolving American Muslims as a group from responsibility for these acts, they have instead achieved the opposite. Since 9/11, the percentage of Americans who have a favorable view of Muslims has fallen from 47 percent to 27 percent. An April poll conducted by the Huffington Post found that 55 percent of Americans surveyed said they have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Muslims.

While American Muslims have been apologizing for crimes to which they have no connection, an Islamophobic Republican Party has made hating them a cornerstone of its definition of patriotism, an accompaniment to its broader nativism. Candidates may get called out for not defending the president, but castigating American Muslims is entirely acceptable. To end the cycle, Muslim groups such as CAIR should no longer issue denunciations of grotesque acts of terrorism and focus instead on calling out the bigotry of American politicians.

Ibrahim Noureldin’s son later told his father that he did not want to be president at all. On the Monday after Carson’s statement, he refused to go to school. Noureldin found it hard to convince him otherwise. It was only one week after Texas high schooler Ahmed Mohamed was arrested for taking a clock to school; it is difficult to blame the boy for his reticence. Ahmed after all, is still being called a terrorist by some Republicans. With those aspiring to the highest political office in the United States being so brazenly bigoted, American Muslim children may be right in being fearful, in knowing that the American commitment to equality and fairness applies to everyone except them."

This admission highlights the regrettable conclusion of the Obama presidency’s Israel-Palestinian policy, which opened in 2009 with high expectations raised by the ill-conceived and ill-fated decision to put the demand for a settlement freeze at the top of his diplomatic agenda.

Obama quickly assembled a “dream team” to implement the settlement freeze, led by former Sen. George Mitchell, who brokered the historic Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, and who, as the head of the Mitchell Commission, in April 2001 called on Israel to “freeze all settlement activity, including the ‘natural growth’ of existing settlements.”

In 2009 then–Secretary of State Hillary Clinton set the uncompromising terms of U.S. policy, declaring that Obama “wants to see a stop to settlements — not some settlements, not outposts, not ‘natural growth’ exceptions ... That is our position. That is what we have communicated very clearly.”

But Obama’s insistence on a settlement freeze failed spectacularly, convincing Israel’s combative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could successfully oppose not only the demand to end settlement expansion but also Obama’s broader diplomatic program.

Fast-forward to 2015 and the recent meeting between Obama and Netanyahu, in which the U.S. surrender to Netanyahu’s West Bank agenda was finalized.

“A two-state solution was not going to happen while President Obama was still in office, and … even the possibility of talks about a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians was unlikely over the course of the next 14 or 15 months,” said a White House spokesman afterward.

Having failed to produce a two-state solution, the White House now warns that it is up to the parties themselves to stop the slide to a one-state solution.

“The onus is on the Israelis and Palestinians to say what they are willing to do … not only safeguard the possibility of the two-state solution in the future but to show there are ways to move there,” National Security Council official Rob Malley said.

It is clear that U.S. officials view the prospect of a one-state solution as a stick — so unpalatable that it should spur Israel to stop its settlement efforts and loosen its security and economic grip in order to strengthen the Palestinian Authority and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas.

But what Obama and his team see as a calamity — uncontested Israeli control between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea — Israel sees as a victory. This fundamental mismatch is at the heart of Washington’s continuing failure not only to stop Israel’s almost 50-year campaign of de facto annexation but also to offer a compelling alternative.

U.S. officials have never understood that the challenge they face is not to prevent the one-state option but to undo it.

The die was cast in the first days after Israel’s decisive June 1967 military victory, which led to the occupation and settlement of the Palestinian territories. Ever since, Israeli policymakers — Labor and Likud alike — have operated on the assumption that Israel’s territorial goals had been achieved and confronted the question of how to manage this achievement."

Yet the bank has taken few concrete steps to protect community members from harassment and ensure that people can speak freely without putting themselves or their family members at risk.

In Cambodia security forces have jailed Nget Khun, a 75-year-old community activist on several occasions for protesting evictions stemming from projects financed by the World Bank (PDF). Grandma Mommy, as Khun is known locally, and her fellow community members have been in and out of jail for years. During a May 2012 arrest, she said, four or five security personnel carried her “like they were carrying a pig” and threw her in a car.

After a summary trial in which her defense lawyer was given no time to prepare his case or call defense witnesses, she and 12 other activists were convicted of illegal occupancy of public property and obstructing public officials. An appeals court later suspended their sentences after public pressure, but they spent a month in jail. In November 2014 she and six other women were convicted of obstructing traffic and spent five months in jail before being pardoned in April. The government has also violently cracked down on protesters and threatened community activists.

The bank has strongly opposed the government’s plan to evict people from their homes in Khun’s community, but it has been silent about the attacks on outspoken community members.

Many people affected by bank-financed projects live in countries where the government has limited tolerance for criticism. Over the last two years, Human Rights Watch interviewed critics of projects financed by the World Bank and its private sector lending arm, the International Finance Corp. (IFC), in Cambodia, India, Uganda, Uzbekistan and elsewhere. More than half the activists and individuals, who have lodged formal complaints against 34 bank-financed projects, said they were threatened or faced some form of reprisal because of their criticism. Yet the bank and the IFC have done very little to protect them."

It would put a target on the communities where they’re housed, inspiring jailbreak attempts or attacks on people in those communities. It’s no surprise, then, that a town such as Leavenworth, Kansas, would seem largely opposed to the move.

Consider the case of one man: Omar Abdel Rahman, otherwise known as the Blind Sheik. Rahman’s biography reads like a greatest hits of international terrorism: He was involved with violent jihadist groups in 1980s Egypt (including a group linked to the assassination of President Anwar Sadat). During the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Rahman hooked up with Osama bin Laden and eventually became a member of al Qaeda, relocating to New York to do international fundraising for the group. He had connections with the first World Trade Center bombers and was arrested in 1993 for his connections with plots to attack various sites around New York. He was sentenced to life in prison that same year.

Whether these protests are out of genuine fear or just an effort to stir voters up, they’re without merit.

Over the past couple of weeks, there have been a number of objections to the Obama Administration’s plan to possibly move some number of Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons in an effort to close the notorious island prison. Politicians such as South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, whose state’s U.S. Naval Consolidated Brig is being considered, has harshly criticized the plan. And Governor Sam Brownback of Kansas, home to Fort Leavenworth — another potential home for the detainees — has also objected and held a public forum near the prison to spur opposition.

Hundreds of terrorists have been incarcerated in federal prisons since 9/11, and none of these facilities or the surrounding communities have ever been attacked as a result.

Meanwhile, Rahman is safely housed at a medium-security facility, Federal Correctional Complex Butner, in North Carolina, near the cities of Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill. Al Qaeda hasn’t forgotten about him, though. The group mentions Rahman, along with al Qaeda member Aafia Siddique, also in U.S. prison in Fort Worth, Texas, and calls for his release in its propaganda on a regular basis. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri called for Rahman’s release in his latest video message, released earlier this month. It has been a part of multiple hostage demands by al Qaeda and related groups.

Yet there have been no jailbreak attempts in North Carolina and no attacks on surrounding cities. One of the highest-profile jihadists in the world languishes in a medium-security U.S. prison and none of the nightmare scenarios pushed by Guantánamo closure opponents have happened.

It’s hardly surprising, since prison officials from the American Correctional Association, the Bureau of Prisons, and correctional unions have all along said that Guantánamo detainees wouldn’t be a problem to house in U.S. prisons. These facilities, including some being considered for the detainees, are home to some incredibly infamous and dangerous prisoners – gang leaders, serial killers, murderers and other criminals.

In fact, hundreds of terrorists have been incarcerated in federal prisons since 9/11, and none of these facilities or the surrounding communities have ever been attacked as a result. The Guantánamo detainees have been called “the worst of the worst,” but few of them have ever been convicted of any crime, and most of them are likely, at most, lower-level fighters. These men are nothing special in terms of the threat they pose. The Government Accountability Office even released a report in 2012, evaluating the possibility of moving Guantánamo detainees to U.S. prisons and concluded that with some augmentations to those facilities, it could be done without issue.

The paranoia about moving Guantánamo detainees to U.S. prisons is just a lot of hot air from terrorism hawks and NIMBYism by community groups. U.S. prisons already house people such as terrorist darling Omar Abdel Rahman and hundreds more like him. If politicians and the public took an honest look at the matter, there wouldn’t be so much fear about bringing a handful of detainees stateside."

The bad news is that those sanctions also seem to be helping the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

Sanctions are designed to inflict pain in order to change behavior. There is no question that pain is being inflicted on Russia. It runs the gamut from the unavailability of French cheese to delays in developing the oil resources of the Arctic. However, the Russians who consume French cheese are the urbane types who are usually anti-Putin, though many have become more fiercely patriotic as the pressure mounts from the West. Note that the French cheese manufacturer is also hurt by the sanctions, not to mention the French shipbuilders who will not get any more contracts from Mistral assault carriers after canceling out on the first 1.2 billion-euro contract.

So far, at least, the bottom line is that the pain is being inflicted, but Russian behavior hasn’t changed.

But how are the sanctions helping ISIL? Part of it is simple math and is exemplified by the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan. A bit smaller than Wisconsin, Tajikistan has 8 million people, more than a third of whom live beneath the poverty line. For that reason, more than a million young Tajik men have travelled to Russia in search of jobs. They do the work — repairing streets, construction, shoveling snow, driving cabs — that Russians are reluctant to do. Last year, the remittances they sent home accounted for 36 percent of Tajikstan’s GDP, a frighteningly high percentage. (Tajikstan sends the most young men to Russia but some of the other “stans” send them as well, with “Tajik” becoming something of a shorthand for guest workers there.)

The sanctions that have inflicted pain on the Russian economy mean there is less work for the Tajik guest workers to do. Something like 200,000 have returned home: Forty percent less money is being sent back than in previous years. That alone means a 16 percent drop in GDP. Nearly a quarter of a million young men are returning to Tajikistan to a situation that will only be made worse by their arrival. They will find no opportunities at home and will thus be vulnerable to the appeal of the Taliban and ISIL."

One in Savannah, Georgia. Three in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Two in Sacramento, California. One in Boston. In the past week, 21 people have been killed in mass shootings across the United States, according to statistics collected by the Mass Shootings Tracker website.

After a shooting in Oregon in October that left nine victims dead, President Barack Obama said, “This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America.” But he actually understated the frequency of such attacks. As of this writing, more than 350 mass shootings have taken place in 2015 — more than one a day.

The frustration shown by Obama and others was on display again this week after the attack in San Bernardino, where two heavily armed assailants opened fire on an office holiday party at a social services center. After such incidents, there is a natural impulse to do something, but nothing ever seems to get done. Advocates of new gun control measures note that relatively easy steps to mitigate the potential harm of these assaults, such as mandatory background checks for gun sales, remain untaken.

The contrast with incidents perceived as acts of international terrorism — which, in practice, usually means attacks by Islamic extremists in contact with foreign groups — is striking. These events, too, are met with the same impulse that we must do something, but in these cases, action seems to come easy. Not only does public policy shift quickly, but the something that typically gets done — a military intervention abroad — often carries incredible costs that political elites and the public seem not to fret about much.

Take the attacks last month in Paris by assailants linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The smoke had barely cleared from the attackers’ gun barrels when several new measures were put in place by the United States. Obama tightened security measures in the visa waiver program, which allows foreigners from select countries to enter the U.S. without specific permission, and pledged to increase the presence of special forces troops fighting ISIL in Iraq and Syria.

The latter move was supported by public opinion. A Washington Post/ABC poll after the Paris attacks found that nearly three-quarters of respondents wanted the U.S. to increase its airstrikes in Syria and Iraq and 6 in 10 supported sending more ground troops.

Americans, in other words, are prepared to bear the potentially extraordinary costs of a military intervention, including billions in spending and the increased risks of troops dying in battle, to deal with the threat from ISIL, and policymakers are more than happy to oblige.

As far as addressing mass shootings at home, however, any step toward gun control gets bogged down in political squabbles. In contrast to sending troops into harm’s way, basic restrictions on purchasing powerful weapons get mixed results in national polls. After the shooting in Oregon in October, Gallup found that a majority of Americans supported tougher rules on buying guns. A similar bump occurred after the Sandy Hook school killings in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, but the majority support for reforms dissipated within a year.

Ongoing negotiations with Iran to reach some sort of an agreement on how to structure its nuclear program serve as a reminder that we still live in the shadow of the bomb. We mustn’t forget that there exists a very real man-made method to eradicate life on Earth.

This makes it all the more troubling that President Barack Obama has very quietly betrayed his past promises of nuclear proliferation and been making dangerous upgrades to our nuclear arsenal, specifically the B61-12 nuclear bomb.

One of the reasons Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 2009 was his proclaimed support of nuclear non-proliferation. Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the United Nations nuclear monitoring group the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters that he couldn’t think of a figure more deserving of the award than Obama. “In less than a year in office, [Obama] has transformed the way we look at ourselves and the world we live in and rekindled hope for a world at peace with itself,” he said.

In an attempt to fulfill the bombastic promise of his Nobel, Obama’s 2010 Nuclear Posture Review articulated his intent not to develop new nukes. But non-action isn’t enough in a nuclear context. The inertia his policy has enabled brought about continued investment and continued production, and the B61-12 nuclear bomb is an example of America’s ongoing appetite for new weapons technology. Even though the B61 type nuclear bomb has been around since the '60s as a staple of our last-resort nuclear gravity bomb arsenal, its latest iteration should be classified as a new weapon entirely. Its guidance system, a complex Boeing-designed tail kit, and dial-a-yield controls to vary the power of the blast, also make it more dangerous than previous weapons, if only because it is more likely to actually be used.

Before the latest iteration, the most recent innovation to the B-61 series was a “bunker busting” variant developed in the late 1990s. All of these models were designed to drop from planes and freefell on to their targets. While it’s true that a high yield, hard-to-aim bomb has traditionally been a method of helping to ensure that our nuclear arsenal is used primarily as a deterrent to other nuclear powers, the B61-12, with a highly sophisticated $178 billion tail guidance system isn’t part of a defensive posture at all. A more accurate nuke could theoretically end up saving lives by creating less collateral damage — but not before wreaking havoc on their actual targets. What’s more, this accuracy makes the bombs more likely to actually be used at all, transforming the bomb from a strategic last resort into a feasible tactical method.

As well as being easier to aim, B61-12’s have a feature that allows their dispatcher to control the blast yield, or the amount of energy released in a nuclear blast, usually expressed in equivalent tons of TNT. It sounds counterintuitive, but adjusting the blast radius of a nuclear weapon down makes it more likely to be used in future conflicts because it, at least theoretically, presents a chance of reducing collateral damage.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists categorizes tactical nukes as “weapons in search of a doctrine”, and warns that “there is no rational doctrine” for the use of these kinds of tactical nukes, that a war in which they were used “may create the illusion that a limited nuclear war can be fought” cleanly and efficiently without devolving into a full-blown nuclear holocaust."

Both have been featured on the cover of Time magazine.

On a first look, however, they couldn’t be more different. One is a Jewish American self-proclaimed “democratic socialist” politician from Vermont; the other, a Catholic religious leader from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bernie Sanders and Pope Francis, however, share a moral vision of the limitations and real-life repercussions of our current political-economic system as well as a sincere desire to change it.

This surprising intersection of political-economic ideas rooted in morality also reminds us that many people of the sixties generation not only have a history in common, but have become highly successful and moved into positions of considerable influence. Moreover, the huge response in America, to the Sanders campaign in particular, tells us something important not only about the state of this country, but also about what people with conviction can accomplish, despite their age. The moral courage in the face of systemic challenges demonstrated by both leaders recalls the sixties generation they are both a product of; Sanders as a civil rights activist amidst intense social turmoil and the pope as a young religious leader during a time of military dictatorship and right-wing death squads.

The pope has condemned the arrangements of our current political-economic system. Early on in his papacy, he set the tone:

Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system. Meanwhile, the excluded are still waiting.

Recently he has struck an even more radical tone. “An unfettered pursuit of money rules,” he told grassroots organizers in Bolivia. “That is the dung of the devil.”

Sanders, while not often calling out capitalism by name, similarly challenges the injustices and inequities it generates and explicitly calls himself a socialist. Long before his Sept. 14 speech at Liberty University, Sanders articulated his critique of our unequal economic system in moral terms. “I think this goes back to the Bible,” he told Mother Jones shortly before launching his presidential campaign. “There is something immoral when so few have so much and so many have so little.” At his Liberty University address, Sanders declared:

It would be hard for anyone in this room today to make the case that the United States of America, our great country, a country which all of us love — it would be hard to make the case that we are a just society, or anything resembling a just society today … when we talk about morality, and when we talk about justice, we have to, in my view, understand that there is no justice when so few have so much and so many have so little.

These remarkable indictments of the system resonate because more and more people are coming to terms with the inability of small gestures of reform to address a host of deteriorating or stagnating economic, social and environmental trends: rising inequality, high levels of poverty, continued discrimination against women and people of color, staggering levels of incarceration, increasing corruption of the political system and looming ecological catastrophe, to name a few. The system is broken, and what is needed is systemic change — not simply changes in policy but a radical rethinking of the structure of the economy and society."

Just 62 people have more wealth than the bottom half of human beings, about 3.6 billion people, the international anti-poverty organization estimates. And the top 1 percent now have as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent.

Oxfam released its report just ahead of the annual gathering of billionaires at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a ski resort in the heart of a long-time favored haven of the exploitive superrich, Switzerland. But expecting the billionaires to take the lead in reducing inequality makes as much sense as expecting toddlers think about their long-term best interests. And therein lies the problem with the mere documenting of income and wealth inequality, which I’ve been doing for more than two decades.

In fact, bankers the world over, from Davos to Hong Kong, should lift flutes of Cristal, a favorite of oligarchs and kings, to toast Oxfam for severely understating just how much the richest of the rich have stashed away untaxed.

Tax havens are a big problem, Oxfam claims, quite rightly. But its report put out a figure that is deeply flawed and captures just a third of the total wealth hidden offshore. Oxfam cited research based on a single International Monetary Fund data set, showing $7.6 trillion of wealth hidden in tax havens. But in 2012 James S. Henry, former chief economist at McKinsey, the world’s top consulting firm, showed the figure is at least $21 trillion, a number derived from multiple official reports that include hard assets as well as the money the IMF data shows.

Oxfam’s report also produced some nice charts showing how some top wealth holders such as Warren Buffett are tied to the financial and pharmaceutical sectors. But that’s relatively useless information unless one understands how these sectors rely on the legal creation of the corporate form — itself a kind of government favor — taxpayer subsidies, favorable accounting rules and other official favors.

Oxfam researchers predicted these stark inequality figures in previous studies. They could be confident of such advance observations because wealth must continue to pile up at the very top under current government rules. And it is government, of course, that makes the rules governing economic activity, liability and taxes.

The trend cannot continue forever. The narrowing of growth in income and wealth at the top will, in time, mean that select handful will gather up all the gains and then what interest would everyone else have in working for their benefit? People will put up with not being rewarded for their efforts for a long, long time, but in the end history shows the result is always the same: peaceful reform or bloody revolution.

What’s missing in all the news reports about Oxfam’s study on the increasing concentration of wealth at the top are explanations for why each year the richest of the rich get a larger and larger share of the wealth pie while workers see their slice diminish. Why is wealth concentration proceeding apace?

The answer is simple: government policy."

The state of New York is making moves to approve a $15 per hour floor, joining Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. There is growing support for ensuring minimal income levels to promote equitable living standards. Less attention has been paid, however, to the capricious relationship minimum wage policy has with inflation. The U.S. is unique among developed nations in maintaining an inadequately low federal poverty rate and failing to accommodate increases in the cost of living.

The federal minimum wage rate has historically been intended to provide the minimal salary working Americans need to earn a meaningful living. Though the minimum wage has been increasing consistently since its enactment in 1938, at 25 cents per hour, its value in any given year has to be understood in terms of real dollars. Factoring in the Consumer Price Index, the jump in the minimum wage from $5.15 in 2006 to $7.25 in 2009, for instance, was minimally significant in terms of providing financial relief.

The real purchasing power of a minimum wage fluctuates greatly, peaking and dropping at intervals. Moreover, each increase in the minimum wage is reactive, providing some relief to low-skill workers, but then dropping in subsequent years, until federal action is required yet again. In other words, with each passing year, wages remain stagnant while the purchasing power of the dollar becomes progressively weaker.

If working people cannot sustain themselves with wages alone, they will have to rely on government entitlements and safety net programs to supplement their resources. Such services are typically means-tested, which means that eligibility is reserved only for those who lack sufficient income. Such requirements are often defined by a poverty threshold, which is known as the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). In the U.S., the original measurement for the poverty threshold was computed as the cost of a minimally substantive meal for a family of four, multiplied by three.

Why is this important? For starters, there is a gap between FPL thresholds and the minimum wage floor. For example, earning 100 percent of the federal poverty threshold would mean that a single individual would be earning $11,770, while a full-time worker working 52 weeks of the year would earn $15,080. In essence, the measurement of poverty would suggest that the annual salary at minimum wage is less than $4,000 higher than what the federal government considers to be “in poverty.” For context, the average monthly rent for a home in Minneapolis, hardly an expensive city, is $1,259 per month."

Murrow told a roomful of TV executives, “We are currently wealthy, fat, comfortable and complacent.” The anchorman, who used his position to take on powerful politicians such as former Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy and issues such as segregation, cautioned that the new medium was being used to “distract, delude, amuse and insulate” the public.

Almost 60 years later, Murrow’s warning has gone unheeded by the corporate broadcast media. On June 8, CNN unveiled “Courageous,” a new production unit and an in-house studio that would be paid by advertisers to produce and broadcast news-like “branded content.”

“This isn’t about confusing editorial with advertising,” CNN executive Dan Riess told the Wall Street Journal. But a corporation going beyond advertising on a channel and funding the network to produce PR segments made to look like news is exactly the kind of confusion Riess is referring to.

More than ever before, the American public needs reliable, impartial news outlets that report on the stories of the day honestly and objectively. And while some savvy news consumers may turn to independent, online sources for information that is free from corporate influence, the majority of Americans who work 8 to 10-hour days don’t have the time or energy to seek out these sources. A 2013 Gallup poll found that 50 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 listed television as their primary source of news. A similar survey last year from the American Press Institute, a nonprofit that conducts research on the future of journalism, reported that 95 percent of adults over the age of 60 consume TV news. When these viewers turn on their television, they should not be served with a rosy, one-sided portrayal of a multinational corporation that may have been accused of worker or environmental abuses that often go unreported. (As of this writing, inquiries to CNN regarding which corporations have paid for segments on “Courageous” have not been returned.)

During Murrow’s era, broadcasters were granted licenses with the understanding that they would operate in the public interest. For example, a 1960 report by the Federal Communications Commission, which governs the broadcast media, identified 14 program areas that licensed broadcasters should follow in order to ensure diversity programming and serve the public interest. Of the 14 targets, educational programs, public affairs, editorials from licensees, political broadcasts and news programs were highlighted as key to advancing the public interest. But in the decades since, as the news became more commoditized, broadcasters have largely discarded public service in favor of higher profits and stock prices to suit investors. The elimination of the Fairness Doctrine — a policy the Federal Communications Commission adopted in 1949 that instructed news outlets to operate in the interest of impartially informing the public — signified the end of any governmental mandate for broadcasters to work in the public interest."

After seeing annual growth of 3 percent in the years after independence in 1947, the rate began to double, reaching a rate of around 6 percent per year after 1980. However, the distribution of growth proceeds has been very uneven across different constituents of the Indian population. Can we reasonably hope that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been celebrated as a harbinger of economic change by national and international media, will bring about an equalizing change in the Indian growth process? Or will he allow inequalities to rise in the coming years? It is becoming clear that the political forces that brought Modi to power in 2014 tend to favor growing inequality in India and oppose government programs that would alleviate it. Urban elites — owners, managers and professionals in the formal sector —have garnered most of the relative gains from India’s growth. And the state is helping them: There is a revolving door between the business world and the political sphere, which ends up meaning that policies put big business over ordinary Indians.

Growing inequality

Rising inequality has become an important issue in India. The National Sample Survey Organization reports that while a majority of Indians live on less than a dollar a day (at nominal exchange rates), the country boasts a significant number of billionaires on Forbes’ 2015 list. The NSSO collects data on household consumption (not incomes) through the use of large-scale household surveys conducted every five years. The figures show us that India hasn’t always been a massively unequal country, even during periods of high growth. In the 1980s, inequality among individuals measured in terms of consumption expenditure remained more or less the same. Meanwhile, the gap between expenditure in urban and rural areas widened, but rural areas themselves experienced a sharp decline in inequality due to proactive government interventions in the form of welfare programs and agricultural worker mobilizations for higher wages. During this period, overall inequality across the country remained roughly unchanged. In the 1990s, the story changed dramatically: Inequality rose substantially, with the Gini coefficient — a ratio that measures the gap between the richest and poorest citizens — jumping from 32.6 percent in 1993-94 to 37 percent in 2009-10. Inequality went up primarily within urban areas; the urban-rural gap widened too. But rural inequality again remained stable, in part thanks to welfare-oriented reforms such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) that since 2004 has guaranteed 100 days of employment at a minimum wage to rural residents and improved institutional credit to farmers. Such measures were introduced in response to heightened rural distress, a spate of farmer suicides and resultant protests and demonstrations organized by farming communities across the country.

Modi’s Make in India strategy, which aims to make the country an important manufacturing hub of the world, may not succeed and will not reduce inequality.

As in China after 1992, it was a series of market-oriented, Big Business–friendly economic reforms introduced in India in 1991 that contributed significantly to rising inequality. First, Indian agriculture became increasingly connected to the global markets and went through a deep recession from the mid-1990s until 2006. To this day, a majority of the Indian population lives in rural areas, with incomes directly or indirectly associated with agriculture. Second, the high-growth sectors that emerged during the reform era have not created enough jobs to lift all India’s boats. For instance, India’s well-known information technology sector (which includes outsourcing) recruits less than 2 percent of the entire workforce — and even for the slender minority that has benefited from it, wages have not kept pace with rising productivity. As Thomas Piketty outlined in his bestselling “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” this implies that profits are growing much faster than wages, bringing about more inequality. Third, internal migration from rural to urban areas increased between 2001 and 2011. There are also many “footloose” migrants, who spend part of the year in rural areas and the other part in urban areas. Once they move to cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, most migrants find employment in the urban informal sector in low-wage jobs with little security and precarious living conditions. The low-cost informal sector enables private enterprise and wealthy individuals to increase their profits, contributing to inequality further. Finally, trends in land and real estate ownership are concentrating assets in the hands of an ever smaller group of people. Farmers lose their land through the creation of special economic zones and expansion of urban spaces. This transfer of ownership — and future profits — to wealthier buyers, frequently through coercion and for cheap prices, only heightens inequality. Add to that heightened speculation in the financial and real estate markets, and inequality grows even starker.

New York is now taking action against nail salons that exploit their employees.

This issue mirrors a broader pattern nationwide. More than 11 million undocumented immigrants toil in America’s fields, construction sites, salons and fast-food establishments — workers in a shadow economy with little ability to push back when employers disregard civil and human rights, including basic safeguards such as safe conditions and fair pay. Protection for these vulnerable workers is much needed at the state and national levels.

The most cited problem facing unauthorized immigrants is wage theft, an illegal practice in which employers withhold workers’ pay. Every year, 6.5 million undocumented workers experience wage theft. Low-wage workers across the nation lose roughly $50 billion annually.

Those who protest this abuse face employer retaliation, often culminating in deportation. Unlike most American workers, who are legally protected when they blow the whistle on employer wrongdoing, undocumented workers don’t have this right. Because of their legal status, employers can fire undocumented workers and hold hostage any owed wages. They can self-audit their employment records, invite immigration authorities to conduct an audit or simply tip off the authorities to avoid paying up.

Antonio Vanegas, for example, who worked at a Quick Pita at Reagan National Airport in Virginia, complained that he was being paid below minimum wage. His reward? He was detained and faced ongoing threats of deportation.

Low-income immigrants spend most of their earnings on basic necessities. Wage theft pushes these workers even further into the informal economy, causing job anxiety, robbing their households of much-needed income and sapping their neighborhoods of economic vitality."

This is not the beginning of a joke, but a reality the restaurant industry is facing that will affect millions in its workforce.

Technology threatens to replace low- and medium-skilled jobs, predominantly held by people of color, in the $709.2 billion restaurant industry. In May, Wendy’s opened a facility near the campus of Ohio State University that will design and test consumer-facing technologies, including a new online ordering app. In 2011, European branches of McDonalds added 7,000 touch-screen cashiers. McDonald’s claims that the few locations in the U.S. with automated cashiers will not affect workforce numbers, but that’s difficult to believe: Computerization and reliance on robotic technology are already changing the industry.

For instance, Amazon recently reported that it intends for robots to eventually replace its warehouse workers. A February report on the future of innovation and employment from Citi GPS and the University of Oxford, meanwhile, states that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk. And in September 2013, Oxford researchers warned that 70 percent of low-skilled and nearly half of medium-skilled U.S. jobs are at risk of being replaced by robots or other technology in the next 10 to 20 years.

And while the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports (PDF) that the restaurant industry is among the top 10 areas projected for job growth between 2012 and 2022, there are real questions about what that workforce will look like over that period of time.

According to the Restaurant Opportunities Center, more than 11 million people are employed by the industry as managers, servers, cooks, bartenders, hosts, bussers and runners. As of 2015, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that more than 40 percent of food and drink services workers are people of color, and more than half of them are women. Research finds that people of color and women tend to occupy the industry’s lowest-paying jobs and often work behind the scenes as cashiers, bussers and dishwashers. With the automation of many of these jobs, their livelihoods are at risk.

Organizing and political action for reform and policy change offer some recourse to address pressing issues, such as institutional racism and low wages. But unless we address the role of new technology, our most vulnerable workers will yet again be left behind.

In the last two decades, the U.S. has invested significantly in closing technology gaps. Yet advocates of high-speed Internet, for example, continue to draw attention to insufficient access and affordability for communities of color."

The decision came a year after the state implemented a new ID requirement to vote, purportedly to protect against voter fraud.

At least half a million Alabamans, or 20 percent of the state’s registered voters, lack a driver’s license or alternative DMV-issued ID. As with the restrictive ID law, civil rights advocates say the closure of 31 DMV offices — disproportionately affecting poor, rural communities where black people make up a large share of the population — narrows access to IDs and, as a result, will disfranchise black voters. State officials insist that their decision was not race based. Irrespective of intent, the move will suppress black votes.

The closures target communities that lack easy access to public transportation. Nearly 14 percent of black families do not own a vehicle, while only 4 percent of families are without private transportation. Of the 10 counties with the highest percentages of black residents, only two will have DMV offices. Unsurprisingly, the DMV closures affect 53 percent of the 15 counties that voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 and the five counties that voted most heavily Democratic in that election. Meanwhile, 40 offices will remain open in the 55 counties that are predominantly white.

“I am particularly appalled by this decision, in light of the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches and the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965,” Rep. Terri Sewell, the state’s only Democratic and African-American congressional delegate, said in an Oct. 5 statement asking the Department of Justice to investigate. “It’s utterly disappointing that my home state — the very state that launched the movement towards equality — is the same state that has become fertile ground for its demise.”

State officials maintain residents can obtain a required ID for voting, including free cards, at the board of registrars in each of its 67 counties, the Statehouse and a mobile unit. But some residents live far from county seats. Despite claims of easy access, only 5,294 IDs were issued last year and a paltry 1,442 so far this year.

“You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink,” Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said earlier this month, laying the blame at voters’ feet for not obtaining required IDs. The effect is already clear. In the wake of the ID requirement last year, Alabama’s 41 percent voter turnout during the midterm elections was its lowest in nearly three decades.

States have proved they cannot be entrusted to protect the right of all citizens to vote. President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the landmark Voting Rights Act (VRA) in March 1965, six months after the haunting images of police brutality against nonviolent protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on Bloody Sunday. But in 2013 a divided Supreme Court in Shelby v. Holder gutted the provision requiring states with a long history of discrimination to get preclearance from the federal government to amend their electoral laws. Tellingly, Alabama announced plans to implement its 2011 ID law just hours after the court ruled on the VRA. That and the subsequent DMV closures illustrate exactly why the VRA must be restored."

California Teachers Association (CTA) on Monday, two distinct groups formed outside the courthouse. The pro-union crowd was large and multiracial and held up bright handmade signs; there were many black people, Latinos and older folks with canes, all of whom stated that allowing public sector unions to opt out of union dues payments constituted an attack on unions in general.

The rally for Rebecca Friedrichs and her supporters was much smaller, whiter and more polished and featured one of the right’s heaviest hitters, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist. His presence wasn’t exactly a surprise: Their side was gunning for the court to rule that public sector workers should be able to opt out of paying fair-share dues to the unions representing them.

Friedrichs and her crew believe that requiring employees to pay these fees is a violation of their free speech. If the plaintiffs have their way — which is very likely, given the five-to-four conservative tilt of the court — the court could impose a right-to-work regime on all public sector unions. That means that workers could opt out and not have to pay agency shop fees to a union that would nonetheless continue to represent them.

Trade unionists understandably see this as a freeloader problem and predict a big financial hit that would make it harder for unions to fight government employers during contract negotiations and defend members during disciplinary actions. Such a ruling would embolden government officials to lower wages, reduce benefits and privatize services. (Unions are currently the largest organized force combating that trend.) In addition to hurting a key ally of the Democratic Party, it would muffle some of the strongest voices advocating for smaller class sizes in public schools and for more emergency response services for all Americans, because organized labor would be much busier organizing workers to become members and pay dues.

There are a few reasons for unionists to cross their fingers and look to glimmers of hope. Sophia Lee, a legal historian at the University of Pennsylvania, said that in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, the precedent-setting case in 1977 that mandated agency-shop fees, Richard Nixon appointee Justice William Rehnquist sided with the majority because the proper conservative judicial position was for the court to restrain from governing affairs of employers and employees. Justice Antonin Scalia, Lee contends, is more in line with that doctrine than his right-wing bench-fellows. She also says the right has so far failed to bring fresh arguments to the debate. “I found them shockingly uncreative,” she remarked on the briefs filed on the plaintiff’s behalf, noting that the onus is on the plaintiff to bring new information to light."

A four-year span is also, it seems, how long a repressive security force can expect to wait before the U.S. government loses its nerve and lifts its objections to resupplying it with arms.

The U.S. State Department’s ban on weapons sales to the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF) was introduced in late 2011 in response to the force’s part in the deaths and torture of protesters earlier that year. As major protests spread across the region during the Arab Spring, many thousands of Bahraini people joined widespread demonstrations against corruption and for democratic reform. Bahrain is governed by an unelected ruling family; the king’s uncle has been the prime minister for more than 40 years. The Bahraini dictatorship, with full support and participation of the BDF, responded to the protesters with violence and brutality — arresting, imprisoning, injuring, and even killing several protesters.

In response to the State Department’s arms censure Bahrain’s military sat quietly, waiting four years without holding any senior official accountable for its abuses.

Pediatric orthopedic surgeon Dr. Ali Alekri was one of dozens of medics whom Bahraini authorities arrested, tortured and jailed in 2011 for their perceived support of the demonstrations. BDF soldiers seized him at the hospital where he worked and took him to a military facility, where he was beaten and forced to eat feces.

From his prison in Bahrain, Alekri yesterday reflected on the horror he has endured and the lack of progress that has been made since. “Four years ago I treated injured protesters and told the media the truth about what was happening in Bahrain,” he said. “I don’t regret doing my duty as a medic, but I’m disappointed Washington hasn’t done its duty in standing up for us.”

Meanwhile sectarian tension and political instability has deepened, fueled by the BDF’s failure to recruit personnel from the country’s majority Shia community. Having a military force made up virtually exclusively from the Sunni minority does little to reduce the country’s sectarianism. Many young protesters and human rights defenders continue to regard their army as an enemy.

There have been many opportunities for Washington to use its military influence with Bahrain as an inducement to reform. The United States engages in training programs for Bahraini security forces and could have refused to train Sunni-only batches of officers, for example. Diversifying the security force was something the Bahraini government promised to do “urgently” as one of 26 recommendations made by an independent commission of inquiry."

Twenty years later, it’s clear that the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians never recovered from Rabin’s killing. After Shimon Peres’ subsequent loss to Benjamin Netanyahu in the 1996 elections, the political camp that Rabin was leading collapsed, leaving Israeli politics as a competition among the right, the radical right and the crazy right.

In the years that followed, Israeli settlements expanded in the West Bank, likely beyond the point of no return. Today every fifth person beyond the Green Line is a Jew. Rather than present an alternative to the right, Rabin’s Labor Party supported Netanyahu’s military campaigns against the Palestinians, and the hawkish Likud party became the dominant political force in Israel. Likud’s ideology — the desire to maintain Israeli control over the West Bank, by force, if necessary — now reflects the Israeli consensus. Even Netanyahu’s rivals in recent years (Ehud Olmert, Tzipi Livni, Avigdor Lieberman, Naftali Bennet) are either former Likud members or former Netanyahu staffers. The entire political system has shifted rightward.

Could things have turned out differently? Rabin formed his government at a unique moment: right after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, with new diplomatic momentum in the Middle East after the Persian Gulf War. Moreover, the first intifada (1988 to 1992) taught a generation of Israelis the price of maintaining military control over millions of Palestinians. The previously radical ideas of talking to the Palestine Liberation Organization and supporting Palestinian statehood became widespread in certain circles.

Internal dynamics were just as important. In 1992, Rabin and the parties that formed his political bloc won a minimal majority — 61 of the Knesset’s 120 seats — and only thanks to a right-wing party’s just barely failing to win a seat. This almost accidental result forced Rabin to break another Israeli taboo and rely on the support of the non-Zionist Arab parties for his government.

A byproduct of this dynamic was a rise in government investments in Israel’s Arab population. While this didn’t bridge the gap created by four decades of discrimination and exploitation, it was still the most significant change in Israel’s history on that matter. It appeared that all the stars were in place for implementing the liberal Zionist ideology: separating from the Palestinian population that came under Israeli control in 1967 and bringing more equality within the pre-1967 borders, all without changing the constitutional arrangements that make Israel a Jewish state.

The murder occurred at a crucial moment: right after the Knesset approved the second Oslo Accord — again, with the narrowest possible majority — and when the discussion on a final status agreement seemed to have reached a breakthrough. At the end of October 1995, then–Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin reached an understanding with Mahmoud Abbas, then the deputy for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, on the framework for a final status settlement. A few days after the negotiations concluded, Rabin was killed. Acting Prime Minister Peres, always fearful of being seen as too left wing, rejected the document. Israelis would always be left wondering what would have happened had Rabin lived to approve the framework."
2016-02-24 00:00:00,http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/24/trump-tops-nevada-gop-presidential-caucuses.html,Trump Tops Nevada GOP Presidential Caucuses,[],"[u'republican', u'trump', u'super', u'tops', u'primary', u'winning', u'rubio', u'cruz', u'south', u'nevada', u'caucuses', u'gop', u'presidential', u'carolina']","Donald Trump has won the Republican presidential caucuses in Nevada, giving the billionaire businessman three straight wins in the race for the GOP nomination.

“We will be celebrating for a long time tonight,” he said, add that a prediction that he'll soon claim the GOP nomination.

“It's going to be an amazing two months,” he said. “We might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest.”

“If you listen to the pundits, we weren’t expected to win too much, and now we’re winning, winning, winning the country,” Trump said at a victory rally in Las Vegas. “Soon, the country is going to start winning, winning, winning.”

Trump vowed to keep the open the military dentention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, telling supporters: “We're going to load it up with a lot of bad dudes out there.”

Marco Rubio elbowed out Ted Cruz for second place, far ahead of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who was endorsed by the New York Times for the GOP nomination, and Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon.

Trump is expected to take the bulk of Nevada’s 30 delegates, which would give him more than 80 before February ends, and dwarf the tallies of Cruz and Rubio.

While more than 1,200 are needed to secure the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has a formidable head start.

“If you are Cruz and Rubio you have to worry about how far Trump is getting ahead of you,” said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist in Washington. “These guys have to figure out how to turn their fire on Trump.”

Preliminary entrance polls taken of Republican caucus-goers show that nearly 6 in 10 are angry at the way the government is working, and about half of them supported the billionaire businessman.

Trump was also supported by about 6 in 10 of those who said they care most about immigration, and nearly half of those who said they care most about the economy.

The race for the Republican nomination now moves on to next week's Super Tuesday, when a dozen states will hold presidential primaries.

In the Democratic race, front-runner Hillary Clinton was looking for a commanding victory over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in Saturday's South Carolina primary to give her a boost heading into Super Tuesday. Polls show the former secretary of state with a huge advantage among African-Americans which bodes well for her prospects in South Carolina and then the Southern states which vote on Super Tuesday where blacks make up a large segment of the Democratic primary electorate.

Trump’s victories — in the West, the South and Northeast — a testament to his broad appeal among the mad-as-hell voters making their voices heard in the 2016 presidential race.

Nevada was a critical test for Rubio and Cruz, the two senators battling to emerge as the clear alternative to the GOP front-runner. Rubio was out to prove he can build on recent momentum, while Cruz was looking for a spark to recover from a particularly rocky stretch in his campaign.

Rubio, already campaigning in Michigan as caucus results rolled in, was projecting confidence that he can consolidate the non-Trump voters who have been splintering among an assortment of GOP candidates, saying, “we have incredible room to grow.”

Cruz, a conservative popular among voters on the GOP's right, finished a disappointing third in South Carolina after spending much of the past two weeks denying charges of dishonest campaign tactics and defending his integrity. Another disappointing finish in Nevada would raise new questions about his viability heading into a crucial batch of Super Tuesday states on March 1.

“There's something wrong with this guy,” Trump said with his usual measure of tact during a massive Las Vegas rally Monday night. The former reality television star tweeted on Tuesday: “He used him as a scape goat — fired like a dog! Ted panicked.”

Nevada's caucusing played out in schools, community centers and places of worship across the state — a process that's been chaotic in the past.

Nevada was the first Republican election in the West, the fourth of the campaign. And it's not one that's gotten much attention from the GOP candidates.

Through Tuesday, the Republican candidates and the super PACs supporting them had spent a combined $3.8 million on television and radio advertisements in Nevada — less than a tenth of the $39.3 million spent ahead of last weekend's South Carolina primary, according to Kantar Media's CMAG data.

That primary reduced a GOP field that included a dozen candidates a month ago to five, with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush the latest to drop out after a disappointing finish in South Carolina. Kasich and Carson could play spoilers as the trio of leading candidates, Trump, Cruz and Rubio, battle for delegates with an increasing sense of urgency.

Trump's rivals concede they are running out of time to stop him.

The election calendar suggests that if the New York billionaire's rivals don't slow him by mid-March, they may not ever. Trump swept all of South Carolina's 50 delegates, giving him a total of 67 compared to Cruz (11) and Rubio (10).

After finishing third in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire and second in South Carolina, Rubio needs a win soon to support the idea that he is the prime heir to Bush's supporters.

Indeed, Republican establishment heavyweights have been flooding to Rubio in recent days, including Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch. South Florida's three Cuban-American members of Congress announced their support for him in the hours before the Nevada contest.

The genre feeds off stereotypes, linking the twinned emotions of fascination and disgust. It thrives by portraying its subjects as Other, rendering them as objects to loathe, mock, desire or praise. If there’s something you really care about, the last thing you should want is to see it portrayed on reality TV.



So it was with intense trepidation that I watched the first two episodes of “Born This Way,” a six-episode show from the A&E network about seven Californian millennials with Down syndrome. I am the father of a boy with Down syndrome and a critic of the ways we portray disability in the media. There’s so much wrong with how we represent Down syndrome in particular, but reality TV seemed like the worst possible vehicle to correct those wrongs.

To my great surprise, the show is … basically fine. The seven adults with Down syndrome are interesting people living complex lives; their parents generally address the issues related to being a caregiver of a disabled adult clearly, and the show presents many honest and important moments. At its best, “Born This Way” shows its characters addressing work, housing, romance, friendship and other aspects of adult life that, perhaps, most viewers don’t associate with developmental disability. At its worst, the show relies too heavily on manufactured drama and does little to promote inclusion of people with disabilities in the typical mainstream society.

The Down syndrome community has always been caught between the freak and the angel. It’s also caught between trying to promote acceptance of neurological diversity while arguing that people with Down syndrome are “just like you.” We could use a good dose of reality to help the public work through these contradictions, so long as they tune in and really get to know Elena, Megan, Steven, Sean, Rachel, Christina and John. The seven chosen characters are, of course, not representative of the whole spectrum of Down syndrome — reality show producers are in it for the money, for all the A&E head of programming talks about celebrating diversity. They picked seven individuals who will look good on camera in the eyes of mainstream America, and I’m mostly OK with this. We, as a society, tend to regard people with Down syndrome as cute, perpetual children. Seeing adults speak for themselves about adult topics can only help work against this misperception.

The show falls into predictable reality-show tropes. The seven are each edited into an identifiable role — the ladies’ man, the friend, the rapper, the conciliator, the new girl, the leader and the inevitable drama queen. The producers look for tension, editing scenes to maximize effect. Sometimes, the editing works. In episode two, Sean (ladies’ man) has a difficult conversation with his parents about moving house. They are retiring, they want to downsize and he doesn’t want to hear it. There’s powerful emotion to the scene and no easy answers materialize. Similarly, when Megan (the new girl) announces to the gang that she wants to make a documentary about Down syndrome, Elena (drama queen) gets upset, saying that that the whole “D.S. thing” upsets her because “I don’t know why God gave me that in the first place.” Elena’s mother then reveals it took her 20 years to accept her daughter’s diagnosis, something Elena clearly internalized."

But cooking, cleaning and caring are indeed work and should be treated as such.

Household labor is an essential part of day-to-day life that women have performed without pay for centuries. And it’s true that many of us make sandwiches, sweep floors and change diapers because we genuinely care about our homes and families. But this association of household labor with women’s unpaid labor and the labor of care, with its location in the domestic sphere, makes it hard to recognize it as work at all.

The unrecognized and undervalued character of household labor is built into our legal system. In the 1930s, many workers gained the right to a minimum wage, Social Security, unemployment compensation and the right to organize and bargain collectively — but not household workers, who were overwhelmingly African-American women. In the 1960s and 1970s African-American household workers organized a nationwide movement to eliminate the vestiges of slavery associated with the occupation and push for federal minimum wage guarantees, which they won in 1974. Despite these victories, even today, household workers, who are largely immigrant workers, are not covered by civil rights laws and do not have federal protection to form a union. Moreover, even when they have rights, those rights are usually not enforced.

Household workers are often expected to work overtime without pay, come in on holidays and weekends and run the risk of being treated more like indentured servants than paid employees. Most live on the margins of poverty, struggling to support their own families even as they spend their days caring for someone else’s. English may not be their first language; they might not know their rights. Their outsider status renders them and their work devalued and even less visible.

Many employers believe they are doing these workers a favor simply by hiring them and that without these jobs, many working women would have no alternatives. They forget that it goes both ways: Without the labor of domestic workers, many of those employers would not be able to go to work, juggle multiple responsibilities or have some time to themselves. As one domestic workers’ rights organization put it, theirs is “the work that makes all other work possible.”"

Last week saw the Federal Reserve meeting to debate interest rate hikes at the same time that President Barack Obama and the Republican congressional leadership were desperately struggling to find ways to pass fast-track authority in order to facilitate passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. While it may not be immediately apparent, the views of elite commentators on these two events tell us a great deal about their views on economic policy.

The defeat of the original fast-track proposal, due to a revolt by House Democrats, infuriated the likes of George Will, David Brooks and members of The Washington Post editorial board, who all expressed deep dismay that Congress may block the TPP. They have raised various issues, but one recurring theme is that the TPP will promote economic growth and that the opponents are apparently willing to sacrifice this growth if they block the deal.

The claim the TPP will promote growth is dubious. After all, a study by the United States Department of Agriculture found the impact on growth would be a rounding error in GDP. Furthermore, none of the studies that have made growth projections incorporate any negative impact on growth due to higher drug costs or other price increases associated with the TPP’s stronger and longer patent protections.

These models also don’t make projections on the distribution of the benefits of growth from the TPP. After all, if the TPP leads to a higher GDP but all of it goes to Silicon Valley and Wall Street, it is understandable that most people are not very excited about it.

But even ignoring these issues, it is difficult to take these concerns about lost TPP growth very seriously. The highest growth projection from any of the standard models is that it would eventually lead to a 0.4 percent increase in GDP. This impact will not be felt until after the TPP is fully implemented, roughly a dozen years in the future.

To put this in perspective, this is roughly the amount that the economy typically grows in two months. In other words, if we accept the high-end projection and we put the TPP in place back in 1993, then the economy would be as rich at the end of June as it would be in the TPP-less world at the end of August. That would be nice but hardly transformational in terms of economic impact.

By contrast, the Fed is likely planning to raise interest rates in order to slow the economy. The Fed’s board decided not to hike interest rates in June, but it is widely accepted that the Fed will begin to raise interest rates sometime this year, possibly as early as September."

The initial capital for the AIIB, which will be based in Beijing, is expected to be $50 billion, of which half will be provided by China. And the AIIB is one key element of the rapidly growing economic architecture in the region. The recently concluded negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) — a massive U.S.-led international trade agreement that links 12 of the major economies in the Asia-Pacific — would, if ratified, combine nearly 40 percent of the world’s GDP and bolster Washington’s role in guiding the economic trajectory of the Asia-Pacific.

For now, the TPP is an exclusive club. It does not include China, India or many other developing countries in Asia. It is a trade agreement, not an organization like the Chinese-led bank. By contrast, AAIB membership is open to countries all around the world, and key Western countries — including the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain — have overcome their initial skepticism about the transparency and management of the bank and joined.

The bank has also attracted countries from most of the Asia-Pacific region, including such key U.S. allies as Australia and South Korea. Even the Philippines, which is embroiled in a contentious territorial dispute with Beijing in the South China Sea, indicated its desire to join the AIIB. In fact, nearly every country in the Asia-Pacific has joined the bank, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, Bhutan (which has no diplomatic relations with China) and North Korea.

There are two other key outliers: the United States and Japan, the world’s largest and third-largest economies, respectively, and the two main power brokers in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. While they are not opposed to the AIIB in principle, these states say they are unwilling to join until its governance structure and recipient debt sustainability are more clearly defined. But aside from these technical reservations, there is concern in Washington and Tokyo that the AIIB will elevate Chinese influence in the region and erode their long-standing positions. Should Japan sit this one out, it will be the only country in East Asia aside from North Korea to remain outside the AIIB.

The U.S. expressed its disapproval with the AIIB, in its current standing, to its keys allies in Europe and Asia, noting that the bank still lacks the proper governance structure. Up until this point, only Japan — along with Canada and Mexico — have agreed with the U.S. assessment and refrained from signing on. Tokyo’s other main reason for not joining the AIIB is Japan’s leadership role in the more established Asian Development Bank (ADB), a bank based in Manila that focuses on sustainable investment in Asia.

Trump might as well as used the R-word to describe an America that he sees as falling apart or picked some other stigmatizing insult. While “crip” and “cripple” are being reclaimed by activists, that’s no excuse for Trump to use it.

It would be nice to think that at least one candidate in the Fox Business Network debate tonight might call Trump out on his language, but I don’t expect anyone on the stage to champion the rights of disabled Americans. Although there are at least 56 million Americans who have disabilities, living in every part of the country and holding every conceivable political position, no presidential candidate so far this cycle has done anything but make the most cursory of overtures to this untapped, ignored constituency.

Every special interest group wants more attention from politicians, but the disabled are not a clearly defined segment of the American population. Rather, disability is a natural part of the human experience that ultimately confronts everyone. No one is more than one degree of separation away from disability. Only those unlucky enough to die suddenly might avoid disability. This universality makes addressing the needs of disabled Americans more than just a special interest issue.

At the same time, although people who identify as disabled are evenly spread across the American political spectrum, there are certain issues — employment and education opportunities, access to health care, discrimination — that unite them. Our best data demonstrate that despite accessibility obstacles, disabled individuals are highly motivated to vote and will vote for candidates who understand these issues. From the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, disability legislation has an unparalleled history of bipartisan support.

So here we have a huge group of Americans and a set of issues that politicians from either political party might address. And yet disability and the needs of disabled American voters have played almost no role in the election. What’s going on?

A poll sponsored in 2013 by United Cerebral Palsy found that 30 percent of disabled likely voters surveyed identified as Democrats, 23 percent as Republicans and 30 percent as independents. They know their issues and will vote for candidates who respect them. Voting-age Americans with disabilities are a population of 34 million up for grabs.

Academic research confirms this poll’s findings. In 2000, John Gastil, now at Pennsylvania State University, looked at disabled voters in New Mexico. He found that while there were distinct liberal and conservative camps, disability informs voting decisions across the board. Some come to resent government bureaucracy, while others strongly endorse a better safety net. And in 2013, Lisa Schur and Meera Adya published an article on political participation by people with disabilities, “Sidelined or Mainstreamed?” They determined that people with disabilities often do not perceive government officials as responsive and feel that they lack clout in the political system."

Only 42 percent of Americans voted in the 2014 midterm elections, the lowest level of voter turnout since 1978. And midterm voters tend to be older, whiter and richer than the general population. The aggregate number is important but turnout among different groups is even more crucial. Politicians are more accountable and responsive to wealthy voters, not just because rich people vote in elections, but because they are also more likely to donate to campaigns or work on them to get their candidates elected. And the effects of the gap in voter turnout are far-reaching because, for many Americans, elections are one of the only ways in which they can participate in democracy.

Boosting voter participation

Gaps in voter turnout exacerbate the United States’ already unequal political system. Its uniquely difficult electoral system is responsible for much of the low voter participation. This includes the practice of filling key offices during midterm or off-cycle elections, the odd Electoral College, a majoritarian rather than proportional system and the voter registration barrier, which leaves the responsibility for voter registration to citizens. (In most countries, the government conducts voter education and registration.) It doesn’t help that one of the two main political parties views reducing voter turnout as a key to its electoral success. Furthermore, the fact that the United States disenfranchises its many felons contributes to the low turnout. To illustrate why the turnout gap matters, a recent study by political scientist Robert Erikson found that the median voter in 2008 in terms of income was at the 66th percentile for the general population. And as political scientist Michael Barber estimates , fewer than 3 percent of campaign donors, who give more than $200, make less than $50,000 — almost the same as the median household income in the United States. Assuming that politicians respond to the median voter, they are less likely to favor policies of redistribution than they would if they responded to the median citizen.

Families with higher incomes had higher voter turnout in 2014 Source: Census Bureau, 2015

There is also another, less recognized factor at play. In her 2005 book, “How Policies Make Citizens,” political scientist Andrea Louise Campbell argued that government structures and policies could either facilitate or deter citizen participation in politics. For example, Campbell notes that the establishment of Social Security led to increased civic participation by the elderly (especially the poor), by motivating them to defend and seek the program’s expansion. By contrast, the stigma associated with welfare programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) led to a decrease in voter turnout. Other studies corroborate Campbell’s findings. A 2010 study on the role of public policies in civic and political engagement found that initiatives such as Head Start, a federal program that provides early childhood education, health, nutrition and other services to low-income children and their families, increase political participation, while welfare and public housing assistance policies reduce it. Similarly, Suzanne Mettler, author of “Soldiers to Citizens,” argues that the GI Bill, which provided many benefits to World War II veterans, boosted their civic participation. Veterans had a positive experience with the program and felt that they were treated with dignity and respect, which lead to greater political participation, not only through voting but also by boosting veterans’ involvement in civic organizations.

Ahead of the 2016 elections, Democrats need to embrace popular progressive policies to convince potential voters that they are indeed different and that they offer real solutions.

As I’ve noted before, voters' affinity to and identification with political parties and their perception of the differences between the two parties also affect turnout. It’s deleterious to voter participation to pretend that there are not substantive differences between Republicans and Democrats. Last year, the Progressive Change Institute, which promotes progressive policy response to political issues, asked 1,500 of the so-called “drop-off” voters, who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 but did not vote in the 2014 midterm election, what policies would motivate them to vote in 2016. As the chart below illustrates, potential voters listed progressive policies such as debt-free college, universal pre-K and a living wage job guarantee.

Why don’t Americans vote?

In a 2012 USA Today poll , 59 percent of non-voters said they were frustrated by the fact that “nothing ever gets done” in government while 54 percent cited “corruption” and 42 percent pointed to the lack of difference between the two parties. About 37 percent said politics doesn’t make much difference in their lives.

These results suggest that the most effective Republican disenfranchisement strategy may not be voter ID laws, but grinding government to a halt. By forcing government shutdowns, Republican leaders and lawmakers have significantly reduced voter participation to historic lows (see chart below). Less than 1 in 5 Americans believe that government works for the benefit of everyone. Furthermore, recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United v. FEC, which led to the influx of corporate cash into politics and the rise of the donor class, have together turned more people away from politics.

It turns out that the largest car company in world deliberately designed software to allow its cars to deceive emissions testing in the United States.

It’s hard to envision the process that led to this outcome. Did some bright and ambitious young executive suggest to his superiors that rather than finding a way to comply with emission standards it would be cheaper to design a software program to cheat on the test? Then did executives discuss what that would involve and give a green light? And did this scheme end with the executive reporting back the success of cheating software to the CEO and the German version of Mr. Burns from “The Simpsons” rubbing his fingers together and saying, “Excellent”?

We may never know the details of how the top brass at Volkswagen thought it would be a good idea to cheat on emissions tests, but they obviously decided that the savings from going this route was worth the risk of detection and the potential punishment. And if the only punishment is a stretch of unemployment for people who have spent years in high-paying jobs, they are probably right.

The fate of the Volkswagen executives responsible for this fraud is likely to rest largely in the hands of the German legal system, but it is unlikely that they would face serious consequences if they were in the U.S. legal system. Corporate crime is rarely taken seriously, even when it results in avoidable deaths, whether they are caused by excess emissions because of Volkswagen’s decision to circumvent the law or by GM’s cover-up of faulty ignition switches or by Toyota’s cover-up of faulty floor mats that made cars accelerate.

Any discussion of corporate crime in the United States inevitably turns to the behavior of the financial industry during the housing-bubble years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. The major firms in the industry issued fraudulent mortgages on massive basis and then sold them off to investment banks. These banks in turn threw the mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) despite knowing that they were not properly issued.

Then the bond rating agencies came in and blessed the MBS with investment grade ratings. This blessing ensured that pension funds and other investors would be willing to buy the MBS. The investment-grade ratings were issued despite the problems that analysts recognized with these securities. As one analyst at Standard and Poors’ famously joked, “we’d do a deal if it were structured by cows.” The rating agencies wanted their fees; they didn’t care if they were given investment-grade ratings to MBS that should have been rated as junk."

Norse mythology and the Viking esthetic have provided plenty of fodder for kitsch souvenirs and ideas that we not only sell to tourists but also, to a large extent, buy into ourselves.

It should come as no surprise that the news of a new temple to the Norse gods has drawn such attention: Along with progressive politics and the Nordic welfare model, narratives of the pillaging Vikings and their gods are arguably what make up the total of people’s associations with Scandinavia in much of the world. It’s enough to take a stroll down the main streets of Stockholm’s Old Town — or similar tourist traps in Oslo, or Reykjavik — to realize that Vikings are good for business: Norse-themed dolls, t-shirts, and costumes are for sale at every souvenir store. Horned Viking helmets , sometimes completed with a fringe of blonde hair glued to the rim, are particularly popular. (There is no evidence that the Vikings ever attached horns to their helmets.)

In recent decades, membership in Ásatrúarfélagið has grown to about 2,400 — a not insignificant sum in a country of only 330,000 — and has become the largest non-Christian religious community in Iceland. Ásatrú movements in Sweden, Denmark and Norway are more modest, with members numbering a few hundred in each country, but they are growing steadily.

This current notoriety is a far cry from the humble beginnings of Ásatrúarfélagið. Founded in 1972 by Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson, a sheep farmer and writer of rímur , a form of epic poetry ( here he is, chanting the poetic Edda), the original congregation numbered just about a dozen souls. Nonetheless, in 1973 the association applied for, and received, official recognition as a faith-based organization with the right to perform marriages and funerals as well as to collect congregation tax. The worship of Odin, Thor, Freya and the other gods of the old Norse pantheon became an officially recognized religion exactly 973 years after Iceland’s official conversion to Christianity. This conversion was agreed upon at the Althing in 1000 AD; consensus was reached, with characteristic Scandinavian pragmatism, with the help of three compromises: the new Christians would still be allowed to eat horsemeat, abandon unwanted infants in the wilderness and worship the old gods in the privacy of their homes.

High priest Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson has had a lot on his plate lately. He is the leader of Ásatrúarfélagið, Iceland’s largest association of followers of Ásatrú, the Norse neopagan religion, and ever since news hit the international press that his association would soon be breaking ground on the first temple to the Norse gods in 1000 years , his inbox has been flooded with inquiries from foreign journalists . Ásatrú ceremonies have been disturbed by curious tourists.

No other period in Scandinavian history has become so mythologized. Ideas about our Viking ancestors and our pagan past are inextricably tied to our understanding of our history, culture and national identity. Norse mythology and symbolism has a long history of being used and abused to suit the needs of the time. Interest first surged in the Scandinavian countries during the romantic nationalist period in the 19th century, when it was used in attempts to forge a unified nation and a common ethnic identity. Painters such as Anders Zorn and Carl Larsson explored Norse themes, as did writers such as Erik Gustaf Geijer and composers such as Edvard Grieg. To a large extent, the movement was successful: The imagery and narratives that were developed during this time remain in the popular imagination today.

No less kitsch but all the more troubling is the extensive use of Norse symbols and mythology by Neo-Nazi movements both in and outside Scandinavia. Runic letters and other symbols have become so tied to these groups that their use in any context has become suspect. Excessive interest in Norse mythology carries the whiff of fascism.

Of the Ásatrú movements that exist in Scandinavia today, however, none have any ties to Nazi groups or espouse racist ideologies. Ásatrú in its current form developed in the 1970’s, and has more in common with other alternative nature religions that sprang up at around the same time, such as Wicca and other forms of neoshamanism. They are largely apolitical, with a progressive, environmentalist bent. In the words of Samfundet Forn Sed, the largest Ásatrú association in Sweden, they acknowledge “all humans as equals regardless of gender, origin or sexual preference and shall also uphold religious tolerance in a multicultural society.” Contemporary Ásatrú seeks communion with nature, eschews religious dogma, does not proselytize and allows people of all faiths to partake in ceremonies. In Iceland, Ásatrúarfélagið was an early advocate for same-sex marriage.

As such, the modern Ásatrú followers have probably strayed quite far from the original beliefs and practices of the Norse pagans. The fact is, however, that very little is actually known about these pre-Christian religious belief and practices. What we know of Norse mythology has been gathered from a host of largely secondary sources. Even the Eddas, which remain the major source of knowledge on Norse mythology, were not written down until the 13th century, after couple of centuries of Christian cultural dominance. What we know is so fragmentary that it is not even certain that the different sources describe a single, uniform religion — it’s an open question whether there is an “original” belief at all.

High priest Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson takes this substantial lack of evidence in stride, and is happy to admit that his faith is in large part a creative reimagining of an ancient religion, or “romantiquarianism,” as he calls it. It may well be this very dearth of any certainties is what gives Ásatrú its appeal: In an increasingly secularized and individualist society, it offers a comfortable middle ground. Followers are able to satisfy their spiritual needs within a framework that feels authentic, true to some kind of ancestral identity, but at the same time is empty and flexible enough to fit in with modern values and concerns.

In most of Scandinavia, Ásatrú followers have been largely dismissed, either as blood-obsessed Nazis, or as live action role-players who ended up taking their LARP a little too seriously. Only time will tell, but the Icelandic example suggests that there may be space for a more serious movement. Who knows — it may well be that a revival of Norse paganism is the most fitting religion for our time: The ruthless measures of strength and amoral intrigues of the Icelandic sagas a more perfect mirror for our constant competition under global capitalism; a sustainable life in tune with nature our only salvation; and a pantheon of imperfect gods for our fractured, willful selves."

As in years past, after that day, we will witness anti-Roma riots by neo-Nazis in the Czech Republic, violent protests against Roma by mobs in Bulgaria, evictions by state-paid bulldozers in Serbia, involuntary sterilization by doctors in Slovakia, housing segregation by mayors in Italy, school segregation by pedagogues in Hungary and police brutality in France.

Time and time again, politicians and civil servants across Europe have given in to popular backlash and tolerated organized violence and racism against the Roma. They often fault the Roma for their problems or scapegoat the Roma for public policy failures. For example, European leaders blame Roma for the European Union’s reluctance to extend the Schengen Area — a group of 26 European countries that have eliminated passports and border controls at their common borders — to Romania or to grant visa liberalization to Serbs and Macedonians.

How did we come to the paradox of a politics that commemorates a tragedy for one day and does nothing the rest of the year?

First, racism against Roma is still socially and politically acceptable. And Roma Genocide Remembrance Day alone does not prevent it. A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that anti-Gypsyism is the most widespread form of racism in Europe. A national average of more than 55 percent of respondents in seven countries said they had negative views of Roma. (At the high end of the range, 85 percent of Italians and 66 percent of French did.)

Germany has invested a lot in memory and responsibility for its role in the World War II. In 2005 at a commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz, amid a resurgence of far-right extremism, German then-Chancellor Gerard Schröder proclaimed that his country “bore a special responsibility” for the Holocaust and that the memory of it is part of the German “national identity.”

But for the Roma, the quest for such recognition has been long and arduous. In the decades after World War II, the Roma genocide, sometimes referred to as the forgotten Holocaust, was excluded from the war’s history. It has been argued that the murders of Roma under the Nazi regime were carried out not on racial grounds but because of their asocial nature and criminal records. Not a single Roma witness was called to testify at the Nuremberg trials, and the mass murders of Sinti and Roma received only passing references.

German authorities did not recognize that the Roma were victims of the Holocaust until 1982 and that the sterilization of Roma was part of the “final solution.” A memorial for the Roma genocide was unveiled in Berlin nearly 30 years later."

This is sensational news for Oslo. But it may not be the right strategy for other cities intent on becoming carbon neutral, at least not yet. There are many other ways cities can reduce carbon emissions and air pollution in the near term: by transforming traffic-choked streets into integrated networks for bicycles, e-bikes, public transportation and walking.

Overall, Europe’s urban transportation system is nothing to crow about. But there are affordable, visionary plans to change that by 2030. Worldwide, cities are responsible for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, and transportation is responsible for a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. The battle against climate change must begin at street level.

The imperative to lower emissions in the transportation sector has never been more urgent, especially with world leaders meeting on Nov. 30 at the climate summit in Paris to devise new greenhouse gas targets. At present, Europe isn’t on track to meet its 2030 goal to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent — and transportation is an obvious culprit. In Europe, greenhouse gas emissions by fossil-fuel-powered vehicles, air travel and shipping have risen 27 percent since 1990, even as other sectors have reduced emissions.

It is scandalous that countries such as Germany don’t even have emissions reduction targets for their transport sectors. On the contrary, the automobile and aviation industries are coddled like spoiled children, a fact that this year’s Volkswagen debacle underscored. It wasn’t a coincidence that the German carmaker’s cheating on the emission levels of its diesels — which emit more carbon than gas-powered cars — was uncovered in the United States and not in Europe. Germany’s special treatment of its auto industry also obstructs efforts to cut air and noise pollution. More than 80 percent of Europeans today live in cities with prohibited levels of smog.

The good news is that recent advances in electromobility — spurred by the U.S. automaker Tesla — have put more e-vehicles on the road and cleared the way for a revolution in plug-in, battery-powered vehicles. European automakers have rushed to drop clunky hybrids in favor of models along the lines of the Tesla S, the first plug-in to have a range of over 200 miles and quick-charging batteries. Oslo is the world leader in e-mobility, with much of its street traffic already electric.

Norway is also exceptional in that it generates about 98 percent of its electricity from renewables, mostly hydropower from its abundant mountain lakes and rivers. This means that electric vehicles plugged into charging stations are being juiced up with zero-emission energy. This is the only way that e-mobility makes sense: when the electricity is green and not generated by coal or other fossil fuels. In many countries, the power supplies are so dirty that it makes more sense to drive a high-efficiency conventional vehicle than an e-car."

Stirred by the Arab Spring and the mass protests in Spain and Greece, the occupiers rallied an intergenerational, multiracial, cross-class coalition against the power of the wealthiest 1 percent, behind the banner of “We are the 99 percent.” Their message struck a chord with millions fed up with the federal bailout of the big banks at the expense of ordinary people; chronic indebtedness caused by high student loans, stagnant wages and lack of jobs; the trickle-down economics that had delivered inequality instead of broad prosperity; and the top-down politics that had failed to live up to the promise of democracy.

Yet, from Lower Manhattan to Ferguson, Missouri, and from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter, such nonviolent movements continue to be met with paramilitary tactics and military-grade weaponry meant to maintain “law and order” at any cost. Targeted for arrest, assault and detention, young activists have been equated with criminals, dissidents with domestic terrorists.

This equation has not made us any safer. In fact, there is a growing body of evidence that such tactics lead to more violence, not less, in our streets. A forthcoming study of 192 Occupy protests by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute for Data Science finds that protest violence tends to be provoked by aggressive police tactics — not the other way around. By contrast, when police stand down, protests tend to persist, but with lower rates of arrest and a lower incidence of violence.

The latest data lend credence to our experiences of the Occupy protests, which are documented in a new book by one of the authors that traces the movement from inception to repression. As participants in that movement, we have seen firsthand the propensity of violence to beget more violence. We have also witnessed the human cost of this violence.

In the fall of 2011, we were a couple of twenty-something graduate students who found ourselves drawn to Zuccotti Park, then known as Liberty Square. Both of us participated in the occupation from the start, one of us as a student and labor organizer, the other as a sociologist and citizen journalist. Among other lessons, we were taught by the NYPD the repression of handcuffs, pepper spray and batons.

For two months, the occupiers held the square in the face of daily brutality and thousands of arrests. Similar occupations rose up across the country and faced similar resistance from authorities. In the process, the occupiers sought to take the fight to the financial institutions responsible for the economic crisis, turning it into a political crisis for the “1 percent.”

On Nov. 15, the Wall Street occupation came to an abrupt and violent end, as riot police descended on the park in the dead of night, rounded up its residents and declared the downtown Financial District a “frozen zone.” Similar crackdowns occurred elsewhere, from Oakland, California, to Tampa Bay, Florida, coordinated by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.

On the night of March 17, 2012, we returned to Liberty Square to celebrate the six-month anniversary of Occupy Wall Street. As police encircled the park, an officer seized one of us, Cecily, from behind, snatched her backwards by the breast and slammed her face-first into the concrete; when her elbow accidentally struck her assailant, officers kicked and beat her into a series of seizures. She remained handcuffed, her head repeatedly striking the ground."

While applauding their accomplishments, activists across the country are thinking about the needs of an overlooked demographic: teen mothers.

According to a 2012 report (PDF) by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and America’s Promise Alliance, only 40 percent of teenage mothers graduate high school. The reasons for these low rates vary from student to student. A study published in February by the African American Policy Forum found that teen mothers are often pushed out of school by staff that encourage them to drop out, strict attendance policies and zero-tolerance discipline methods.

Last month, Trameka Pope, a teen mother from Chicago, defied those odds to become the valedictorian of her graduating class. Pope was homeless in grade school and became pregnant in the eighth grade. A cheerleader who works two jobs, she has excelled academically throughout high school. Thanks to her hard work and the support she received from her teachers and counselors, she was accepted into 27 universities and has been awarded more than $600,000 in scholarships. Pope is the perfect example of what young mothers can achieve if given the right support and resources.

I understand the kinds of hurdles these young women are facing. I had my daughter when I was 15 years old. When she realized I was pregnant, my guidance counselor, apparently assuming I wouldn’t graduate high school, half-heartedly discussed my college options but otherwise refused to help me with my college applications. Like Pope, I found encouragement from a few of the teachers at my high school. Without my economics teacher telling me he believed in me, the librarian telling me she thought that I was doing a great job balancing motherhood and being a student and my performance arts teachers allowing me to pump breast milk before rehearsals, I don’t think I would have made it to my high school graduation. And six years after graduating high school — on time and with an honors diploma — I graduated from college.

Teen parents can’t do it alone. Too many of them are confronted with insurmountable circumstances. In one instance reported by the American Civil Liberties Union, a school forced female students to take pregnancy tests; pregnant teens were subsequently kicked out of school. One pregnant teen in Illinois was forced to transfer schools — thereby lengthening her commute — because school staff disagreed with her choice to parent and continue her education. According to the 2012 report, less than 2 percent of teen mothers will graduate from college before the age of 30.

It’s time to change the statistics. Activists around the country are working tirelessly to pass legislation that supports pregnant and parenting teens and their families. It’s an uphill, often isolating battle because many policymakers tend to believe the narrative that teenage parents don’t want to complete their education. But such efforts are ensuring groundbreaking legislation is being passed so young women can reach their potential."

Over the past seven months, the presidential campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist who caucuses with the Democrats, has produced a serious national debate about democratic socialism and the battle to confront inequality in the United States. Sanders has already accomplished far more than most professional commentators had expected, with tens of thousands of people turning out to see him speak. The senator may not have a Super PAC, but his campaign raised $41.5 million as of the last Federal Election Committee filing in October, almost entirely from small donors, becoming the first campaign to reach two million donors this election cycle. Millennials have been donating money to his campaign at an impressive rate. Sanders may yet surprise the political class with strong returns in the opening caucuses and primaries. But sooner or later, all good things must come to an end. Realistically, Sanders’ chances of defeating the Democratic frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are very small. Even if he has performed better than anyone initially gave him credit for, he’s still a long shot, having never led Clinton nationally among Democrats. Moreover, Sanders has vowed that he won’t run as an independent if he loses the primary, for fear of dividing the liberal vote and ensuring a Republican victory. This means that he will likely endorse Clinton, whether or not his supporters approve. It’s not too soon for those supporters to start asking what’s next.

Failures at movement building

Even if Sanders were to pull off a miracle and win the White House, he would need a strong progressive movement to get anything done. “This campaign is not about electing Bernie Sanders for president,” the candidate tweeted last August. “It is about creating a grassroots political movement in this country.” Progressive presidential candidates have often failed to build organizational infrastructure to continue the fight. In 2008, Barack Obama created a remarkable field campaign, Obama For America, which enlisted the largest number of volunteers ever amassed by an American presidential candidate. After his victory, he suggested that the group — which was rebranded Organizing For America (OFA) — would continue as a grassroots advocacy operation. Obama’s camp made much of their plans for OFA and its 13 million-person email list, 4 million donors and 2.5 million activists. “This would be the greatest political organization ever put together, if it works,” said Ed Rollins, a longtime Republican campaign strategist and advisor to President Ronald Reagan, in an interview with Rolling Stone. “No one’s ever had these kinds of resources.” Sadly, many activists energized by the Obama campaign soon found themselves disillusioned with OFA. As the new administration formed, the White House scrapped plans for an independent organizing operation that would put pressure on all politicians. Rather, it wanted loyalists willing to rally in support of the administration’s policy proposals. Ultimately, OFA became a wing of the Democratic National Committee, and its once-mighty grassroots swagger faded into history.

Sanders offers a unique opportunity for progressives to generate fresh energy and draw in people who are otherwise disengaged.

Obama’s inability to channel the energy of his first presidential campaign into a lasting movement is not unique. As Harold Meyerson argued in The Washington Post, “Robert LaFollette’s 1924 independent campaign failed to create an ongoing institution.” Likewise, “the Rainbow Coalition that emerged from Jesse Jackson’s campaigns in the ’80s never had the autonomy it needed to move beyond Jackson’s narrow post-campaign agendas.” But where Democrats have struggled to harness grassroots movements, Republicans have enjoyed more success.

In most cases, infection by Zika has no symptoms, which means the disease is usually not diagnosed. Only 20 percent of Zika cases are accompanied by symptoms such as fever and rash. The disease, which originated in Brazil, has spread to almost 30 other countries and territories, including the United States, where at least 82 cases have been reported.

The real danger of Zika occurs when a pregnant woman contracts the disease. The Zika virus is associated with the birth defect microcephaly, in which infants are born with smaller-than-normal heads. Microcephaly can cause a range of health issues such as seizures, developmental delays and hearing and vision problems. Though scientists are not completely certain Zika causes microcephaly, mounting evidence suggest a link between the two. While the Zika virus is transmitted through mosquito bites, climate change could be the real driver of this outbreak.

Climate change is typically associated with rising sea levels and extreme weather. But our warming climate may also make it easier for certain diseases to spread, particularly those transmitted by mosquitoes. The insects need warm temperatures to survive and standing or slow-moving water to reproduce. Climate change’s increased rainfall and higher temperatures can combine to make it easier for mosquitoes to extend their life spans and increase the areas where they can survive. This means that Zika can travel farther and outbreaks can last longer because the mosquitoes that spread the disease are more viable.

Zika is not the only disease that can benefit from climate change. In 1999 researchers estimated that 320 million more people would be at risk for malaria in 2080 because of climate change, in large part because mosquitoes are able to survive longer in warmer climates. In 1998 researchers predicted that climate change would increase the potential for a global dengue fever epidemic by nearly half. While we have yet to see a global dengue epidemic, the disease is spreading to areas where it was rarely seen before. On Feb. 8, the mayor of Hawaii County declared a state of emergency due to an outbreak of mosquito-borne dengue fever. Hawaii had more than 250 confirmed cases of dengue since September 2015.

Chikungunya, another mosquito-borne virus, could be following the same pattern. Before 2006, chikungunya was rarely identified in the United States, but in 2014 and 2015, more than 3,400 cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

Nelson, who runs Trail Posse, an online platform that promotes diversity in the outdoors, explains that people of color are only about half as likely to visit national parks as whites. He offers two reasons for this disparity: People of color are less familiar with parks and therefore hesitant to go, and there is a lack of racial diversity among the nation’s park employees. However, it is not just unfamiliarity with the parks that keeps people of color away. Many prospective visitors worry about disparate treatment by and implicit racial bias of park staffers. Nelson refers to jokes made by his road trip companions, including one in which they expected whites-only signs at the national park entrances. Unfortunately, those jokes are not that far from the truth. African-Americans are less likely to visit parks for fear of racist treatment by mostly white park rangers, gate agents and other park staffers. It is therefore critical to assess and eliminate these inherent biases that exclude people of color from outdoor public spaces. According to a 2009 survey by the University of Wyoming and the National Park Service (NPS), whites accounted for 78 percent of the national parks’ visitors from 2008 to 2009; Hispanics, 9 percent; African-Americans, 7 percent; and Asian-Americans, 3 percent. When compared with their share of the U.S. population, white park visitors are overrepresented by 14 percentage points, whereas African-Americans were underrepresented by 6 percentage points. Whites are overrepresented not only as visitors but also as park employees. According to a 2013 report by the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, 80 percent of NPS employees were white. And the National Park Foundation’s 22-member board, whose mission is to support the NPS through fundraising, has only four minorities.



Race/ethnicity of NPS visitors vs. U.S. population

African-Americans and Hispanics list various reasons for not visiting national parks, including the high cost of food and lodging, lack of outreach and information about parks, safety concerns and poor service by NPS employees. The limited outreach to African-American communities is rooted in the stereotype that black people don’t do nature. The disparate treatment of black visitors and misconceptions about African-Americans relations with the outdoors is part of the United States’ legacy of racial violence and segregation. In this dynamic, park rangers and park police often make African-American visitors feel unwelcome.

The National Park Service has a responsibility to make our parks safe and welcoming spaces for all Americans.

Last month we learned firsthand about the racist mistreatment of African-American park visitors during a scholarly event at Yosemite National Park in California. By inviting a diverse group of women to the park, we inadvertently carried out a study of racial profiling by park gate agents. As part of our event, eight female academics — four of them white or Hispanic and four African-American — drove into the park. The organizers told participants not to pay the entrance fee and to inform gate agents that their fees were waived because they were visiting the research station. The white and Hispanic drivers gave the agents the information as directed and were welcomed and waved through. The four African-American scholars entered the park at different times and entrances and gave the same information. In all four cases, the African-American professors were extensively questioned, made to fill out a superfluous form, which required extra and unnecessary effort and a check-in with the research center staff, and reluctantly let into the park. One of the black professors was questioned about her college degrees, the title of her research project and her university affiliation and was asked to provide a faculty ID. The agents appeared incapable of imagining that a black woman could hold a Ph.D. and visit a research station for a scholarly event. (The Yosemite National Park Service has since opened an investigation into the incidents.) This is heartbreaking, not least because Buffalo Soldiers, members of all-African-American regiments of the U.S. Army, were among the nation’s first park rangers and built the first marked trail at Yosemite. Today only 1 percent of the park’s visitors are black.

But look closely at the recovery and you can see another story: how government policy helps the affluent, not the desperate. House prices are rising, home sales are increasing, and new building permits in May were up 30 percent from a year earlier, though that just restored them to 1994’s level. And while America has enjoyed a record 64 straight months of job growth, wages barely budged for most workers, making housing costs for many Americans a continuing struggle. By contrast, the recovery has been much faster for the big banks, where many top executives remain in charge who got rich issuing mortgages that they knew were unlikely to ever be repaid.

Jumbo loan growth

On the consumer side, despite low inflation and modest wage gains, house prices are on the rise in large parts of America, especially urban areas with strong job growth such as the California coast, Puget Sound and near the nation’s capital. When housing prices rise faster than incomes, it suggests a bubble, as I warned about in 2004. The bubble was the result of inflated appraisals that 11,000 honest appraisers tried to stop as big banks abandoned traditional underwriting, in which they check income and credits to see if a loan can be repaid. This time around, however, that home prices are rising faster than incomes reflects other factors. As anyone who has obtained a mortgage recently can tell you, borrowers now get run through a financial wringer even if they bring a big down payment and flawless credit history. Significantly, The biggest mortgage growth is in jumbo loans. These are mortgages for more than $417,000 in most markets, though the threshold can be as high as $625,500 in high-cost markets such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Honolulu. Jumbos cannot be resold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored corporations whose purpose is to ensure a ready market for mortgages. They buy loans only below those thresholds. In San Francisco more than 38 percent of mortgages this year were jumbos, up from 17.6 percent just three years ago. More than 1 in 5 Los Angeles mortgages is jumbo. In Detroit, America’s desperation capital, just 1.9 percent are jumbos, but that is more than double the rate in 2012. Contrast the lower end of the housing market. Many big banks do not accept applications from people who want to borrow $100,000 or less to buy a home or refinance. And those that do sometimes propose fees that total 10 percent or more of the proposed loan, a subtle way of saying “Go away.” And what of those living in the many parts of America where you need only $50,000 to buy a decent small house or apartment? Lenders are few because the complex new regulations that Congress enacted in the wake of the 2008 crisis raise their costs. There were simpler solutions to prevent fraud, but lobbying by banks and contributions from bankers made sure we got a costly Rube Goldberg regulatory machine instead of effective and simple reform.

The disparity in the housing recovery between homeowners and bankers illustrates how government policy continues to tilt in favor of ‘the haves and the have mores.’

So the housing recovery is really a story of high-end homes, not mass housing. And that fits perfectly with the trend of the last 35 years of government being a problem for the many but a boon to the few. Keep in mind that incomes at the very top are skyrocketing while the bottom 90 percent of earners are back to the inflation-adjusted income levels of the mid-1960s.

Too big to fail

As for the big banks, they are enjoying a much faster and more robust recovery than the housing market. In the last few years, bank profits reached record levels, softened a bit by tens of billions of dollars in civil penalties (which came out of the wealth of not executives but shareholders). Still, some bank valuation increases are stunning. Anyone who bought JPMorgan Chase at its 2009 low today enjoys a bulging wallet. Dividends and raising share prices combined produced a return of almost $5 for each buck invested back then. Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is now a billionaire, thanks to his $27 million annual pay, the rising stock market and his escaping personal responsibility for what the Justice Department said were mortgages that never should have been sold. This disparity in the housing recovery between homeowners and bankers illustrates how government policy continues to tilt in favor of “the haves and the have mores,” as George W. Bush once jokingly described his base. Central to this disparity is that Washington bailed out the banks, not the borrowers. Worse, Barack Obama’s administration declined to prosecute easily proved crimes by the big banks, including filing false documents, wire and mail fraud and fraudulently marketing securities. Homeowners might also be in much better shape had the Obama administration early on embraced a smart idea to have the Federal Reserve buy up mortgages. Obama turned his back on this in part because one of its proponents was Glenn Hubbard, the Columbia University business school dean who was the Bush administration’s top economic adviser. Hubbard told me this week that the time for the reform he proposed in 2008 has now passed.

Media reports suggest that ISIL has a major base in the North African state and that its fighters are poised to infiltrate Europe, smuggling their fighters across the Mediterranean using migrant trafficking networks. Other reports indicate that thousands of young radicals from around the world are flooding into Libya to join ISIL’s ranks.

Not only are these reports misleading, but they also detract from Libya’s deep political crisis. Libya remains entangled in a protracted conflict that no side is strong enough to win. Since the ouster in 2011 of Libya’s longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, the country has been at the mercy of various armed groups and brigades. Libyan authorities have failed to bring these groups into line or impose any centralized control.

Two competing political authorities have dominated Libya since August 2014, when a coalition of brigades known as Operation Libya Dawn took over the capital, Tripoli. On one side is the House of Representatives, the officially recognized parliament. Elected in June 2014, it is holed up in the remote eastern town of Tobruk. On the other side is the General National Congress. Although its electoral mandate expired in February 2014, Operation Libya Dawn reinstated the group after its victory. Both sides claim sole legislative authority, boast their own military forces and are competing for control of Libya’s national institutions.

The United Nations has been trying to bring the two groups together to negotiate a new political road map and national unity government. But its efforts have thus far come to naught; neither side is willing to compromise and relinquish power. More important, the real players behind the two forces — Gen. Khalifa Haftar and the Libyan National Army behind the House and the various brigades and militias that make up Operation Libya Dawn — still seek a military rather than political solution.

Despite the permissive security environment resulting from this deadlock, ISIL’s Libya branch remains fragmented, weak and caught up in localized power struggles. For example, media reports have portrayed the northeastern coastal town of Derna as an ISIL stronghold. But ISIL is just one among an array of militant groups operating there. In fact, ISIL is considerably weaker than the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council, a coalition of rebel groups that came together in 2014 to fight Haftar’s forces. Since June 9, when ISIL fighters killed its deputy, Nasser al-Aker, the Derna Council has launched a series of major attacks against ISIL. The ensuing clashes demonstrated that ISIL controlled only certain pockets and areas of the town, from which it has now been largely pushed out.

ISIL has a more definite hold in the coastal city of Sirte and the nearby towns of Nawfaliya and Harawa. Yet, contrary to claims about the influx of foreign fighters, ISIL fighters in these towns are mostly local men who previously belonged to Libyan Islamist group Ansar Al-Sharia.

“The group whose members are keen on calling themselves ISIL are the same as Ansar Al-Sharia,” Muftah Marzouq of the Sirte Elders’ Council told a local reporter in March. “All of them are from the town. We know them and their families personally.” The militants, who were already providing security in their local areas, adopted the ISIL brand simply as a means of bolstering their power and prestige."

Roughly 120 people die of a drug overdose everyday. Among white Americans ages 25 to 34 the overdose death rate in 2014 was five times its 1999 level, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The number of people now dying from drug overdose is comparable to the number dying annually from AIDS during the peak of the AIDS epidemic in the mid-90s,” Talking Points Memo editor Josh Marshall wrote on Jan. 26. The comparison puts the current drug-overdose epidemic in perspective, but the more important parallel here is that both crises were caused, at least in part, by inequality and the deprivation and despair that inequality creates.

Inequality became understood as a public health problem with the introduction in 1995 of the Fundamental Causes approach, which maintains that access to economic and social resources have a huge influence on health. Moreover, while the immediate causes of health disparities may vary, social inequalities such as poverty, discrimination and prejudice will always have a negative effect on health through one mechanism or another.

The HIV/AIDS and drug overdose epidemics are perfect examples of how socioeconomic inequalities affect public health. In the case of HIV/AIDS, HIV stigma can push people to do things that might transmit the disease, like having unprotected sex. And those facing such stigma are more likely to have poor access to health care. In other words, stigmatizing HIV-positive people can lead to unnecessary AIDS-related deaths.

Income inequality is one of the main drivers of the increase in drug-overdose deaths. Similar increases in alcohol-related deaths and suicide have also been ascribed to the rising income gap. In fact, the increase in drug overdose deaths appears to mirror an increase in economic inequality in the United States since mid-1980s."

It’s a quick and dirty tactic, demanding little factual basis to assert that one’s political enemies are officially the Worst. It’s employed so often that it has a name: reductio ad Hitlerum.

Though often absurd, the comparison is far from harmless rhetoric. Invoking Hitler or the Nazis does more than express vast condemnation; it’s a war cry. The lesson of the 20th Century was, after all, never to turn a blind eye or to compromise with Nazis.

On Tuesday night at the World Zionist Congress in Jerusalem, Netanyahu went further than the average Nazi cheap shot. He said that the Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini — not Adolf Hitler — came up with the idea of the Final Solution to exterminate the Jews. So if Hitler has been inscribed in our collective historical dictionary as the Worst, Netanyahu’s comments suggest that Palestinians are even worse still.

Censure has rained on the Israeli leader for his pernicious historical fiction — while a profound anti-Semite, al-Husseini was not the Final Solution’s creator. The Israeli opposition, Palestinian leaders and historians interpreted the comment as implying that Hitler be exonerated of blame for the Holocaust. “It is a sad day in history when the leader of the Israeli government hates his neighbor so much that he is willing to absolve the most notorious war criminal in history,” said Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

But the Israeli prime minister obviously had no intention of exculpating the Nazis; his aim was to posit anti-Semitism as foundational and inextricable from anti-Zionism and the Palestinian struggle. What could better serve than a fiction in which the mufti guides the Fuhrer? Netanyahu well knows that there’s no risk of Hitler being dethroned from historical position of archmonster. Netanyahu’s bellicose reasoning has little regard for the logic of superlatives — he would help Israel to as many ur-enemies as possible.

Netanyahu has not apologized for his remarks, even after Chancellor Angela Merkel was compelled to reassert German responsibility for the Holocaust — the sine qua non of modern German identity. When challenged by a reporter on his controversial statement, Netanyahu doubled down, but with a revealing twist: “Hitler was responsible for the Holocaust,” he said, adding “I think no one should deny … important testimony about the mufti of Jerusalem, that he told the Nazis to prevent the fleeing of Jews from Europe, and that he supported the Final Solution.”

A flurry of satirical responses on social media have riffed on Netanyahu’s distorted revisionism. “Not many people know this, but initially, Eve only wanted to sniff the apple. But then, during a meeting with the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, he convinced her to take a bite off of it,” wrote one Twitter user under the hashtag #MuftiSays. (The mufti no doubt also killed Kennedy and broke up the Beatles.) The meme rightly skewers the absurdity of Netanyahu’s historical fiction but misses the ideology underpinning it. The mufti Holocaust story is not just a pernicious but expedient fabrication to fuel hatred for Palestinians — and Netanyahu most likely wasn’t lying when he said it. He believes in the story, or at least, in the mythology of the story. Factual incorrectness is beside the point; it’s not difficult to find out that at least 33,000 Jews had been exterminated by SS mobile killing units before Hitler and the mufti met."

Bernie Sanders’ public defense of socialism in the Oct. 13 Democratic presidential debate has kicked off America’s first major discussion of the idea in more than a generation. Columnists, talk show hosts and Donald Trump have all joined in. Most of the discussion, however, has been wildly misleading, and almost all of it has bypassed some of the most interesting forms of a very American and practical form of socialism emerging throughout the United States.

Sanders was clear about what he meant by socialism, pointing to Denmark as a positive example. But Denmark is a capitalist nation with a record of welcoming and supporting private business investment. The word “socialism” is used there — as it is in many European countries — to describe a strong welfare state that includes comprehensive health care, a solid safety net, generous retirement benefits, day care and many other programs that almost any American progressive would support.

The American term for this kind of system — capitalism with a strong welfare state — is, in fact, liberalism or, perhaps, when combined with very tough taxes on the rich and corporations, populism. Socialism, on the other hand, historically has gone far beyond progressive welfare state measures by asserting that a democratic society can be achieved only if it includes democratic ownership of the economy.

In many European countries, strong labor movements committed to socialism as strong liberalism have helped counterbalance the power of capital by supporting a stronger welfare state. However, this option has always been constrained in the U.S., where union membership has declined from 35.4 percent of the labor force at its peak in the early 1950s to a mere 11.1 percent today. Racism and other factors historically have weakened and divided the American labor movement and almost entirely prevented union organizing in the South.

In sector after sector, corporate lobbyists strongly influence political outcomes in connection with everything from health care to prison and poverty programs. Ownership is concentrated: The 400 richest Americans control more wealth than the poorest 186 million — and as modern election and lobbying studies all too regularly show, with that wealth comes political power.

The environmental implications of this power are particularly grave. Regulating the big oil companies to reduce global warming is even harder, politically, than regulating the banks. Large Wall Street–financed corporations must show consistent growth; in the case of the oil companies, unrestricted growth is increasingly understood as ecologically unsustainable.

Sanders’ comment during the debate that “Congress does not regulate Wall Street — Wall Street regulates Congress” speaks to this reality, but his hope that breaking up the big banks will solve the problem is fundamentally liberal. A traditional socialist would more likely argue that only by nationalizing the banks could their power truly be curbed."

Salaita will receive roughly $600,000 after lawyer fees and will not be teaching at the university.

“Yes, there was some dispute as to whether he was actually officially hired in the first place, but a federal court found decisively in Salaita’s favor,” Stanford University Prof. David Palumbo-Liu wrote in Salon. The judge declared: “Simply put, the University cannot argue with a straight face that it engaged in all these actions in the absence of any obligation or agreement” to complete Salaita’s hiring process.

Salaita has indeed obtained some measure of vindication. He will receive a significant sum of money from the university, and Chancellor Phyllis Wise, who originally rescinded the offer after extensive pressure from donors, was unceremoniously fired. Regardless of one’s views of Salaita’s tweets critical of Israel’s military operations in Gaza, there is no doubt his dehiring was a clear violation of free speech and academic freedom and did him significant harm.

But the settlement falls far short of a victory. The size of the settlement pales in comparison to the upwards of $3,000,000 he would have earned at UIUC in salaries and benefits had he worked there for the rest of his scholarly career. For her part, Wise remains a highly paid faculty member at UIUC, with an annual salary nearly as large as Salaita’s total net settlement.

What’s more, as part of the settlement, the university did not have to admit any wrongdoing.

Has the Salaita affair in fact come to a conclusion with this agreement? As Salaita himself put it in a piece for The Nation describing his feelings about the settlement, “It’s settled, then. Only it’s not.” In so writing, Salaita directly compared the settlement of his case to the Zionist settling of Palestinian land, in the sense of obtaining a legal result through coercive means. It’s a fair analogy. One of the chief ways that Zionist leaders gained control of territory in Palestine before 1948 was through the courts, by fixing or “settling” the title to lands they had purchased. Ostensibly these agreements were made with the “owners,” but rarely if ever with the long-term occupants who, under existing laws, had the right to remain on the land as long as they used it productively.

This led the Zionist movement to deploy already well-established colonial tropes meant to dislodge indigenous peoples from their lands around the world. They provided supposed proof that natives were incapable of using their lands productively, thus justifying their displacement in favor of more modern, productive and efficient Europeans."

The increase is concentrated among whites with meager educations and is “largely accounted for by increasing death rates from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis,” according to two Princeton University scholars, one of whom was just awarded the Nobel in economics. Their findings should awaken Americans to the price we pay for pursuing economic policies that enrich the few at the expense of the many. Drug and alcohol use that results in death from either poisoning or chronic disease, as well as increased self-extermination, point to social pathologies fostered by government policies that favor moving jobs offshore, reducing wages, restricting access to health care and enabling age discrimination in hiring.

Macabre data

There is good reason to think worsening economic conditions are at the heart of what the Princeton economists — Anne Case and Angus Deaton, the new Nobel laureate — found by simply analyzing published mortality data. Case and Deaton, who are married, found “declines in self-reported health, mental health and ability to work, increased reports of pain, and deteriorating measures of liver function all point to increasing midlife distress,” according to their paper published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We’ll return to that in a moment, but first, let’s get a handle on the enormity of this macabre trend among middle-aged white Americans. Every 75 minutes, a white middle-aged American dies who would be alive had the United States simply maintained the mortality level of that group in 1998. That’s about 7,000 unnecessary deaths per year. Worse, every 16 minutes, a white middle-aged American dies who would be alive had the trend of falling death rates from 1979 through 1998 continued its downward trajectory for the next 15 years. That comes to a half million extra deaths among middle-aged white Americans from 1999 to 2013. Many of these added deaths stem from drug and alcohol poisoning and diseases from chronic use, the data show. The use of prescription painkillers, as well as illegal drugs such as heroin that tamp down emotional pain, is on the rise, especially in states where limited educations are common. In Alabama, among the poorest states, doctors wrote 143 prescriptions for opioids such as Oxycontin for every 100 residents in 2012 — the highest rate in the nation. Tennessee doctors write such prescriptions at more than 21 times the rate of Minnesota doctors.

Social pathologies

That the death rate for middle-aged American whites, especially those with meager educations, started rising at the turn of the century fits the economic data that I have been analyzing for years. The harsh reality is that our economy is in many ways stuck in 1998 and that for poorly educated Americans, the economy has become a living nightmare with no expectation of a brighter tomorrow.

The rise in drug and alcohol poisonings as well as the rising tide of suicides should not surprise. But these trends should disturb.

In a society based on paid work, long-term unemployment can be devastating to self-esteem, social attachment and life planning. Joblessness and uncertain work promote despair and alcohol abuse. Alcohol dependence is worst among the unemployed and is higher among those with a high school education or less than among those with a college degree or more, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in America and accounts for a large portion of the rising death toll among middle-aged whites. In 2013, CDC data show, more than 41,000 people took their own lives, more than 32,000 of them men. Suicide is far more common among white men than black men. While people commit suicide for many reasons, suicides are a canary-in-the-mineshaft indicator of societal pathologies. Economic shocks, especially the loss of reliable income, can result in a significant increase in suicides, as Russian society experienced soon after the collapse of the Soviet empire.

It is as if a giant dam thrown up to block human progress has begun to spill over the top, the outpouring growing until the dam collapses, a flood of decency, fairness and respect washing the stains of discrimination, exploitation and oppression. Before June 17, many Americans were already feeling revulsion towards our country’s legacy of white supremacy after seeing numerous cellphone videos of police attacking innocent blacks. Then Dylann Roof massacred nine worshippers at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Suddenly and unexpectedly the vile nature of the Confederate battle flag, waved with pride by Roof in several photos released after the shooting, became obvious to so many people that within a week Southern politicians scurried away from that symbol of racist hatred. This is just the beginning. We will see more positive change in the near future as those who solicit votes through fear and denunciation watch America move toward its founding ideals: that all people are created equal with inalienable rights and that America does best when our government follows the six noble purposes of our Constitution, especially promoting the general welfare.

The repulsive flag

In the Old South the Confederate battle flag flies above state capitals and business, appears on license plates and adorns apparel. Yet less than a week after Roof murdered nine people at a church prayer meeting, Southern politicians are scrambling to get rid of it. A host of retailers — Amazon, Wal-Mart, Sears and K-Mart, Target, EBay and Etsy among them — said they would stop selling the flags while the leading manufacturer, Valley Forge Flag, said it will stop making them. The Supreme Court played a role, too, deciding June 18 that Texans had no right to license plates embossed with that flag. Hopefully the high court will someday uphold an administrative decision invalidating the racist trademark of the football team in the nation’s capital. In the South many people, including some of my paternal relatives, talk not of the Civil War, but the War of Northern Aggression. Many assert that the flag is a symbol of “Southern pride,” though it is a pride not shared by those Americans whose ancestors were bought, sold and disposed of by the fewer than 2 percent of Southerners who owned slaves. After the Charleston attack politicians who once supported the flag and its “heritage” see it now as a symbol of racists whose attack on U.S. soldiers at Fort Sumter ultimately cost 750,000 American lives. Anyone flying that banner should be treated with all the opprobrium due anyone hoisting the old Soviet hammer and sickle. It is a flag of traitors. Those who say the flag honors their ancestors should thank the victors for their graciousness in not hanging those ancestors who were political or military officers. That would have been an entirely lawful and appropriate response, but preserving and strengthening the union mattered more than revenge.

People get misled from time to time, but reality ultimately intrudes.

The sudden recognition of the Confederate battle flag as despicable comes after a cluster of videos showed unjustified police attacks on a host of black Americans who had committed no crime. These include the shooting of a man at a gas station in Columbia, South Carolina, as he complied with orders to get his driver's license, an older man hauled from his car and beaten for driving in a white Detroit suburb after dark (and, evidently, police planting drugs in the car to justify their crimes), a police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, emptying his gun at an unarmed man running away and a 15-year-old girl in a bikini being manhandled by a cop at a pool party in McKinney, Texas. These videos have prompted widespread revulsion among Americans. They followed partial recognition that police harassment of black youths sparked the riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore.

Around the globe, we are seeing strong downward pressure on prices, especially for commodities, prompting some governments to make their currency cheaper relative to the dollar. That suggests we may be entering a period of deflation, last experienced in a serious way in the U.S. in the Great Depression of the 1930s and the late 1800s. A deflationary spiral would represent a serious threat to the global economy.

Currency war

Let’s look at the currency fight. To bolster its exports, and thus jobs, Beijing last week cut the price of the yuan, relative to the dollar, by about 4 percent. More than a fifth of American trade is with China, so the relative price of the yuan and dollar matters a lot to both countries. A cheaper yuan helps China export more manufactured goods, because Americans (and others) can buy them at lower cost. This also means it will cost the Chinese more to buy American products, so fewer will be sold. In June China sold $1 billion per day more to the U.S. than it purchased. If the yuan falls 10 percent it, will make Chinese goods so much cheaper that our trade deficit with China will likely increase by about $66 billion annually. That translates into a likely loss of 190,000 to 640,000 American jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Since 2000 the U.S. has lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs, the majority of them to China. The U.S. could stanch this by buying yuan for, say, 5 to the dollar. At that price currency traders would be hunting for every Chinese coin stuck between couch cushions. Chinese leaders would not take well to this and would, in turn, come up with their own responses to mitigate the effect of such a currency war because their interest is fixed on China’s long march to becoming the next superpower. But it’s not just China that is devaluing its currency so it can lower the price of exports. The South Korean won, Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit have all come down in recent days and the Vietnamese dong is sure to follow as these countries try to make their exports cheaper and protect their manufacturing jobs. The Australian dollar, which floats freely because it is not managed by the government, also fell in the markets. All this makes the dollar relatively stronger, which reduces American exports and manufacturing jobs. For the U.S. the stronger dollar will also put even more downward pressure on wages as manufacturers try to find ways to make products competitive and overcome the stronger dollar. That would in turn worsen the already weak spending capacity of most Americans, adding to deflationary pressures as sellers trim the prices of goods and services.

research.stlouisfed.org

Another way to make the dollar cheaper is by lowering interest rates — except that they are already so low. The effective Federal Funds rate is a tiny fraction of one percent, 0.13 percent to be precise. The discount rate, what the Fed charges banks for overnight loans to smooth cash flows, has been at 0.75 percent since 2010, down from 5.75 percent in early 2001. The Federal Reserve keeps hinting it will abandon its zero-interest-rate policy as early as this fall. But lifting interest rates will make the dollar even more attractive as a safe storehouse of cash. So higher interest mean an even stronger dollar as more money flows into American debt securities, which means fewer American exports and more lost jobs and that, in turn, means pressure on sellers to lower prices to avoid being stuck with unsold goods and services. It’s a vicious cycle we want to avoid.

The falls in prices around the world raise the specter of deflation.

Loss of purchasing power

Meanwhile commodity prices around the world have fallen, an indication of an economic slowdown or even the start of a contraction, as Japan just reported. This especially hits the Brazilian economy, the world’s seventh largest, since it relies heavily on exporting iron ore, petroleum and other commodities to China, for which it will be relatively less. Oil may fall to under $20 a barrel from its July 2008 high of $146, according to Barron’s, the weekly magazine for individuals who trade stocks. Oil traded at about $48 last week. At $20, it would be a short-term disaster for oil-field towns, where the falling price has already resulted in fewer drilling rigs, shutting some operating wells and fewer support jobs. The falls in prices around the world raise the specter of deflation. The underlying global problem is that while profits have soared and corporations hold vast hoards of cash, few workers worldwide are getting real pay raises and many have seen their incomes fall in real terms. Their lack of purchasing power has lowered aggregate demand. My analysis of new IRS data shows that, adjusted for inflation, the bottom half of Americans reported average total incomes (excluding welfare benefits like food stamps) of just $14,775 in 2012, down 18 percent from 2003. Most people’s income derives from work. When pay is stagnant the capacity of people to buy more goods and services also must be flat unless they go into debt. One way we have seen this in the U.S. is that the average age of cars on the road has increased from 8.4 years in 1995 to 11.4 years in 2014. We are slowly becoming less well off. China faces similar problems. Angst among its newly created urban classes, who were sold on a bigger economic future through capitalism but feel the sting of rising prices and small wage increases, threatens party control. Cheap foreign currencies convey some benefits. The American dollar is worth about $1.31 in Canada, making vacations and shopping there very attractive to those of us who live near the border. Airfares are even better deal. I was about to pay $1,452 in airfare to speak at the 2015 Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Norway when I looked up airfares out of Toronto. I paid just $695 and get to have dinner with a daughter who lives in Canada. Had I waited a month my airfare would have been just $515.

Ted Cruz won the Iowa Republican caucuses with a four percent edge over businessman-turned presidential candidate Donald Trump. The loss by the GOP frontrunner may come as a relief for some.

Trump is not the only Republican contender spouting anti-immigrant rhetoric, but he’s been one of the most vocal and vitriolic. The New York billionaire does not even attempt to shroud his racism. For example, announcing his presidential bid in June, Trump said of Mexican immigrants, whom he referred to as “rapists,” that “they bring drugs” and “they bring crime.”

At the time, I promised myself that I wouldn’t write about him. Not only did I want to avoid expending energy on such a pitiful and detestable candidate, as a daughter of formerly undocumented Mexican immigrants, it hurt me to fully examine what his presence signified for us in this country.

My parents immigrated to the United States in 1978. They crossed the Tijuana border through the desert with a coyote, then passed the Border Patrol check points by riding in the trunk of a Cadillac. Like many immigrants, they were escaping the bleak economic realities of their birthplace. They have now lived in the United States much longer than they ever lived in Mexico and are as American as anyone else in this country. I grew up in Chicago, and though I often felt I had two conflicting cultural identities, I too am very much American. In fact, I would argue that this experience is quintessentially American. Except for Native Americans, we are either immigrants or descend from them. That should be obvious, but it seems as if many politicians forget this fact.

My parents, along with 3 million other immigrants, were fortunate to be granted amnesty in 1986, thanks to Ronald Reagan, who — ironically— is the patron saint of many conservatives. Reagan’s immigration reform allowed my parents to work legally, so they no longer had to live in fear of deportation. Although they experienced poverty, exploitation and discrimination, they were, and continue to be, grateful to be here.

One moment in which I understood our status in this country was when I was at a diner with my mother. I was 15 or so, and as usual, I was in charge of ordering because of my mother’s limited English. The waitress scowled at us and then turned around and gleefully chatted with the white patrons at the next table. I was both enraged and dumbfounded, and left a note that said, “Mexicans are people, too.” Clearly, we were different; we were not welcome. And these kinds of experiences were not infrequent. People in public spaces would glare at us when we spoke Spanish to each other, as if this somehow offended them.

Fast forward nearly three decades and, I would argue that the general sentiment toward immigrants is worse than it was then. Conservatives, looking for the scapegoat for all of America’s ills, from the economy to crime, have pointed their finger at this already vulnerable group of people."

But if procreation were an act of pure beneficence, parents would owe nothing further to its beneficiary, for whom they have already done more than anyone will ever again be able to do. We think, on the contrary, that parents owe their offspring more than anyone else will ever owe them — a loving home, a good upbringing, an education. Life itself is less a gift than a gamble, and a newborn needs many years of loving care in order to make the best of it. The child is owed that loving care, and the debt falls in the first instance to the parents who created him, since they are the causes of his needing it.

Some procreators declare parental bankruptcy and pass their obligations to others by putting their offspring up for adoption. They do so reluctantly, out of concern for the best interests of the child. If people defaulted on their parental obligations casually, solely out of self-interest, we would be shocked and appalled.

Come to think of it, there are such people, and we are indeed appalled by them. They’re the people we call deadbeat dads and moms — those who owe support to their children but do not provide it.

Yet if we are appalled by people who casually default on their obligations to offspring, then there is another category of people who ought to appall us. How odd, then, that we celebrate them as philanthropists, by calling them donors: donors of sperm and eggs. What is the difference between the parents we call deadbeats and the ones we call donors?

Of course, the deadbeats are legally on the hook for child support, whereas the donors have secured a prior release from parental obligations. The problem, as I see it, is that the recipient of the gametes, who takes over the donor parent’s obligations, is not the party to whom those obligations were owed and hence not the one entitled to grant the release. Parental obligations are owed to the child, who cannot consent to the transaction. And unlike parents who give up a child for adoption without its consent, the donor and the recipient have no justification for going ahead without it. An adoptee is like a patient who arrives in the emergency room unconscious and in need of emergency surgery. Ruling out surgery in the absence of the patient’s consent would entail leaving him to die; similarly, ruling out adoption in the absence of the adoptee’s consent would entail leaving some infants without a family. But ruling out donor conception in the absence of the child’s consent would entail nothing worse than leaving it never to be born. Prospective parents cannot be absolved of their obligations to a future child by the urgency of rescuing him from nonexistence.

Some obligations can be delegated to someone else without the consent of the one to whom they are owed. If you promised to mow a friend’s lawn while she is away, you don’t have to get her consent before hiring someone else to do the job. But if a close friend lands in the hospital, you may have an obligation to visit her, and you can’t just hand that job off to someone else — not, at least, without asking whether your friend would welcome the proxy visitor — and even then, you’d better have a good reason for outsourcing an obligation of friendship. Obligations of friendship may require in-person performance, because they arise out of a personal connection."

But now that expanding mounds of uncollected garbage have made life in Beirut and other cities an uncomfortable embarrassment, the Lebanese people have all but had it. Over the weekend, an explosion of anti-government political demonstrations shattered established sectarian political rules that have defined the country since its birth in the 1930s.

Citizens widely believe that the garbage has gone uncollected because of a combination of government incompetence and corruption. Their discontent quickly morphed into dramatic calls for the resignation of the government and parliament. Anger shot through the roof when police tear-gassed and shot rubber bullets at peaceful demonstrators Saturday night.

Ordinary citizens declared they would no longer accept mistreatment and abuse at the hands of their leaders; humiliated, frustrated and helpless, they decided to take to the street to demand real change in how power is exercised and how the country is managed.

This brought Lebanon into line with other Arab societies that since 2011 have risen up in protest against oppressive or corrupt central governments.

The nearly 20,000 mostly peaceful protesters who showed up at the prime minister’s office and parliament on Sunday went to express their anger over the trash and other problems and annoyances that have plagued them all year. These include electricity cuts for 12 to 14 hours per day in some places, dwindling fresh water supplies, rising commodity prices, few new jobs, a dilapidated public transport infrastructure and no policy to deal with the multiple economic and environmental effects of the 1.3 million Syrian refugees in a country of 4 million citizens.

These practical matters are not impossible to resolve, but the deeper problems that this weekend’s protests speak to are much harder to fix. Lebanon has a deadlocked political system, with leaders who seldom experience the same daily inconveniences and frustrations as their constituents. The country has had no elected president for more than a year; its moribund parliament has extended its term because it could not agree on a new election law; the Lebanese Cabinet barely meets and can’t seem to reach consensus on any issues, big or small; and key political and sectarian factions such as Hezbollah, the Future Movement, the Amal Party and the Free Patriotic Movement have not met formally to attempt conciliation for years.

Lebanese politicians have turned their government into a big joke, but their people aren’t laughing. The garbage piles, for many demonstrators, reflect a corrupt, incompetent and uncaring political system that cannot or will not change.

The weekend’s demonstrations were organized by an informal group of activists who call themselves Til’at Reehitkum (You Stink) — a reference to the pervasive garbage smell that wafts not just from the trash-strewn streets but also, protesters contend, from the rotting entrails of the central government. They ended the Sunday protest when a small group of troublemakers not associated with You Stink taunted and attacked the police, setting off several hours of street fighting that resulted in dozens of people injured and one dead youth. You Stink replaced the planned Monday evening demonstration with a less dramatic march through downtown Beirut as it awaits the government’s response and makes arrangements to prevent future troublemakers from derailing the nonviolent protests."

Prosecutors said the 13-year-old confessed lying about the rape claim three days later when experts questioned her. She reportedly made it up to hide an incident at school from her parents.

Her allegations came less than two weeks after nearly 100 women in Cologne, Germany, reported mass sexual assaults by gangs of Middle Eastern men during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Stories of the Cologne assaults garnered international attention and aggravated German paranoia against refugees. It also triggered protests by Russian-German community and far-right groups.

Unsurprisingly, the teen’s retraction of her rape allegation received less media attention than the initial story. The construction of the refugee as rapist adds crime to an otherwise abstract dislike of the foreign “other.” It also whets a sense of German nationhood, its urgency predicated on protecting white German women from encroaching hordes of brown men. Taken together, the exclusion of foreigners, once a worrisome iteration of burgeoning racism, is now repackaged as a feminist necessity.

Anti-immigration sentiments in Germany had been rising long before the New Year’s Eve incidents. The far-right Patriotic Europeans Against Islamization of the Occident (PEGIDA) is one of the staunchest opponents to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door policy toward refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq. The Dresden-based group began holding rallies across Germany in late 2014.

As with other right-wing groups across Europe, PEGIDA wants to restrict immigration and impose a duty on those already in Germany. PEGIDA’s use of the quaint German term Abenland, meaning occident, underscores its imagined war against the orient represented by the influx of refugees and migrants arriving in Germany. Its easy binaries of a gender equal West at war with inherently misogynistic Muslims — the latest iteration of the hackneyed clash of civilizations rhetoric — is attractive to white middle-class Germans who already see foreigners as a threat to their national identity.

A week before the Cologne incident, PEGIDA held a massive rally in Dresden with 22,000 participants demanding stricter immigration laws. “I say to all who go to such demonstrations: Don’t follow those who call for your participation,” Merkel said in her New Year’s Eve address exhorting Germans to reject PEGIDA, “because all too often there is prejudice, cold, yes, even hatred in their hearts.” It was Merkel’s last stand in favor of welcoming Syrian and Iraqi refugees fleeing the bestiality and persecution of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant."

But once the dust settles in Paris, right-wing parties will emerge stronger than ever. From the National Front’s Marine Le Pen, whose often racist and xenophobic commentary seems misplaced in a country that criminalizes hate speech, to former President Nicolas Sarkozy, last Friday’s attacks provide ammunition to France’s conservative voices — and just a month before regional elections.

Even before the massacre, the French right was poised for success ahead of the December vote, and President François Hollande’s approval ratings were lower than ever. Over the last several days, right-wing politicians have lambasted the Socialist government’s counterterrorism policies and argued that its foreign policy is crippling French security. On Saturday, protesters affiliated with the National Front stormed a solidarity march in Lille, while clashes broke out at an extreme-right protest in Brittany.

“France and French people are no longer safe,” said Le Pen following the attack. Her proposed solutions: Seal borders, close mosques, deport radical imams and expel foreigners who “preach hatred” and illegal immigrants who “have nothing to do here.” As she took to Twitter and the airwaves to announce her post-attack platform, Le Pen — in a not-so-subtle campaign move — declared that the National Front would suspend its campaign as France mourned.

Sarkozy’s reaction has been equally harsh. The former French president and leader of the center-right Republican party called for the 11,500 residents identified in the “S Files” — already on the intelligence services’ radar — to be placed under surveillance with an electronic bracelet. A “center for deradicalization” should be created to house those “tempted by radicalism,” he added, and, echoing Le Pen, “radical” imams should be expelled aggressively. He also clarified how he might identify these extremists: For Sarko, anyone who “consults a jihadist site” is a potential terrorist. In other words: be afraid, journalists and researchers.

These views are not new. “Laïcité,” or the French secular model, lends itself to right-wing tactics that aim to divide. The right has long sought to demonize French Muslims and ensure that they remain on the sidelines of the Republic. The attacks have only energized their efforts.

Accordingly, France has banned the full veil in public places. Recently, the mayor of Chalon-sur-Saône, who is a member of Sarkozy’s party, banned pork-free options in school lunches, arguing that doing otherwise would violate France’s secular values. In reality, it forces Muslim and Jewish schoolchildren to defy their own convictions or go hungry while attending a state institution in the land of liberté, égalité, fraternité. Sarkozy endorsed the ban, suggesting that those opposed should send their children to private school instead."

Nein was evidently addressing a U.S. audience, because Germans need no introduction to the TTIP. Opposition to the free trade deal was strong enough to draw an estimated 250,000 protesters into the streets of Berlin on Oct. 10. Meanwhile, Germany’s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, published a full-page letter in several major newspapers on the day of the protest to urge against “scaremongering.”

Lately, public attention in the U.S. has been more focused on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal between the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. It has received considerable American media attention and opposition from labor advocates, environmentalists, digital privacy groups and most Democrats (including an eleventh-hour U-turn of dissent from Hillary Clinton). Their objections are justified: The treaty is a gift to big corporations and a blow to many environmental and worker protections. The same goes for the TTIP; in fact, that deal was drawn up with the same intent: to open up markets, purportedly promote jobs and growth and integrate U.S. and EU markets.

Fears in Europe about the TTIP mirror Americans’ anxieties about the TPP. Both deals promote market liberalization over consumer, worker and environmental protections. And negotiations for both were conducted largely in secret. While there have been protests in London, the U.S. and in a number of other Pacific Rim nations, the TPP has not incited the quarter-million-strong march seen in Berlin. The idea that tens of thousands of people would take to the streets against economic globalization seemed consigned to a bygone protest era at the close of the last century — think Seattle’s mobilizations against the World Trade Organization in 1999. As political reporter Felix Werdermann wrote in Der Freitag, a German weekly, “Two years ago, no one would have believed that we would see a large citizens’ movement against the TTIP.” Berlin hasn’t hosted a demonstration this big since Germany’s largest day of anti–Iraq War protests in 2003.

Why Berlin? Freer trade is a more frightening prospect for Europeans than Americans. Regulations on this side of the Atlantic are already more lax, unions have been long defanged, and welfare services are already sparse. The TTIP aims to open Europe’s public health, education and water services to U.S. businesses to encourage competition and transnational trade. Opponents warn that the deal could open up public services, such as Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), to irreversible privatization; unless protections are explicitly put in place, the TTIP would allow multinational health care corporations to sue national governments if government policies (such as the crucial preservation of public health services) mean the companies lose money when doing business with that country.

Nebulous assurances that jobs, public services and regulations will be protected have been met with understandable skepticism from environmentalists, unions and politicians from the Green and Linke parties, among others. With outstanding fears that the deal may threaten national sovereignty over public services like the NHS, it makes sense that European citizens are pushing back against the deal as it approaches its final negotiation stages."

Officer Jason Van Dyke, who has a long history of abusive behavior, is now the first on-duty Chicago police officer in decades to face first-degree murder charges. He was released from jail on Monday after posting 10 percent of his $1.5 million bail.

But until recently, the case appeared destined for the same procedural quagmire that obscures countless incidents of police violence across the country. It underscores the urgent need for radical reform of how evidence of police violence is stored and made public.

The murder of McDonald, 17, seemed to follow an all-too-familiar storyline: First, authorities placate the public by announcing a supposedly fair and thorough investigation into police shootings while maintaining the killing was justified. A year or so later, investigators release a vague and self-serving statement reaffirming the police’s original story. The details of the incident have long been forgotten. No charges are filed, a family mourns, and the media move on to the next story.

McDonald’s story ended differently only because reporter Brandon Smith sued the city for the release of dashcam videos from the officers’ squad cars, after police-reform activist Jamie Kalven received a tip from a whistleblower. After more than a year of delay, the video was made available online for only an hour on Nov. 24, suspiciously because of what city officials claimed was limited bandwidth. It shows that McDonald was shot 16 times less than 30 seconds after Van Dyke arrived on the scene. The shots began as the teen sauntered away from police cars, contradicting the initial claim that McDonald was shot only once and that he lunged at officers with a knife. Thirteen of the shots were fired after McDonald fell to the ground.

It was a stunning turn of events, but more shocking was how the Chicago police and city government desperately tried to cover it up. Within a few hours of the shooting, officers marched into a nearby Burger King, accessed the restaurant’s security system and deleted 86 minutes of video from an exterior security camera that captured the incident. And at the city’s request, the dashboard video from the officers’ cars was barred from release as a condition of a $5 million settlement with McDonald’s family.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has tried to deflect attention, calling the shooting “hideous” and saying “one individual needs to be held accountable.” On Tuesday police chief Garry McCarthy stepped down after the mayor called for his resignation. But it’s clear that many others are culpable, including Emanuel and other city officials who conspired with the police from the beginning to deny the justice they now celebrate being served. As Smith noted this week, the city has yet to release all the dashcam videos and emails related to the incident.

“From everything we’ve learned, compulsively at every level, from the cops on the scene to the highest levels of government, they responded by circling the wagons and by fabricating a narrative that they knew was completely false,” Kalven told The Chicago Reporter last week, calling for changes to “the underlying conditions that allow abuse and shield abuse.”"

But I’m subjecting you to mine because Planned Parenthood, which provides women across the country with high-quality, low-cost care, is at risk of being defunded. The fact is, my vulva is in danger of fusing shut. I didn’t know this until two months ago, when Planned Parenthood diagnosed my condition after my gynecologists couldn’t, and it helped me when my health insurance wouldn’t. I’ve had a condition with embarrassing but unremarkable symptoms for a couple of decades now: intense itching in the vulva during flare-ups and excruciating pain whenever anything is inserted. It sometimes feels OK, but when it’s bad, it’s really bad. The pain started early. When I was 13, I went to the emergency room with intense pain in the lower right abdomen. The doctor couldn’t tell whether it was an ovarian cyst or appendicitis, so he called in a couple of colleagues. The result was that I — a physically small 13-year-old — was subjected to three pelvic exams. Most ovarian cyst ruptures aren’t dangerous, but the pain is severe. You double over and break out in a cold sweat. What I remember from that long-ago ER visit isn’t the pain from the cyst, though; it’s the indescribable agony of those pelvic exams. No one batted an eye at my vaginal pain at that particular moment. Given the risk of appendicitis, there were more important fish to fry. But the incident shaped my expectations. When I started going to a gynecologist, I assumed that that pain level on insertion of a speculum or other medical device was normal. My gynecologists likely assumed that I was prone to dramatics or hypochondria when I gasped and gritted my teeth and apologized as a tear or two leaked out of the corner of an eye when they inserted a tiny speculum. Some of them thought I was lying when I said I hadn’t had sex. But I couldn’t imagine having sex; tampons were barely tolerable. The thought of giving birth made me collapse in a swooning salute to my gender. The condition lasted years. I came to call it the Thing. Doctors reassured me that everything was fine. They diagnosed yeast infections or chalked it up to allergies or changed my birth control or ordered herpes tests that kept coming back negative. Boyfriends, of course, didn’t know what to do. So I got on with it, convinced I was defective, crazy or both. Sex, when it finally happened, felt like being impaled. My vulva felt as if it were covered in carpet burns. I pretended everything was great, but it was agony — and, given the contrast with my partner’s pleasure, lonely too. “What kind of Darwinian failure am I?” I mused, mired in the shameful solitude of an animal trying to mask its defect.

I now have Planned Parenthood to thank for the discovery that my vulva is in danger of losing its architecture.

Things got worse with stress. Right before my wedding nine years ago, the area was so horrifically angry — white bumps, ulcerations, fissures — that I ended up consulting a doctor the day before the ceremony. He suggested herpes and sent me on my way. I suspected a misdiagnosis, as usual. Still, I wondered. Had I gotten herpes since my last test? Had my fiancé cheated on me? (He hadn’t.) I got married with my nethers in agony. The marriage did not last, for many reasons, including my sexual dysfunction. Loneliness of the sexual kind only seems to expand. Some years later, a kind family friend who happened to be an OB/GYN alerted me to the possibility that I might have vestibulitis. Female genital pain, like female sexual dysfunction, is woefully underresearched. The literature on vestibulitis was limited, but he knew of it. One test consisted of holding a wet cotton swab up to the vestibule of the vagina and touching it very gently to see if hurt. It did. The doctor did all he could. I was given dilators and topical analgesics. (Numbness before sex was the best outcome I could hope for.) It all helped a little. Sometimes sex felt almost normal — even good. But not always. Fast-forward a decade: I was traveling, and the Thing flared up. I couldn’t walk without intense discomfort. I couldn’t sleep. Underwear was out of the question. I had recently gotten an activity tracker, and my average of 11,000 steps a day went down to 1,300. Worst of all, my health insurance didn’t cover where I was. There would be a $7,500 deductible for out-of-network visits unless it was an emergency — and female pain is seldom considered an emergency. After five days it showed no sign of improvement, so I started looking for alternatives and came up with Planned Parenthood. I had never considered Planned Parenthood before, and I didn’t want to then. The last thing I needed en route to yet another doctor was a horde of protesters brandishing photographs of aborted fetuses and screaming at me. But I gathered my wits and called. I was seen the same day. The facility was clean and welcoming. The receptionist gave me an estimate and checked in with me at every stage to tell me how much everything would cost. My nurse practitioner took her time. She listened to my concerns and symptoms with a level of attention I had never received before. She examined me and called in a colleague to consult on my case. They conferred, and she explained what she thought was going on: a rare condition called lichen sclerosus, in which the skin thins and starts to form white plaques, papules, ulcerations and fissures. She urged that I get a biopsy and helped me get in touch with a hospital that could perform it. I got the biopsy. Her diagnosis was correct. I now have Planned Parenthood to thank for the discovery that my vulva is in danger of losing its architecture. If lichen sclerosus — a mutilating disease of mysterious origin — goes untreated, according to Susanna Fistarol and Peter Itin in a paper published in The American Journal of Clinical Dermatology, the “labia minora may become reabsorbed and fused and the clitoris entrapped under scar tissue. The vaginal introitus may become stenotic and narrowed.” The skin thins in some places and thickens in others; there’s a small chance of developing squamous cell carcinoma, a kind of cancer. The condition is incurable and progressive unless you aggressively manage the symptoms. At the moment, standard treatment is an ultrapotent topical steroid.

We ought, as a society, to take stock of how our Puritan habits make it easy for us to blindly accept the punitive logic of Eve’s curse."

This is good news for residents of those states, but there’s a major potential drawback: It’s not clear whether insurance companies, which are obligated to cover prescription birth control under the Affordable Care Act, will cover the over-the-counter variety as well.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray wants birth control to be available over the counter and covered by insurance whether or not it’s prescribed by a doctor. And Senate Republicans have proposed a bill that would give drug manufacturers more of an incentive to lobby the Food and Drug Administration to make birth control available over the counter.

If that sounds suspiciously generous and progressive for Senate Republicans, it’s because it is. They’re suddenly eager to get birth control approved for over-the-counter use because they want to protect their insurance company donor pals from having to pay for it. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, one of the Republican bill’s sponsors, has collected $470,066 from the insurance industry over five years in office; her co-sponsor, Sen. Cory Gardner, took $240,440 in just one year. Contrast this with Murray, who, in over 20 years in office, has accepted considerably less insurance industry money than Ayotte. Making birth control available over the counter without requiring insurers to cover it would certainly help insurance companies, but it won’t help women who can’t afford to pay for it out of pocket.

Another concern is that women may be less likely to make routine visits to their gynecologists if they can get birth control at their local drugstores. Many women do not need to be prodded into seeking routine medical care, but others are already resistant to it for a variety of reasons, including overwork, poverty, fear of deportation and an understandable reluctance to spend anywhere from two hours to two days traveling to the office of an overscheduled doctor who keeps you waiting forever only to hustle you out in 20 minutes. No woman I know looks forward to stirrups, speculums and sitting around in a paper gown that opens in the front. Even with insurance, doctor’s visits aren’t exactly fun. For most women, there are very few cheap, convenient alternatives other than Planned Parenthood, which, now that it’s under siege from Republicans and gun-wielding maniacs, is more crucial than ever. All of which explains why making access to birth control contingent on getting a Pap smear is nonsensical and unduly burdensome for women.

It makes sense to require a prescription for highly addictive substances and drugs that carry serious medical risks. But very little medical evidence suggests that modern birth control is dangerous. Thanks to lower doses of hormones, birth control is safer today than in the early days of the pill, and studies show that women are capable of properly evaluating the risks without a doctor’s help."

The decision capped a year of mounting frustration and outrage over the disproportionate use of lethal force by police officers against black people.

Nearly every aspect of the case is deeply troubling. The police dispatcher, who sent officers to the recreation center where Rice was fatally shot, failed to inform them that the 911 caller noted he was “probably a juvenile” with a “probably fake” gun. Rice was alone in a park, with no one in imminent danger. Yet the officers shot him within two seconds of arriving at the scene. He was not given any aid for nearly four minutes, and officers prevented Rice’s distraught 14-year old sister from comforting him, pinning and handcuffing her.

Rice’s death is not the sad outcome of a “perfect storm” of tragic mistakes as District Attorney Tim McGinty characterized it, nor is it Rice’s fault or that of his community. His untimely death reflects the brutal reality of racism and impunity that permeates policing, evincing a shocking indifference to the lives of Cleveland’s black residents.

McGinty, who recommended no indictments in this case, has been long criticized by the Rice family and activists for dragging the case out, releasing exculpatory information and sabotaging the process to ensure that the officers were exonerated. In November he accused members of the Rice family, who are pursuing a civil suit, of having “economic motives” for seeking justice for their dead son.

The numbers on police violence in Cleveland and nationwide should disturb. Since 2012, Cleveland police have killed 10 people. All were black, and seven were unarmed. Nationwide, 1,134 people were killed by law enforcement officers in 2015. They were disproportionately black. From 2010 to 2012, black teens — ages 15 to 19 — were 21 times as likely to be killed by police as their white counterparts.

By contrast, despite the rhetoric about a war on police, 2015 was the second-least-deadly year for police officers in decades. Assaults are declining as well. The effect of the dangerously false narrative is pernicious, contributing to a siege mentality among officers that influences their perceptions and reactions, at times to lethal effect. Crime rates are dropping as well, despite public perceptions to the contrary.

Police accountability is key to ending unjustified killings but remains elusive. Prosecutors who work closely with police departments have repeatedly demonstrated their reluctance to hold officers to account. Many district attorneys are elected, giving them perverse incentives for overcharging defendants and undercharging officers. And as with McGinty, many rely on the secret grand jury system to bring charges, allowing them to obscure their strategic presentation of evidence, which can skew the result in favor of the officers.

The result is impunity. Since 2005, only 54 officers have been charged in the thousands of fatal shootings. And the vast majority of those officers were exonerated or acquitted. Civil suits offer little solace. Even when plaintiffs prevail, the cost is typically borne by taxpayers, not the officers involved or departmental coffers."

Korea Sanctions",[],"[u'korea', u'north', u'sanctions', u'nuclear', u'koreas', u'n', u'united', u'china', u'council', u'test', u'draft', u'security', u'resolution']","The United States and China have reached agreement on a U.N. resolution that would impose tougher sanctions on North Korea as punishment for its latest and rocket launch, U.N. diplomats said Wednesday.

One Security Council diplomat called the draft resolution ""significantly substantive"" and expressed hope that it will be adopted in the coming days. Another said the draft had been circulated on Wednesday to the three other permanent council members — Russia, Britain and France.

The Security Council is scheduled to hold closed consultations Thursday afternoon on compliance with the North Korean sanctions resolutions, and the U.S.-China draft could be discussed then with the 10 non-permanent council members.

Both diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because all discussions on the proposed resolution have been private.

China and the United States have had different views on how strong the response should be to North Korea since Pyongyang's nuclear test last month with Washington urging harsh punitive measures and Beijing emphasizing dialogue and milder U.N. steps that are confined to non-proliferation.

The draft resolution is expected to call for the blacklisting of a number of individuals and entities, diplomats said. They were reluctant to provide further details.

North Korea's Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry and its National Aerospace Development Agency (NADA), the body responsible for February's rocket launch, will be amongst the sanctioned entities, South Korea's Yonhap news reported.

The secretive General Reconnaissance Bureau, already sanctioned by the United States for its suspected role in the 2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures, was also included in the blacklist, Yonhap said.

News of the draft follows a flurry of activity in Washington, including meetings between China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday, and with National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Wednesday afternoon.

National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said Rice and Wang agreed ""on the importance of a strong and united international response to North Korea's provocations, including through a U.N. Security Council resolution that goes beyond previous resolutions.""

""They agreed that they will not accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state,"" Price said.

Earlier on Wednesday, Kerry told a Congressional hearing: ""We're on the brink of achieving a strong United Nations Security Council resolution.""

North Korea started off the new year with what it claims was its first hydrogen bomb test on Jan. 6 and followed that up with the launch of a satellite on a rocket on Feb. 7 that was condemned by much of the world as a test of banned missile technology.

Over the past 10 years, North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests and launched six long-range missiles — all in violation of Security Council resolutions.

South Korea's U.N. Ambassador Oh Joon has urged the Security Council to adopt ""extraordinary"" measures to make clear to the North ""that it will no longer tolerate its nuclear weapons development.""

The Carousel of Progress is an animatronic history of consumer technology, as told by an unaging American family expressing starry-eyed wonder at the ever-increasing conveniences available to them — from modern plumbing and electricity to television, washing machines and home automation.

The show has undergone several updates since its debut, but its techno-utopian message remains clear: No matter the era, the entirely white robot family sings, there’s always a “Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow” promising ever greater convenience and contentment — thanks, of course, to General Electric, the Carousel of Progress’ original sponsor. (The company briefly forced the creation of a much less catchy theme song for the show called “Now Is the Time” because it was worried Americans would gaze off into tomorrow instead of buying appliances today.)

Disney’s consumer fantasy proved alive and well at last week’s Consumer Electronics Show, an overwrought annual spectacle where tech executives appear on unnecessarily large stages to unveil often unnecessary products that nobody asked for. This year, companies were more determined than ever to pitch the so-called Internet of Things, the questionable (and often perilous) trend of adding Internet connectivity to every mundane household item imaginable. It’s a stupidly simple racket: Just take anything that exists (shoelaces, refrigerators, toothbrushes, toasters) put a computer chip or camera in it, connect it to the Internet and — voila! Who wants boring old things when you can have smart things?

The appropriately named Twitter account Internet of Shit highlights some of the most cringeworthy examples from the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. Sick of having to walk over to your refrigerator and open it? Smart refrigerators now have cameras that let you see inside using your smartphone. Tired of tying your own shoelaces? Try on a pair of smart shoes that loosen and tighten themselves with the touch of an app. If you’re trying to lose weight, why manually count the notches on your belt when you can wear a Samsung smart belt that tracks the size of your waistline? The Internet of Things isn’t just for humans anymore either: Now your pets can wear their own fitness trackers and even call you at work through paw-activated two-way video monitors.

With their overhyped sales pitches, companies seem convinced that Internet-connected everything is the next chapter in the triumphant story told by Disney’s Carousel of Progress. The sad truth is the Internet of Things has thus far been an endless parade of novelty junk appealing to first world laziness and privileged overindulgence. Even the more promising smart home devices, such as Google’s Nest thermostat, differ from their disconnected counterparts mainly in their ability to be accessed with a smartphone, making them just another thing to be checked on after our social media feeds and email inboxes.

So if these products aren’t poised to improve our lives in any major or meaningful way, why are companies so intent on selling them?

There are two answers: data and control."

Apparently, it was funnier when “The Daily Show” did it. A sophomorically titled 2011 segment, Lactate Intolerance, lampoons the Fox News anchor’s evolving views on parental leave, joking that the “mama grizzly’s” criticism of government benefits did not apply to laws requiring employers to give new moms 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave, from which she personally benefited.

To drive home this point, Jon Stewart juxtaposed clips of Kelly defending her leave as “not a racket” against clips of her decrying government mandated benefits as a first step toward socialism.

While the satire would have been a success without reminding us all that Kelly has breasts, her lactating lady bits provoke uncomfortable giggles — which, it seems, is all the show needs to consider them fair game.

In the grand tradition of stand-up comedy, “The Daily Show,” along with its late-night talk show counterparts, tends to treat womanhood as though it is worthy of ridicule in and of itself. Misogynist jibes take precedence over satire focused on the competence, moral behavior or professional performance of any individual woman they seek to criticize. As Stewart vacates the host’s chair to comic Trevor Noah (and not the exceedingly funny longtime “Daily Show” staffer Samantha Bee), it is time to take stock of such humor.

For instance, in the regular segment formerly known as Headlines, the show’s writers regularly roast powerful men. Sen. Mitch McConnell is as slow as a turtle, Trump is a self-unaware cretin with orangutan hair, Bill O’Reilly is a hypocrite, and Bill de Blasio eats pizza with a fork and knife. The segment rarely subjects men to ridicule for being born male, unless Trump’s desperate attempt to camouflage male-pattern baldness counts. Women, on the other hand, are belittled for being women. To name just a few examples, Stewart and his mostly male writers cast Democratic hero Valerie Plame Wilson as a “fuckable blonde,” condemned Hillary Clinton as a boner killer, joked about first lady Laura Bush being covered in horse semen and suggested how Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice may have earned the Secret Service nickname Ping-Pong Ball.

To be fair, “The Daily Show” sometimes invokes bigoted tropes to skewer harmful stereotypes. In Hasan Minhaj’s Muslim Makeover clip, which aired in June, women are encouraged to ditch their hijabs for American flag string bikinis to get what they want from an American airline. The satirical target here is the sexist West, not women or Muslims. But there is not always a clear reason for, say, drowning accomplished women in horse semen other than to degrade them just for being women and to get laughs.

The lazy, sexist jibes stand in sharp contrast to Stewart’s respectful treatment of his female guests. He champions policies in favor of women’s rights and eviscerates misogyny in other media outlets. He was one of the only critics to ridicule media gawkers for evaluating Caitlin Jenner’s ability to conform to the feminine ideal, noting that the only woman over 65 to ever appear on Vanity Fair’s cover had a penis. All of correspondent Jessica Williams’ appearances are feminist masterpieces, including a takedown of men who catcall."

Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta pushed back saying, gay rights are a “non-issue” and not a priority for his country. The exchange was a win-win for both leaders: Kenyan politicians praised Kenyatta for remaining “firm but respectful” in defending the country’s prohibition of homosexuality. Obama received accolades from the western media and human rights activists for raising LGBT rights issues.

Unfortunately, the exchange was representative of much of Obama’s Africa policy, which builds upon decades of missed opportunities and hypocritical support for states that violate human rights. Obama’s ambivalence on democratic principles continued during his stopover in Ethiopia, whose government he referred to twice as “democratically elected.” (Ethiopia’s ruling party won all 547 seats in parliament during national elections in May.)

Beyond passing references to human rights concerns, Obama missed a valuable opportunity to apply significant pressure on his hosts and telegraph support for civil society groups, which Washington champions in unfriendly countries such as Russia and Venezuela. Instead, by skirting serious human rights abuses and speaking in platitudes, Obama’s trip highlighted the Unites States’ longstanding hypocrisy and disregard for its democratic ideals. The United States’ misguided Africa policy, which prioritizes security over partnership with the African people, is counterproductive and will not help achieve lasting stability in the continent.

Furthermore, Obama’s cherry picking of low-risk human rights issues undermines U.S. strategic objectives on the continent by lending further credibility to countries such as China, which traditionally avoid the sort of political conditionalities that the U.S. frequently pays lip service to. In his final speech inside Kenya’s Kasarani Stadium, Obama did not mention the detention of 4,000 Somalis and Kenyan Muslims in Operation Usalama at that very stadium following a spate of grenade and gun attacks in Nairobi and Mombasa in April 2014. The detainees lived in squalid conditions without adequate food and water. Obama also failed to address the ongoing harassment of civil society groups and police reform advocates. In April, the Kenyan police designated two nonprofits — the Muslims for Human Rights and Haki Africa — as “terrorist organizations,” prompting their removal from Kenya’s NGO registry.

Similarly, in Ethiopia, Obama did not press the government on its blatant human rights abuses, much of which was documented by the State Department’s most recent annual country report. The report identified restrictions on the freedom of expression and association as “the most significant human rights problems,” and acknowledged “alleged arbitrary killings; alleged torture, beating, abuse, and mistreatment of detainees by security forces; reports of harsh and at times life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention.”

“Cozying up to nasty regimes or staying silent in the face of abuses hasn’t worked in the past,” David Kampf opined in The New York Times recently. “It just kicks the problems down the road and often creates new ones. The next generation of citizens, and leaders who defend democracy and protect rights, are the ones to establish connections with.” He is right. Obama’s latest trip to Africa highlighted Washington’s allegiance to ‘stable’ but undemocratic partners in the name of security. This strategic priority undermines the work of already beleaguered civil society actors who are demanding democratic reform as a way to stump out corruption and forestall radicalization."

Flagged by correctional officers as unruly or dangerous, troublemakers would be locked up in this network of solitary confinement cells with virtually no human contact 23 hours a day, left to spiral into despair and psychological devastation. Now the state government is beginning to dismantle this infamous testament to the American way of torture.

Under a groundbreaking settlement recently reached between New York state and the New York Civil Liberties Union, correctional authorities say they will “comprehensively overhaul solitary confinement” across the state’s prison system. The advocacy groups and solitary confinement survivors who brought a legal challenge hope that ending the worst forms of punitive isolation will help establish essential human rights standards in one of the country’s largest prison systems.

The five-year reform plan directs the state to release people incrementally through a step-down approach. Authorities will grant automatic early release on the basis of good behavior, end the use of starvation punishment through revolting rations of Nutraloaf and expand access to phone communications and recreational opportunities. The state will sharply limit the infractions that could land someone in extreme isolation. Placements will now be limited to less than three months, except in cases involving severe assault or attempted escape, and under one month for first-time nonviolent offenders. But even after leaving the box, the solitary confinement population — currently about 4,000 individuals statewide — will be far from free and will likely always be haunted by the experience.

The immediate beneficiaries are about 1,100 inmates who will be shifted out of solitary and into tailored rehabilitative services — including behavioral therapy, drug treatment and special programming for youths. The release plans for this cohort illustrate how the box has been twisted into a repository for people the system is not equipped to handle.

Thirty-nine people in the box will transition into rehabilitative services, without which they would “otherwise be released directly from solitary to the streets,” according to the settlement. While formerly incarcerated people generally face steep social and economic barriers after release, survivors of solitary may need even more extensive therapy and social supports to help them cope with life in the community, and there’s no guarantee of a full recovery. What is certain is that the time they have lost to the box is irrevocable. The mental torture of solitary has created tremendous long-term social costs for people who might otherwise be able to reintegrate more readily into their communities and the labor force after release.

Also exiting the box are 64 people with developmental disabilities. They are a segment of the prison population for whom solitary is often administered as a form of therapy rather than outright punishment — isolating people ostensibly to protect them from harming themselves or others. Yet this lethal conflation of security and suppression suggests that punitive segregation (sometimes euphemistically called restricted housing) has become a tool for managing disorder. While isolating mentally unstable or vulnerable people may quiet a restive cellblock, it inevitably deprives them of critical therapy and social care to which they would normally be entitled, had they wound up in an asylum instead of a cell."

The idea that there was a drafting error or a problem with the wording of the statute did not emerge until well after most of the 16 states already decided to establish an exchange. The plaintiff’s version of history did not seem consistent with how the states made their decisions. This was all the more surprising given that the lower courts were still considering Halbig v. Burwell, another lawsuit over the legality of the subsidies in states using the federal exchange.

This was a major blow for the Obama administration, especially as it struggled to launch the website, HealthCare.gov, through which people in those states would purchase coverage. But this setback was only temporary. The website got better, and enrollment targets were reached. In fact, many states that chose to establish an exchange have struggled with complicated technology and financing challenges. Many leaders now wonder why they worked so hard to establish an exchange and whether it made sense for each state to reinvent the wheel. A ruling against the government in King v. Burwell would have forced those 34 states to figure out a way to establish an exchange at the precise moment that some of the other 16 are trying to find a way to scale back.

First, it is surprising that so many states rejected the opportunity to establish a health insurance exchange. The conventional wisdom when the law was enacted in March 2010 was that the promise of federal money and the threat of a federal takeover were enough to convince virtually every state to retain control. The 2010 elections dramatically altered the composition of state governments and empowered tea party voices advocating for complete opposition. The traditionally powerful interest groups in most states strongly supported an exchange, including insurers, hospitals, providers and consumer advocates. Even so, opposition was strong enough that 34 states ultimately defaulted to the federal exchange.

The outcome is not entirely surprising, since it is consistent with what the writers of the ACA intended (according to this article and this amicus brief filed by health policy scholars). Even so, there are at five surprising aspects of this case that we will be talking about for a long time.

The Supreme Court’s ruling in King v. Burwell is a major victory for President Barack Obama and other supporters of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The decision means that more than 6.4 million people who were using tax credits to purchase health insurance may continue to receive them. Without this assistance, millions would have lost coverage, and premiums for everyone else in the federal exchange would have skyrocketed.

It has been only a little more than five years since the ACA was signed into law, yet it has already survived a presidential election, more than 50 congressional repeal votes and now two Supreme Court challenges.

Third, that the court took the case means there were at least four justices willing to rule against the government, since that is the minimum number needed to vote to hear a case. It is therefore surprising that the final vote was 6-3, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy voting in the majority. Does this suggest that someone had a change of heart since agreeing to hear the case?

The fourth surprise is how the decision was reached. The likely path to victory for the government seemed to be a ruling consistent with the lower courts following the so-called Chevron rule (named after a decision in 1984): If a statute is deemed ambiguous and if the executive branch’s interpretation is considered reasonable, then the courts are supposed to defer to the administration.

Instead, Roberts wrote for the majority in King v. Burwell that Chevron “is not the appropriate framework” and that “it is instead the court’s task to determine the correct reading” of the parts of the law in question. He went on to explain that “Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the act in the way that is consistent with the former and avoids the latter.” This is more than a trivial bit of legalese. The implication is that there is very little, short of congressional repeal, any of the Republicans aspiring to be president can do to remove the subsidies after taking office.

Finally, Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent is surprisingly aggressive, even for him. He sarcastically writes — with a clear tone of bitterness — that the court has rewritten the law enough that it should now be known as “SCOTUScare,” (after the acronym for the Supreme Court of the United States). He refers to part of Roberts’ opinion as “pure applesauce.” Elsewhere he calls part of the majority opinion “absurd” and “interpretive jiggery-pokery.” By the time he wrote this dissent he likely knew he was also on the losing side of Friday's Obergefell v. Hodges decision recognizing same-sex marriage rights. Beyond humorously introducing new words to the health reform lexicon, Scalia’s writings might suggest discontent with the direction of the Court and his place on it.

Regardless of how we got to this point and the surprises along the way, this is a landmark moment for health reform. It has been only a little more than five years since the ACA was signed into law, yet it has already survived a presidential election, more than 50 congressional repeal votes and now two Supreme Court challenges. Repealing the law appears less and less realistic as time goes on. The longer people receive coverage and benefit from greater access to health care, the more difficult it will be to take away their insurance. Hopefully, there are not many more surprises around the corner, and we can focus on making the law work better."

Every five years, the government reviews these recommendations and releases new advice to eaters. The implications are huge: The guidelines direct billions of dollars in government food and nutrition programs, from school food to funding for the Women, Infants and Children program. What’s more, they inform how millions of Americans decide what is healthy for themselves and their families — influencing billions of dollars in food purchases.

Last year the government’s nonpartisan Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee made some unprecedented recommendations. Among other things, it suggested it was time to break from past guidelines and make clear that Americans should reduce consumption of red and processed meats and added sugars, especially sugar-sweetened beverages.

The committee also argued that the guidelines should take sustainability into account. Healthy eating, after all, means ensuring that we can feed ourselves and our children healthy food for decades to come. To that end, the committee wrote that “a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet.”

Unfortunately, the final guidelines, released last week, backpedaled on many of these common-sense recommendations. The reason is simple: The food industry — especially meat and beverage companies and trade groups — lobbied heavily against the committee’s recommendations. According to Bloomberg, four-fifths of the 60 groups that lobbied on the guidelines represented food corporations, industry groups or farmers. While Barack Obama’s administration presented the final guidelines as the best distillation of nutrition science, the reality is that they have been distorted by industry influence.

For instance, while the recommendation to reduce added sugars stuck, the emphasis on soda — one of the main sources of such sugars — was downplayed. Dr. Lawrence Gostin, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center on Public Health Law, said on Democracy Now that the biggest beverage companies “put a lot of pressure” on government officials to change the language.

The recommendation to reduce meat consumption was also distorted. The final guidelines suggested limiting such consumption only for teenage boys and men, and even this recommendation was buried in the final report. Noticeably absent from the guidelines was a strong recommendation for reducing red and processed meats, even though the science is clear about their links to serious illness.

As my colleague Kari Hamerschlag from Friends of the Earth said in a statement, “Despite clear evidence that high red meat consumption is linked to cancer and threatens future food security because of its huge resource demands, the 2015 guidelines failed to make a specific portion size recommendation for red meat,” as in the 2010 version. While the WHO recommends significantly limiting intake of processed meats because of the associated increased cancer risk, the guidelines are fuzzy on this message. In fact, buried in the guidelines is the suggestion that eating processed meat is fine as long as it is in quantities that fall below fat and salt limits. Nowhere is there a reference to the WHO’s findings linking processed meat consumption and certain cancers."

It features the outline of a small vehicle and reads, “The 405 is a joyride … in a driverless car.”

The 405 is the main freeway serving the west side of Los Angeles County, and along with earthquakes, humidity and natural aging, it’s the stuff of Angelenos’ nightmares. The federal government has cited the highway, with its average daily traffic of 374,000 vehicles, as the nation’s single busiest roadway. L.A. sunk five years and more than $1 billion into a project to widen its right-of-way through a congested mountain pass. (Officials called the temporary closure of the roadway “Carmageddon.”) The city has spent several times that amount expanding its mass transit system, with the promise that light rail and bus-only lanes would alleviate some of the region’s famous traffic jams. If anything, the traffic has gotten worse.

As for driverless cars, they’re likely to be a fixture of our roads by the end of this decade. Aided by a scanning technology called “lidar,” Google started testing vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, Tesla’s Autopilot program is now in beta and conventional carmakers such as Nissan and Ford aren’t far behind. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers estimates that by 2040, up to 75 percent of cars on the road will be autonomous. Could this be the solution to L.A.’s notorious traffic?

Probably not. Since I moved here three months ago to study urban planning, I’ve been engaged in the ultimate class project: living in L.A. without a car. Public transit junkies often imagine that with the right combination of incentives and policies, any city can be made into Manhattan. All around the L.A. area, heroic efforts are being made to reduce auto dependence and improve people’s ability to get around by foot, bike and public transit. But the wide streets, ample parking and huge tracts of single-family houses don’t lie: L.A.’s urban form is almost entirely built to move automobile traffic as quickly as possible.

The urban planner Fred Kent famously says, “If you plan cities for cars and traffic, you get cars and traffic. If you plan for people and places, you get people and places.” Driverless cars are an exciting development, but they are still cars. They’re very much in their infancy, and much of the reporting on them has centered on technology and design. In a recent article in The New York Times Magazine, “The Dream Life of Driverless Cars,” two passengers gaze upon London from the computer’s-eye view of a Honda CR-V, watching as “workers setting out for a lunchtime stroll become spectral silhouettes” and “glass towers unravel into the sky like smoke.” These are suggestive images, full of intrigue and possibility. Still, driverless cars aren’t just a technological marvel; they raise serious urban planning questions.

In terms of safety and parking, they are likely to be a force for good. Perhaps we’ve become numb to the damage because it happens so often, but it’s worth remembering that cars are deadly weapons that we entrust to almost everybody, whatever their competence or emotional stability. Starting this Halloween in New York City, 13 pedestrians were killed by drivers in as many days — including young Bronx trick-or-treaters standing on the sidewalk. In 2013, drivers in Mexico City killed 491 pedestrians. Everyone has had a close brush with a driver who is texting, eating, applying mascara or falling asleep at the wheel. By contrast, autonomous vehicles are so cautious that they often have trouble crossing intersections, and recently one got pulled over by police for driving too slowly."

An intense political fight has erupted since the Feb. 13 death of long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, as Republicans maneuver to foil Obama's ability to choose a replacement who could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. The Senate must confirm any high court nominee.

""The Constitution vests in the president the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. It's a duty that I take seriously, and one that I will fulfill in the weeks ahead,"" Obama, sounding undeterred by the Republican-led Senate's opposition, wrote in a blog post on the independent SCOTUSblog.com website.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Tuesday that the Republican-led Senate will not hold hearings or vote on any Supreme Court nominee until after the next president takes office in January.

Obama did not appear deterred in his blog post, writing: ""As senators prepare to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to consider the person I appoint, I hope they'll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the court can continue to serve the American people at full strength.""

Obama, who did not mention potential candidates by name, laid out a list of qualifications he would seek in a nominee who he promised would be ""eminently qualified.""

""He or she will have an independent mind, rigorous intellect, impeccable credentials and a record of excellence and integrity,"" Obama wrote.

In an apparent nod to conservatives who decry ""activist judges,"" Obama said his appointee ""will be someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary’s role; who understands that a judge’s job is to interpret the law, not make the law.""

He said he also wants a nominee who has life experience to understand that justice is not about abstract legal theory and ""grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people’s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times.""

The U.S. presidential election is set for Nov. 8 and Republicans want the next president to fill Scalia's vacancy, hoping a Republican will be elected.

Scalia's death left the shorthanded court with four liberals and four conservatives, with Obama's nominee positioned to change the court's ideological balance.

Obama already has appointed two Supreme Court justices during his seven years as president. The Senate confirmed his prior two nominees — Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Elena Kagan in 2010 — but the chamber was controlled by Obama's fellow Democrats at the time.

The reality is that low-income constituents, women and people of color are not getting their fair share from the U.S. government. A new study by University of California researcher Zoltan L. Hajnal, currently under review by co-authors John Griffin, Brian Newman, and David Searle, examines the effects of class, race and gender on representation.

Their findings are stunning: For white people, class works as expected, with richer whites getting better representation than poorer whites. But, for black people, there is no class effect and high-income black households receive slightly less political representation than low-income black families. The authors also found that black women’s voices “are likely to overlooked” in policy decisions more than any other minority group.

For years, studies on representation focused primarily on class, education and political knowledge. In 2004 a task force commissioned by the American Political Science Association’s cautioned that (PDF) the United States’ “ideals of equal citizenship and responsive government may be under growing threat in an era of persistence and rising inequalities.” This prompted academics to dive deeper into the question of how race affects political influence and representation.

In their seminal 2009 book, “Minority Report,” political scientists Brian Newman and John Griffin found that black people and Hispanics had less representation than whites. More recently, legal scholar Nicholas Stephanopoulos analyzed data from state exit polls and legislative outcomes over three decades and found that women, poor people and minorities had very little representation.

Hajnal and his co-authors use more than 40 years of data on preferences of individual voters for spending in 11 key federal policies, including foreign aid, crime and healthcare, to measure government responsiveness. The authors then examine government spending on those issues to see whether the government enacted the policy preferences of minorities and low-income individuals or not. (The authors treated those whose government spending preferences were enacted as winners and those whose preferences were ignored as policy losers.)

All groups enjoyed gains ranging from 30 to 40 percent based on spending preferences vis-à-vis spending outcomes. But the authors found a significant gap in representation across racial groups: Black people were policy winners 31.9 percent of the time, compared with 37.6 percent for white people. Asians enjoyed more representation than blacks and whites, Hispanics slightly less so. (The General Social Survey on Hispanics and Asian Americans is limited to a period of 10 years and thus not entirely comparable.) As the table below illustrates, there’s a 5.7 percentage point difference between blacks and whites, a 1.5-point difference between high-and low-income earners and 4.1 percentage difference based on educational status."

During the summit, Abe and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, agreed to a “special strategic and global partnership” premised on closer cooperation, economically and through stronger bonds on defense and security.

Japan’s approach to Asia — especially its relationship with India — has been reinforced by Abe’s hard line against Chinese assertiveness and his desire to tap into India’s rich investment opportunities. Ties with India have also blossomed because of the amicable personal relationship between Abe and Modi, who knew each other for years before taking their current positions.

The China-Japan relationship, despite some recent signs of improvement, has been toxic for the past several years as a result of the two countries’ territorial dispute in the East China Sea. Amplifying these tensions are Tokyo’s concerns about Beijing’s defense posture, cyberattacks and military modernization, especially in the maritime domain. India also has a complicated relationship with China and remains wary of its territorial claims in their disputed border region. Additionally, India is concerned with the growing security relationship between its traditional regional rival, Pakistan, and China.

There were three key takeaways from the recent Abe-Modi meeting, each of which will continue to shape the region’s geopolitical landscape. First, Japan won a lucrative $12 billion contract to help India build its first high-speed rail project. The massive investment deal will link Mumbai to Ahmedabad through the construction of a Japanese-style bullet train. The infusion of Japan’s high-speed rail technology has the potential to be an enormous boon for India’s transportation sector. Moreover, the pact follows up on Japan’s multibillion-dollar deal to help build Delhi’s new mass rapid transit system.

The high-speed train deal is also significant because it follows Japan’s failed bid to provide similar technological assistance to Indonesia, losing out to China, which made the winning bid to construct the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail line. Securing the rail deal with India has allowed Japan to recoup some of its losses and refocus its energies on the Indian transportation market.

Second, the two countries enjoy a budding relationship in the transfer of civilian nuclear energy and related technologies. After years of painstaking negotiations, both sides agreed to work toward completing their long-standing discussions on enhancing civilian nuclear cooperation. Japan’s strong nuclear nonproliferation commitments and principles collided with the notion of open nuclear trade with India, a state that remains outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."

The opposition has long been divided along ideological lines and because of rampant political opportunism. But it has learned from the 2010 elections, when it boycotted the electoral process and ended up with no voice in the parliament, little visibility in the country and faced repression from the ruling party. Three scenarios have now emerged within the opposition. First, Agathon Rwasa, former leader of the opposition National Liberation Forces, has been elected a deputy speaker of parliament after coming second in the presidential elections with 20 percent of the vote. Critics have accused Rwasa of making a U-turn after criticizing the electoral process on the campaign trail and being bought off by the regime. But the new role gives Rwasa’s party a platform and could make him a key deal broker in future negotiations.

Breaking the cycle of violence in Burundi requires sustained and resolute diplomatic actions from African countries and donors, particularly the EU and the United States.

The committee dropped Boston in July amid tenacious activism, wavering politicians and paltry polling numbers.

Los Angelenos should emulate Bostonians to make sure that their political leaders say no. The Olympic games tend to militarize the host city and go over budget, saddling taxpayers with lopsided fiscal risk while private groups pile up profits. What’s more, the United States’ appalling human rights record should rule the country out as a host.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has an inglorious track record of awarding the Games to unsavory human rights violators. Russia hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, despite an anti-LGBT law that contradicted the Olympic Charter. Beijing will again be hosting the 2022 Winter Games, even as China continues imprisoning journalists and its oppressive practices in Tibet. Beijing won the 2022 games narrowly beating Almaty, Kazakhstan, where torture is common and President Nursultan Nazarbayev has ruled the country since 1989, winning elections by wide margins — he was re-elected in April with a whopping 97.7 percent of the vote.

In addition to Los Angeles, the IOC has a gaggle of cities vying for the 2024 Summer Games: Hamburg, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Paris; Rome; and possibly Toronto. Many consider L.A. a front-runner, in part thanks to the city’s history of hosting successful Olympics in 1932 and 1984. The USOC has worked diligently to position itself to win, compromising on a thorny revenue-sharing dispute with the IOC and embedding its people into key positions in the IOC.

But the USOC should be spurned. The United States’ horrific human rights record breaches the Olympic Charter’s fundamental principles of Olympism (PDF), which calls for leading by example, social responsibility and respect for universal ethics. The objections over the awarding of Olympic Games to other human rights violators such as China and Russia should also apply to the United States. In fact, the U.S. is a ghastly maverick in many respects. Look no further than the Guantánamo Bay prison in Cuba, where more than 100 detainees — most of them without a single charge — continue to languish.

Since former President George W. Bush opened the Guantánamo facility in 2002, nearly 800 people have passed through its gates. The U.S. government’s treatment of the detainees, including torture and the force-feeding of hunger striking inmates, offends against the Olympic Charter’s insistence on “the preservation of human dignity.”"

The U.S.-backed resolution, which is co-sponsored by Qatar, France and other Arab and Western countries, signals Riyadh’s growing influence at the world body.

In mid-September, the appointment of Saudi Arabia's ambassador as chair of the United Nations Human Rights Council's consultative group, an honorary position with limited powers, made global headlines. But Saudi Arabia's real diplomatic triumph came a few weeks later. On Sept. 30, Riyadh blocked a draft resolution put forward by the Netherlands that called for an international inquiry into the Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen. The victory placed an otherwise discreet Saudi Foreign Service at the center of multilateral politics.

Saudi Arabia killed the Dutch resolution by rallying the support of the Arab group. It then introduced an alternative text (through the Arab bloc with Saudi diplomats as pen holders) that was adopted on Oct. 2. The Arab group resolution simply called on the U.N. to assist a national inquiry by Yemen’s Saudi-backed government. It dropped language on “all parties” to the conflict, which resulted in the resolution ignoring violations committed by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies.

The United States, France and the United Kingdom helped the Saudis bury the international probe by providing late and weak support for the Dutch proposal and by insisting on the need to “strike a deal” with Riyadh. Saudi Arabia now occupies an elevated geopolitical posture that could have far-reaching, devastating consequences for the Middle East. Growing Saudi influence underscores the Council’s failure to fulfill its mandate of fighting human rights violations, combating impunity and preventing repetition.

The Saudis can now continue to challenge international human rights standards, including on freedom of expression, torture and execution of minors. For example, the Kingdom could now re-open the “defamation of religion” agenda, which aims to place restrictions on free expression based on religious grounds. (Riyadh and its regional allies had in the past attempted to get the concept of defamation of religion recognized in international law.)

There are many reasons for Western governments’ acquiescence toward Saudi Arabia: The Saudis are outraged by the recent nuclear deal with Iran; Riyadh is a key ally in the Syrian crisis and the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL); Saudi is an attractive market for Western businesses (last month France signed 10-billion-euros worth of deals with Saudi Arabia, which includes energy, health, agro-industry and arms trade)."

California Teachers Association, to determine whether public-sector unions could still require workers who opt out of union membership to pay some dues. The suit seeks to overturn a 1977 decision, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, which held that unions could charge non-members an “agency shop” fee to cover costs related to representation in collective bargaining.

Conservatives argue that unions are inherently political, and so forcing workers to support them financially violates free speech rights. If the court’s conservative majority overturns the precedent, government workers could opt out of dues payments in droves, severely crippling the financing of public employee unions, a pivotal part of the American labor movement.

Unions argue that non-members should pay a smaller membership fee because they reap the benefits from union representation — everything from high quality health and dental plans to protections against arbitrary terminations. But last year, in ruling narrowly against unions in Harris v. Quinn, the Court indicated its interest in hearing a free speech challenge to overturn the four-decade-old precedent.

The fear of a nationwide right-to-work regime, in which unions can make no claims on any workers despite representing their interests, is not far-fetched. Even the liberal wing of the court has recently ruled against labor. And despite unions’ importance for workers’ rights, it is often difficult to convince government employees to pay their dues. Still, in some states with right-to-work laws, unions have been successful in retaining membership. In fact, recent data show that right-to-work legislation in Indiana hasn’t caused a change for unions there.

But some labor activists are bracing for a deathblow to the public sector unions, especially among lower-paid workers who in tight economic times are looking for any way to increase their take-home pay.

“The elephant in the room is that plenty of represented workers aren’t enthusiastic about their unions,” Labor Notes staff writer, Samantha Winslow, observed earlier this month. “Some see them as the contract, pure and simple — an insurance policy at best, not something that gets your blood moving. Others have the opposite gripe — that their unions focus on advocating for causes far removed from members’ day-to-day work.”

In other words, even some labor advocates have admitted that the automatic-dues payment system for all workers has made unions complacent, and labor’s enemies are taking advantage of that.

A right-to-work regime could mean far less money for government workers’ unions, which means less representation, fewer lawyers and fewer member services. For those of us who work in the public-sector labor movement (I edit a magazine published by a government union), careers hang in the balance. Dramatic reductions in operational resources will most certainly end up in staff reductions."

Hannelore Foerster / Bloomberg / Getty Images

Volkswagen isn’t the only carmaker whose future suddenly looks bleaker than ever before. So far, Europe’s largest automobile producer is the only one to have been caught cheating on emissions tests — a state of affairs that could well soon change. Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it had proof that the fabled German company had systematically deceived regulators in the U.S. (and the Germans now say in Europe, too) over the pollutants that 11 million of its diesel vehicles emit on roads across the world. Even if no other carmaker becomes implicated, the VW debacle has dire implications for the industry’s bottom line. VW’s rigging of test results wasn’t the gaffe of a loose cannon in the branch but rather the desperate act of an industry giant who realized that the century-long reign of the automobile as we have known it is skidding to an end. The era of the internal combustion engine — the centerpiece of every fossil-fuel burning automobile — is in its twilight, and automakers that continue to stake everything on it, as is the case with Germany’s carmakers and most of those in the U.S. and Asia, too — will pay a very high price. They err in fighting off — rather than throwing in their lot with — a new age of modern mobility, namely climate-friendly transportation based on electric and hydrogen-fueled vehicles, biofuels, bicycles and e-bikes, and public transportation.

A coddled industry

It’s not coincidence that this scandal happened in Germany or that the culprit is Volkswagen. In Germany, the automobile is king like nowhere else in the world: The industry is the most cherished, supported, protected, and pampered in the country. It was, after all, in 1886 that German Karl Benz patented the first vehicle (three-wheeled!) powered by a gas engine, which is widely acknowledged as the birth of the modern automobile. Since then, there has been no looking back. Today the auto sector’s turnover is $430 billion, about 20 percent of German industry’s revenue. Its specialty: heavy, gas-guzzling luxury models. Germany accounts for a third of Europe’s automobile production. One in every five cars worldwide is a German make. The industry turbo-powers Germany’s booming export trade: a record-breaking 77 percent of cars produced in Germany last year were sold abroad. In Germany alone, the auto industry employs 775,000 people. VW leads in every category — size, earnings, exports and number of workers — and employees 600,000 worldwide. So important is the sector that politicians from all the parties fall over themselves to serve the auto lobby. Germany may have the reputation of prioritizing environmental issues and climate protection (and lecturing other countries on it) but biggering the automobile industry’s record production figures from year to year is much, much more important. (VW and its competitors love to play along, underscoring their green intentions.) But Germany is the only country in the world without a speed limit on its highways — a sacrosanct perk that the car lobby defends to the hilt. More damning, just this year Germany headed up a rebellion of automobile-manufacturing nations in the European Union against more stringent emissions standards for vehicles of the future. The standards had already been hammered out after months of negotiations in Brussels. But Germany would not accept no as an answer and even, according to The Guardian, pushed the EU to keep loopholes in testing that would increase CO2 emissions by 14 percent. Berlin’s lobbying began just after the 2009 national vote, which reelected Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Christian Democrats. Shortly after the election, Merkel’s party was publically put on the spot by revelations that it received donations totaling $828,000 from the family that in effect controls BMW. But the embarrassment didn’t stop Merkel from fighting tooth and nail to block the tougher exhaust emission standards for big cars. Obviously neither her environment minster nor the German version of the EPA had clout enough to outweigh the car industry. (Germany’s Umweltbundesamt doesn’t have anything close to the powers of the EPA, which is at least one reason that the VW issue was detected in the U.S. and not Germany.)

Germany refuses to face the reality that the era of the big car is over.

Moreover, the CEOs of VW, Mercedes Benz, BMW and Porsche have favored access to the chancellery and the Bundestag. The automobile lobby and the sector itself is stocked with former politicians, more than a handful of the big guns from previous Merkel administrations.

Can’t compete

So, why all this coddling if German prowess in automobile manufacturing is so elite? After all, its carmakers are breaking one production record after another in the middle of a Europe-wide economic crisis. Because such special treatment is critical now in an age in which emissions standards are ever higher and competition to produce more efficient, less polluting cars is ever greater. VW had to cheat on the emissions tests because otherwise its diesel-fueled motors couldn’t compete. The ever tougher standards for internal combustion vehicles and high fuel prices means that VW and its peers can’t rule the road the way they had in the past. The day of reckoning, it appears, came sooner for VW than it had imagined. And since the motor is just about is the only part of the automobile that producers manufacture these days, it would have been out of business in the diesel sector — or at least earning a lot less — if it hadn’t cheated. This inordinate reputation and lobbying clout over the decades is one reason that the German auto sector is in this pickle to begin with: It has undermined German carmakers’ motivation to innovate and devote more resources to the development of carbon-neutral mobility. Merkel’s “approach is tremendously shortsighted,” wrote the weekly Spiegel magazine in 2013. “Merkel's tactics spare the strong German car industry the need to innovate. The auto companies rely on the behind-the-scenes maneuvering of their chief lobbyists in the chancellery rather than investing early on in models with lower fuel consumption.” This is one reason why electromobility is taking off in many places — but not in Germany. German carmakers make a lot of noise about alternative mobility but they’ve come up with nothing compared to Tesla’s Model S. There are less than a tenth of the e-cars on the road in Germany than in California alone. (Oslo, Norway’s capital city, boasts more registered plug-ins than all of Germany.) German experts such as Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, an electromobility expert at the University of Duisburg-Essen, told me that German automakers are losing the battle for the e-car market. All they can offer, he told me, were “gimmicks” that make headlines for a week and then disappear. “The German carmakers roll out some fancy new thing every now and then to divert attention from the fact they’ve been so slow in getting their own e-cars on the road,” he said. One reason for this is lack of government support: Unlike France and the UK, Germany doesn’t offer rebates or premiums (between $5,000 and $8,000) for the purchase of e-cars.

This isn’t just emotionally devastating to new mothers and perilous for their children; for many women, it’s also a form of physical torture.

In a country where high-profile women such as Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer are upheld as heroes for returning to work within weeks of giving birth — and, in Mayer’s case, working remotely from the hospital throughout her first labor and vowing to power through her just-announced pregnancy (twins!) and return to the office posthaste — it’s all too easy to imagine childbirth in the United States today as a simple, routine procedure, not unlike an appendectomy. Yes, it’s uncomfortable, and there are occasional complications, but if you obey your doctor’s orders (and can afford a housekeeper) it can be done smoothly and with a minimum of fuss.

But the reality is that even under the best of circumstances — in a clean, safe environment, with ready access to high-quality emergency medical care — childbirth takes an enormous physical toll. And even for those who have the easiest of births, dealing with the emotional demands of new parenthood can be just as taxing.

Never having given birth myself, I asked a diverse group of women in a variety of professions who have given birth in the last several years to describe how they felt two weeks postpartum. Most of these women were able to take significant time off after having their babies, many received at least partial pay during that time and several have yet to return to full-time work. In other words, by American standards, they are extremely fortunate.

But even women with educational, financial and familial resources find pregnancy and childbirth intensely difficult at best and debilitating at worst. “Two weeks after I gave birth I still looked six months pregnant and felt like my vagina was inside out,” was how one new mom I spoke with described it.

Even so-called “easy” births frequently exact serious physical trauma: “My first baby came out pretty fast but tore me badly, including my perineum, anus and sphincter muscles,” a 34-year-old mother of two told me. “It took me 10 days before I could even walk. I could stand up but I couldn’t lift my legs or twist from side to side. My legs and feet were so swollen I thought my skin was going to split open. ... I also developed mastitis in my left breast, which is incredibly painful. ... You’re told to ‘nurse through the pain,’ but it felt like the jaws of life ripping my chest apart.”

Another new mom I spoke with said that although she could walk again six weeks after giving birth, “sitting, standing and using the bathroom were extremely uncomfortable.” She remembers thinking, “How is it possible that women go back to work this early?” She “could not imagine having to deal with my stitches, bleeding, engorged breasts and lack of sleep while having to constantly engage with coworkers and use a public restroom.”

The woman who suffered from mastitis is equally horrified by the prospect of returning to work so soon. “The idea of going back to work after two weeks is nuts,” she said. “My second child was the easiest labor in the world, and for the first two weeks after I gave birth I still felt like I had been in a bad car accident.”"

As political scientists Thomas Ferguson and Joel Rogers note in “ Right Turn: The Decline of the Democrats and the Future of American Politics ,” in 1979 close to 80 percent of Americans polled thought there was too much power concentrated in large corporations. A majority in the same survey thought that business was making too much and supported a cap on corporate profit.

According to the New Democrats, blue-collar whites were wary of “big government.” By crafting policies palatable to these voters, Clintons and their allies, the story goes, were able to capture the White House and at least guarantee some form of progressive governance, albeit watered down, after the era of Reagan.

This wasn’t a mere case of spousal solidarity: Hillary Clinton’s own ideological background is rooted in the “New Democrat” tradition embraced by her husband’s administration. The New Democrats pursued a “third way” between the European-style social democracy and free-market orthodoxy and rallied together under the auspices of the now defunct Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) in the late 1980s. Their platform was a direct response to the Reagan-era triumph of conservatism and its perceived sway among ordinary voters.

In this pursuit, the president found an ally in his wife. As first lady, Hillary Clinton echoed the administration’s tough-on-crime rhetoric and strongly supported landmark achievements such as the 1996 welfare reform bill, which placed onerous new restrictions and requirements on recipients of the program, and the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Bill Clinton restored Democratic control of the White House in 1992 by wooing back some of these voters. His role in transforming the Democratic Party at the national level throughout the 1990s is undeniable. It was Clinton — not Reagan — who balanced the budget and ended “welfare as we know it,” cementing a long-running reorientation of his party. Where Democrats once sought to expand the welfare state, the Clinton-led party managed its decline.

Ever since Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980 with an appeal to blue-collar whites, politicians have chased the “Reagan Democrat.” The key to capturing swing states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, the theory went, was to win over white workers turned off by “tax-and-spend liberalism” and the excesses of the Democratic Party.

An emerging generation of ‘Sanders Democrats’ will be a thorn in the side of the Democratic leadership caste for a long time to come.

What the Clinton Democrats actually did was build a coalition based around the interests of business, not those of most voters. They knew that they had to replace the fragile alliance between organized labor and the old Democratic business bloc that held together the New Deal (though it may be shocking to recall now, the oil industry was a key component of this) with new elites incorporated from Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

This approach was never popular with working-class voters, even if many still voted for it over Republican alternatives. Over the long run, pro-business and anti-labor policies such as NAFTA only undermined the popular base that Democratic politicians relied on. It wasn’t that poor and working-class people all became Republicans; they just simply weren’t inspired to turn out to vote.

The closeness of this week’s Iowa caucuses, which ended in a virtual tie between Hillary Clinton and Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, is a sign that the New Democrat chickens are coming home to roost. The candidates, after all, could not have more different backgrounds. It’s not just that Clinton is polished and her talking points are carefully vetted, while Sanders is scraggy and more prone to speak off the cuff. Nor is it Sanders’ almost anachronistic background on the socialist left. The difference can be found in their language and the way they frame their appeals — both the style and substance of their politics. Clinton is quick to remind audiences that she “represented Wall Street” as a New York senator. Sanders, on the other hand, speaks of “breaking up” big banks, calls for a “political revolution” and doesn’t flinch from his socialist identity.

President Barack Obama, despite his promises of change during and after his 2008 primary battle with Clinton, has represented continuity with much of the DLC agenda. Yet many Democratic voters have opposed New Democratic policies, as well as Clinton’s closeness with Wall Street and aggressive stances on foreign policy, including her vote in favor of the Iraq War as a senator from New York.

Sanders’ success is less the result of his individual merits as a candidate than of the tensions between the party’s base and its leadership class. Even if he loses the race this year, there is a real possibility that an emerging generation of “Sanders Democrats” — pushing traditional social-democratic solutions, such as universal health care and public jobs programs, to the country’s problems — will be a thorn in the side of the Democratic leadership caste for a long time to come.

A party that has been chasing “Reagan Democrats” since the 1980s will struggle to adjust without losing its powerful business allies. If history is any guide, party elites will choose their funders over their voters, and the huge numbers of millennials who support Sanders and his political vision will have to express their rage and discontent elsewhere.

It’s hard to say what form that outrage will take, but it’s enough to wonder whether Clinton solutions can triangulate the problems of this era as well as they did two decades ago."

The wave of violence had five targets: Russia, Egypt, Hezbollah, Lebanon and France. The ambitiousness of these actions appears to mark a shift in ISIL’s strategy that will likely trigger heightened military attacks against its facilities, supply lines and leaders. After the Paris attacks, French President François Hollande promised a “merciless” response against ISIL. All five targeted foes will undoubtedly step up the military means they have already used against ISIL in Syria, Lebanon and Sinai. The United States and others who fight ISIL will also expand their attacks. Global military and intelligence coordination against ISIL will be enhanced significantly. But all this will probably not succeed if those fighting ISIL simply repeat the military-heavy strategy that has not destroyed Al-Qaeda in the past 17 years of nonstop attacks. In fact, it will further ISIL’s strategy of destabilizing the Middle East and drawing all sides into a conflagration of violence. The more critical and urgent strategy that is needed now in view of ISIL’s widening circle of targets abroad — but that has never been attempted — is to accompany military attacks with serious actions to address the underlying political, economic and social drivers that created and maintain ISIL.

Futile military solutions

Since U.S. President Bill Clinton first attacked Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Sudan in August 1998, that group has survived, decentralized and even expanded in areas of chaos such as Yemen and Afghanistan. ISIL and Al-Qaeda may be the fastest growing political brand names in the Middle East and South Asia, where they continue to gain adherents and establish affiliated groups across many lands. They remain relatively small operations with just some thousands of hardcore members, compared to much bigger and more established nationalist Islamist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood, Ansarullah (Houthis) in Yemen, or the Mahdi Army (Sadrists) in Iraq. Yet their ability to create havoc through terror attacks remains high. ISIL will find it more difficult to keep expanding its “state,” now that both the U.S. and Russia are actively attacking it and other militant Islamists in Syria and Iraq, and regional powers such as Iran and Turkey are joining the fight. But it is the time for all those Middle Eastern and foreign powers seeking to defeat ISIL to acknowledge that their military actions alone will not succeed. They must find a way to work with Middle Eastern societies to start targeting and reforming the underlying drivers of discontent, mainly in Arab countries, that have funneled recruits and funds to Islamist militants for the past few decades. The power of ISIL resides not in its military prowess or frightening brutality, but in the very extensive list of reasons why individuals in the Middle East and abroad join or support it. Examining these reasons may provide an agenda of structural problems within the Arab World that must be solved, if we hope to defeat ISIL and avoid seeing it replaced by something more vicious. The common denominator among ISIL adherents appears to be a combined sense of anger at current conditions — no jobs, no income, no voice, no power — and hopelessness about improving their future wellbeing. This same combination of anger and helplessness also sparked the non-violent Arab uprisings in 2010-11, which have mostly failed to deliver on their promise. In fact, both material and political conditions have worsened for most young people in the region since then. In the mind of those who join ISIL, the group promises to overturn corrupt political systems and offer a new life in the Islamic State and the wider utopian Caliphate that would protect all Muslims and provide them with a decent life.

Disrupting groups such as ISIL militarily without removing the causes that give them life is a fool’s strategy.

Sustained military attacks alone have proven difficult to eradicate Al-Qaeda and ISIL, because they merely augment the social, economic, psychological and political stresses that generate mass discontent, vulnerability and desperation and create new ISIL recruits faster than Arab and foreign armies can kill them. In some cases, the assaults against ISIL reinforce one of its main attractions — the sense among some Sunni Muslims that their religion is under attack and must be defended, and only ISIL and similar groups seem to defend them. Military attacks against Muslim majority states such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Yemen and Libya also create new zones of anarchy, which are the prized recruiting grounds for ISIL and Al-Qaeda.

As a divorced black mother raising her son alone in Chicago, she said people often assume her 7-year-old son is the result of a casual relationship or one-night stand, though she was married to his father. She has a master’s degree and is financially stable in her career at an interfaith youth organization, but some teachers and administrators at her son’s school conclude that she is low-income and lacks literacy skills. “No one asks if I can come to school to volunteer at school or go to career day,” she said.

Single mothers are frequently used as a case study for society’s many ills, with many politicians quick to blame this vulnerable group of people. Presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., for instance, blamed the protests in Baltimore on “the breakdown of the family structure, the lack of fathers, the lack of sort of a moral code in our society.” On the 50th anniversary of the war on poverty, Rep. Louie Gohmert , R-Texas, made a speech suggesting single mothers were abusing welfare programs. According to him, in the 1960s the federal government enabled these women’s undesirable behavior by providing them financial support. Former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., recently condemned single mothers for “the decay of the American family” and has blamed the government for encouraging women to have children out of wedlock, which perpetuates poverty. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., another presidential candidate, said that single moms are “ breeding more criminals ” and are ruining the country.

Despite clearly changing family structures, American society and many of its political leaders continue to harshly judge those who don’t fit a more traditional mold. For instance, we rarely see positive representations of single motherhood, particularly when it comes to women of color.

This kind of stigma against single mothers is associated with health problems. According to a recent study in The Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, single mothers have a higher risk of poor health and disability as they age. Much of this is attributed to the high levels of social isolation and insufficient support many women experience, making it hard for them to take care of themselves and raise healthy families.

There are more than 7.3 million families headed by single mothers in this country. In 2013 more than a quarter of these families — over 2 million — were poor, with almost 2.5 million more struggling to make ends meet. But we can’t blame this on women’s single status, nor can we expect marriage to be the solution to these complicated problems. According to research, children with two parents are better off in school and in their relationships than those with only one parent. But this doesn't mean we should shame single mothers. Our society is set up so that affluent, heterosexual couples with children are the kinds of families most likely to flourish. For instance, there are currently more than 1,000 laws — including tax breaks — that benefit people who are legally married. Though there are laws to protect workers from discrimination based on sex, gender and pregnancy, none prohibit discrimination based on family status.

Lane was fortunate enough to have her sister live with her and help care for her son, which enabled her to advance her career. “We should support how families are connected and supported,” she said. “We live in a world where people can’t understand that our family looks this way. There’s nothing in our financial structure that honors that.” She pointed out the lack of tax breaks for the kind of child care her sister provided.

For many of us women, our lives look neither like a 1950s sitcom nor like the more contemporary narratives (most recently brought to life in Kate Bolick’s popular memoir, “Spinster: Making a Life of One’s Own”) of privileged white women opting out of married life. Families come in all forms. Many parents are single or are in domestic partnerships. Some households consist of relatives and friends. Some choose to raise children by themselves, while others parent alone by circumstance. We need to respect all realities and provide support for struggling single mothers by addressing the wage gap and pushing for affordable health care, child care and housing — solutions that would improve the lives of all women and children."

Wade, a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that protected women’s right to make personal medical decisions, including the right to have an abortion.

One-third of women in the United States will have an abortion by the age of 45. The overwhelming majority of those who choose abortion do so because it’s economically the best decision for their families. Yet the constitutional protection for women’s rights to choose recognized by Roe v. Wade now faces new threats from politicians.

Access to abortion is a fundamental human right. A woman’s right to choose a safe and legal abortion is also part of the Democratic Party’s platform. Voters often evaluate candidates for public office on the basis of their abortion stances. Yet at the fourth Democratic presidential debate, on Jan. 17, contenders were not asked a single question on the topic. As a black woman who has had an abortion, I find this deeply disappointing. Similarly, President Barack Obama did not mention the fight to protect reproductive rights in his final State of the Union address. This raises the question, Are Democrats taking this issue and voter support for granted?

Abortion remains a key issue in the 2016 election. For the first time in a decade, the U.S. Supreme Court may take up an abortion case. There are unprecedented attacks on abortion — legislatively and literally — including the murder of three people at a Colorado Springs, Colorado, Planned Parenthood clinic in November.

So far, most Democrats have appeared deaf to these threats. The party must help candidates tell voters what their plans are for ensuring every woman’s right to decide if, when and how to become a parent — free from violence and government interference.

In a recent New York Times Magazine interview, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, said she sees a “complacency” among young women who grew up after Roe v. Wade. She later acknowledged that she is unaware of some of the ways in which young people are organizing — clinic escorting, ensuring people are able to afford and have rides to and from their abortions and working in reproductive health care organizations.

Other party leaders have expressed ambivalence. “I don’t believe in abortion on demand,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told Roll Call on Jan. 13. “I don’t even like to use the word “abortion.” That’s my generation … but this is something so personal.”

Unlike Pelosi, I do not feel such reservations. I talk about my abortion openly and support increasing access to abortion because I believe every woman should have that option if she needs it. It’s clear that the party leadership is perpetuating abortion stigma. This is isn’t a generational crisis or a young people’s problem. There are hundreds of women who can share abortion stories. That is exactly what we need do to fight the Texas law that is currently before the Supreme Court and will be decided by the end of June. Among other restrictions, the law prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and requires abortion clinics to meet hospital-style surgical standards — an unnecessary and costly burden.

Republican presidential candidates are arguing over who would ban abortion and contraception faster. And many anti-abortion politicians won’t even have a conversation on increasing access to contraception. But what is the Democratic plan to challenge them?"

The poorest of these women work in laundries. Barred from medical school because of their gender, educated middle class women run apothecaries instead. The wealthy run homes.

By the time the movie begins, all of them are fed up with acting like ladies.

“I was initially resistant because I had a very conservative view of the suffragettes. They were ladies with wide-brimmed hats and tambourines and corsets,” said Abi Morgan, the film’s screenwriter, when asked why she wanted to tell this story. Her “revelation” came when she was exposed to the testimonials of working women from that time. “So many of those things are incredibly relevant to today, from equal pay issues at work through to sexual violence, custodial rights to children, property rights and education issues.”

She was especially appalled to learn that the suffragettes were under what was then cutting-edge police surveillance. Reading police records from that time, she said, “you realize the extent of the surveillance … and level of intimidation of these women by the police, and that felt very globally relevant in the 21st century.” Many of the records she consulted in writing the film were declassified only in 2003 and revealed that covert surveillance techniques such as photographing suspects without their knowledge were pioneered by Scotland Yard to combat the suffragettes.

Knowing this history made Morgan reluctant to sugarcoat the women’s lives. The characters who toil in laundries work miserably long hours, suffer from work-related respiratory illnesses and are raped by their boss. All the main characters are bullied, patronized or humiliated by men — bosses, husbands, government officials and police. Contrast this with Charlie Chaplin’s 1914 performance of “The Militant Suffragette,” which mocked women fighting for voting rights, or a half-century later, the character of Winifred Banks, the flighty mother and suffragette in Walt Disney’s film “Mary Poppins.”

Acknowledgment of what women gave up to get the vote is long overdue. It is impossible to understand contemporary feminism without knowing women’s history. Few movies get made about women, period, and fewer still about their ongoing global struggle to be recognized as human beings and citizens. As text that appears onscreen at the end of “Suffragette” reminds us, it wasn’t until August of this year that Saudi women were able to vote.

Nor do the filmmakers shy away from the gory aftermath of rebellion. Miscreant women are beaten and thrown into jail; they go on hunger strikes and are force-fed. The women in “Suffragette” are members of an oppressed class whose violent rebellion is presented as not only justified but also, to paraphrase John F. Kennedy, made inevitable by the failure of more peaceful methods."

What is Putin really up to?

Putin is often seen as unpredictable, but, secretive as he might be, his motivations are simple and unchanging — to maintain and increase his own power and Russia’s. The two are one and the same for him. Like King Louis XIV, Putin could also say, I am the state.

Putin’s specialty is identifying situations in which power and interests are in the early stages of shifting — and then to act quickly and decisively. That is what he did in Ukraine, for better or worse, and that is what he is doing now in Syria.

But it isn’t events in Syria itself that matter so much here. What Putin sees is that the Syrian war is causing a refugee crisis in Europe. That crisis is already causing serious economic and political strains. It is now very much in Europe’s interest for the stream of refugees to be stemmed as soon as possible. Anyone seen acting to stop that war and stem that flood will be perceived as acting in Europe’s immediate vital interests.

Putin’s most immediate vital interest is the easing or lifting of the sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and proxy war in eastern Ukraine. Coupled with the nosedive of oil prices, the sanctions are now causing harm to his entourage and constituencies, as well as to the economy in general. The example of Iran proves two things: Sanctions work and, sooner or later, sanctions will be lifted. Unlike Iran, Putin will not seek to come to an agreement with the U.S. and Europe. Rather, he will continue to take steps that will be viewed in Europe as serving its vital interests: slowing the flood of refugees, and taking on ISIL directly.

And so Putin’s moves in Syria are first and foremost about Ukraine, money and his own power. Though Putin is often likened to a chess player, here he appears more like a pool player doing an off-the-cushion shot and using the Syria ball to knock Ukraine into the pocket.

Putin, however, does have other interests in Syria. By forming an intelligence alliance with Syria, Iran and Iraq, Putin presents the U.S. with an impossible choice. It can join in, which essentially means implicitly recognizing the current Syrian regime as legitimate (and siding publicly with Iran), or not join in and be seen as stranded on moral high ground."

Republika Srpska je izašla iz Daytona onog trenutka kada je Narodna skupština tog bh. entiteta donijela doluku o referendumu, a koja se odnosila na rad državnog sudstva i tužilaštva, kaže dr. Nerzuk Ćurak, profesor na Fakultetu političkih nauka u Sarajevu i autor više knjiga i naučnih radova iz oblasti geopolitike, a u vezi novog feferenduma, kojeg vlasti u RS-u najavljuju za septembar.

Šta se sve krije iza pojma referendum, šta će se desiti nakon što bude održan, na koj način i zašto se zaustavljaju eurointegracijski procesi, ali i intergacijski procesi unutar same Bosne i Hercegovine, kakva je uloga bh. političkih elita, a kakva Srbije i drugih stranih sila u egzekuciji Bosne i Hercegovine. Ćurak govori u intervjuu za Al Jazeeru Balkans.

Najava referenduma u RS-u, pa i kontrareferenduma, koji se najavljuje kako bi se Srebrenica izdvojila iz RS-a, posmatra se i tumači uglavnom na dva načina - ili kao prijetnja miru, ili kao politički marketing uoči predstojećih lokalnih izbora u Bosni i Hercegovini. O čemu se tu, zaista, radi?

- Najjednostavniji odgovor smiješta ovu ujdurmu oko referenduma u sferu političkog marketinga uoči lokalnih oktobarskih izbora. Nema nikakve sumnje da će Milorad Dodik, Savez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata i koalicioni partneri eventualnom provedbom referenduma netom pred komunalne izbore profitirati i u značajnoj mjeri neutralizirati loše rezultate njihove aktualne vlasti u RS-u. Također, stranke okupljene oko ideje da Ćamil Duraković ponovo bude načelnik općine Srebrenica homogenizirat će biračko tijelo iznuđenom, reaktivnom idejom o lokalnom referendumu za izdvajanje Srebrenice iz RS-a. Ipak, ta očiglednost nije dovoljna za stvarno i suštinsko razumijevanje političkih namjera Dodika i njegovog anahronog nacionalističkog gremija.

Da je u pitanju samo i samo predizborno osnaživanje SNSD-a, ne bi srpska opozicija u RS-u unisono i jedinstveno podržala referendum i de facto, sa stanovišta političkog marketinga, sebi zabila nož u leđa, slabeći svoje izborne šanse na narednim lokalnim izborima. Zato najavljeni referendum u RS-u moramo motriti i u nekom drugom ključu, jer zašto bi neko ko pokušava već godinama oduzeti vlast Dodiku (opozicija predvođena Srpskom demokratskom strankom) unaprijed pristao na lošiji izborni rezultat od očekivanog, a to će se najvjerovatnije desiti ako dođe do referenduma, koji će ojačati poziciju aktualnih banjalučkih vlastodržaca pred oktobarsku provjeru narodne volje.

To implicira drugu narav referenduma i upućuje nas na stratešku dimenziju najavljenog srpskog plebiscita - kako za srpsku političku elitu u RS-u, tako i za vladajuću političku garnituru u Srbiji. Ako imamo u vidu taj strateški momenat, onda se ne smije nasjesti na lapidarnu retoriku kojom se sam referendum, u režiji onih koji ga organiziraju, minimizira i relativizira, svodeći ga na ""praznik demokratije"", zbog kojega ne treba ""dizati frku"", dževu, zvati u pomoć međunarodnu zajednicu i slično. Iako se ništa bitno neće promijeniti u životima ljudi dan poslije, benigna deskripcija antiustavnog referenduma upravo ima za cilj sakriti njegovu intencionalnu malignost - dugotrajni i nezaustavljivi rast kancera u ionako bolesnom tijelu Bosne i Hercegovine.

Šta je, onda u pitanju? Kakva strategija stoji iza referenduma i koje ona implikacije nosi sa sobom?

- Sami čin referendumskog glasanja i eventualni izlazak velikog broja građana RS-a na taj nesupsidijarni referendum već označava novu klicu stare secesijske strategije, koja je ponovo izvađena iz ladica i poprima formu političke akcije. Naprosto, bez obzira na sva nastojanja međunarodne zajednice da se Dejtonski sporazum čita, interpretira i realizira u integracijskom ključu, strateška odluka Narodne skupštine RS-a, ispoljena kroz rezolucijske akte o antidejtonskim referendumima, je da se Dayton čita, interpretira i realizira u dezintegracijskom ključu. Ovaj referendum smjera ka stvaranju snažnog političkosimboličkog kapitala s ciljem da se zaustave integracijski procesi unutar Bosne i Hercegovine, a koji se doimaju nužnim u novoj fazi eurointegracijskih politika.

Dodikov cilj je da sa referendumom uspije kao što je uspio i s Mehanizmom koordinacije - prateći Srbiju, ići ka Evropskoj uniji, ali tako da Bosna i Hercegovina i dalje bude ispražnjena od bilo kakvog državnog sadržaja. Istovremeno, propadne li putovanje Srbije na Zapad, uvijek se može, i na krilima organiziranih i neorganiziranih antizapadnih referenduma, potražiti pomoć od majčice Rusije.

Ono o čemu možda sami organizatori referenduma ne vode računa je da bi mogli upasti u veliku grešku - Dodik je svu svoju političku egzistenciju zasnovao na tome da se treba držati Daytona i uspio se lukavstvom političkog uma svijetu ""prodati"" kao dejtonofiličar, iako svih ovih godina upravo on najviše krši Dayton. S najavljenim referendumom, Dodik gubi moć političke reprezentacije zasnovane na afirmaciji Dejtonskog sporazuma i u međunarodnim krugovima (američka administracija je to jasno prepoznala) biva markiran kao egzekutor Bosne i Hercegovine u dejtonskom periodu, najdosljedniji sljedbenik ratne politike SDS-a.

Upravo je referendum antidejtonska kategorija...

- Antidejtonska, par excellence! Predsjednik RS-a, ustvari, referendumom gubi pokriće za višegodišnju mantru da ne smije nikad doći do bilo kakve promjene Dejtonskog sporazuma, izuzev one koja vodi raspadu zemlje. De facto, kada je Narodna skupština RS-a donijela odluku o referendumu, a koja se odnosila na rad državnog sudstva i tužilaštva, RS je izašao iz Daytona! Tim činom je Narodna skupština RS-a stvorila pretpostavke za jednu zbiljsku unutrašnju transformaciju Bosne i Hercegovine u korist svih njenih građana. Ali, to se nije desilo i neće se desiti, zato što međunarodna zajednica već dugo zbiljski ne učestvuje u izgradnji Bosne i Hercegovine kao ozbiljne političke jedinice, već je tretira kao anarhični prostor, koji nastanjuju etnička plemena. Kada pogledamo politički profil većine naših relevantnih stranaka, možda je i razumljiva ta izdajnička platforma sa koje djeluju internacionalni birokrati, mada bi baš to trebao biti razlog da međunarodna zajednica predano radi na ispunjavanju svog mandata.

Ovako, možda je Dodikov najveći trijumf - da je izgradio politički ambijent u kojem je svaka odluka međunarodne zajednice na neki način isprazna. Mogu uvaženi članovi PIC-a [Vijeće za provedbu mira u Bosni i Hercegovini] slati prijeteće poruke, mogu čak i privesti osumnjičenog, ali bez snažnog institucionalnog mandatskog djelovanja rezultat referenduma bit će nova politička činjenica koju će vlast u RS-u snažno kapitalizirati, ne vodeći računa o mogućoj provali nasilja. Volio bih da griješim, da nas sad OHR [Ured visokog predstavnika] iznenadi nekim nevjerovatnim pristupom u korist građana Bosne i Hercegovine i u korist države kao uspješnog servisa svojih građana, ali ""daj Bože šćeri da te paša uzme"".

U slučaju da se referendum održi, pa i bez obzira na činjenicu da je neprovediv, šta će se zaista desiti na terenu?

- Mi moramo prestati upadati u zamku nekih opetovanih političkih ideja - kao odluke Ustavnog suda Bosne i Hercegovine su obavezujuće, ne trebaju se propitivati, već provoditi.... Mi zaboravljamo da živimo unutar jednog dejtonskog skeletona, u kojemu nemamo vladavinu zakona, nego vladavinu ljudi. Zakon je obesmišljen i mi imamo jedan trajno neobavezujući Ustav, imamo Ustavni sud koji nema snage svoju svrhu prostrijeti po cijeloj Bosni i Hercegovini, jer ovo nije prva odluka tog suda koja je ignorirana. Vjerovatno će se nastaviti jedna vrsta unutrašnje anarhije, neće se, naravno, ništa dramatično desiti u životima ljudi narednog jutra, ali ko zna... Pandorina kutija se zna otvoriti i bez intencionalnog subjekta. Nasilje zna poprimiti skrivalačke forme.

Mislim da je Dodik bio zatečen najavom bošnjačkih političara iz RS-a o organizaciji lokalnih referenduma i sad se, po sistemu spojenih posuda, može desiti da neki hrvatski politički faktor (potpuno je nevažno u smislu proizvođenja krize je li relevantan ili ne) odluči za, naprimjer, Posavinu, područje koje je bilo poljoprivredno razvijeno, gdje je živio vrijedni hrvatski narod, a koji je protjeran sa svojih ognjišta, zatražiti referendum, recimo o izdvajanju Dervente iz RS-a... Mi ulazimo u fazu nestabilnosti, u fazu kada se stvarna pitanja javnih politika, koja bi se trebala rješavati na najbolji zakonski način, ponovno mogla biti gurnuta ustranu, a da kao glavna isplivaju simbolička pitanja koja su kod preddemokratskih naroda i njihovih nepristojnih uskogrudih kvazielita, pitanja života i smrti. U takvom ambijentu nestabilnost i nepovjerenje se povećavaju. Zato plediram da međunarodna zajednica, ako joj je stalo da se dostignuti stepen mira održi i poveća, osnaži mirovne snage u Bosni i Hercegovini.

Može li se desiti da se odluke referenduma provedu, odnosno da takav jedan presedan postane pravilo, pa onda ovakav jedan 'mali' referendum postane legalna platforma za organiziranje nekog većeg, naprimjer onog za izdvajanje RS-a iz Bosne i Hercegovine?

- Sa stanovišta unutrašnjeg političkog života u RS-u, taj referendum generalno neće ništa promijeniti, jer se taj dan ionako slavi kao Dan RS-a. Ovo je samo jedna vrsta pokušaja premoćne političke verifikacije toga što već imamo, ali moramo razmišljati o implikacijama toga, da je to neminovno nova punktna tačka, od koje, na snažnoj homogenizirajućoj nacionalnoj osnovi, počinju slijedeći procesi umaranja Bosne i Hercegovine, s ciljem da se država ogadi dovoljnoj većini kako bi konačno iskliznula iz historije. Ja vjerujem da su sljedeće faze te politike, prije secesije, dugotrajno usmjerene na daljnje obesmišljavanje bilo kakve političke svrhe na državnom nivou. Znači da je ključna tendencija zbiljsko prodavanje ideje kako je Bosna i Hercegovina samo i samo mehanički zbir dva entiteta, da Bosna i Hercegovina nikad nije bila prije dejtonske Bosne i Hercegovine i da sada samo voljom dva asimetrična entiteta ona nastavlja živjeti.

Nažalost, Mehanizam koordinacije je potvrda tog entitetsko-kantonalnog ključa i ja se s punim prezirom odnosim prema svim onim politikama u Bosni i Hercegovini, ma kako one sebe nominalno zvale, a koje su pristale na ovakvu nedostojnu imaginaciju države kao što je Mehanizam koordinacije, koji je ispraznio državu od bilo kakve državne supstance, više nego što je to ovaj referendum koji je najavljen u RS-u.

Mehanizmom koordinacije svaki dio teritorije BiH proglašen je državom i sad imate situaciju u kojoj se Mehanizam koordinacije u potpunosti čita s idejama organiziranja raznih referenduma. Jer, zaboga, budimo ironični u svojoj nemoći, ako 194 čovjeka trebaju konsenzusom donijeti odluku o projektu evropske podrške sadnicama šljiva u Laktašima, kako to da drugačije tumače entiteti, općine i drugi nivoi vlasti nego da su države, barem u dejtonskom smislu te riječi. Ono što se zaboravlja u analizi političkog prezenta je spora promjena ideje moći, trijumf regresivnih ideja, pa iako je teško to prihvatiti, mi smo svjedoci pobjede feudalnih političkih ideja uređenja države na svim našim stranama. U ovom trenutku vi imate na desetine lokalnih političara feudalaca koji kad kažu država misle na svoj travnički, zenički, banjalučki, zapadnohercegovački, sarajevski... feud. To su, također, raščaravajuće implikacije ovog referenduma.

Ko je najveći krivac što se ideja o referendumu nije sasjekla u korijenu?

- Ja mislim da je krivo odsustvo integrirajućeg bh. političkog faktora. Dakle, da se ne lažemo, nema nikakve sumnje da je politički koncept stranaka koje se zovu probosanske, uglavnom etnonacionalni, redukcionističko-teritorijalni i da stvarna autentična ideja koja objedinjuje sve građane Bosne i Hercegovine ne postoji. I kada postoji, ona biva zgažena logikom dejtonske države, koja je porazila, primjera radi, bosanskohercegovačku ljevicu. To je glavni razlog što su svi politički akteri, zbog kalkulacija, unaprijed i stvarno (zanemarimo mimikriju), odustali od ideje da je moguć bilo kakav integrativni bh. koncept. Pa, ako unaprijed od toga odustanete, naravno da se ništa od integracija neće ni desiti.

Zamislite da ste već od 1995. godine imali stranku koja je bez ikakvih kalkulacija insistirala na ideji koja je s onu stranu bilo kakve dejtonske paradigme, koja je naprosto bazirana na drugačijem načinu političkog oblikovanja i da je 20 godina odbijala da uđe u vlast - tako bi stvorila neku kritičku antidejtonsku, građansku biračku volju da se stanje mijenja. Ali, to više nije moguće, jer se svaka takva ideja sada proglašava bošnjačkom i i unitarističkom, a takvoj atmosferi su doprinijele bošnjačke političke stranke, koje su od političkog građanstva udaljene baš onoliko koliko ga javno zagovaraju, dakle, ne mogu se sresti ni u putu. Tu prepoznajem jednu od ključnih remetilačkih tačaka našeg zajedničkog bh. neuspjeha. Druga je nacionalistička Srbija, koja je, ustvari, pravi remetilački faktor, trajna nemogućnost da Bosna i Hercegovina bude.

Znate, izaziva gađenje ova perverzna proizvodnja Aleksandra Vučića mirovnjakom, ova prodaja mirovne magle koju premijer Srbije pušta po regionu, pri čemu se zanemaruje očigledna nacionalistička strategija skovana u obavještajno-diplomatskoj mreži - hajdemo mi proglasiti sebe mirovnjacima tako što ćemo zaustaviti suočavanje s prošlošću, nastaviti kulturu poricanja, a od Aleksandra ćemo napraviti Ghandija. I vidimo da je svijet to popušio, da je Srbija to popušila, da zvanični Beograd vrvi od mirovne kulture koja ne priznaje genocid, masovne zločine, trice i kučine u nekoj tamo Bosni... Prema meni je Srbija i dalje glavni remetilački faktor, jer RS tretira kao ratni plijen. Treći faktor je međunarodna zajednica. Naravno, ima tu i drugih faktora, i Hrvatska ima svoju, uzročno-posljedično, inkriminirajuću ulogu, kao i regresivni i nazadni politički islam.

Hoće li reagirati visoki predstavnik, odnosno PIC, kojem je glavni zadatak provedba mirovnog procesa u Bosni i Hercegovini?

- [Visoki predstabnik Valentin] Inzko je jedna onemoćala samo i samo retorička figura. Najviše što bi on mogao uraditi je da, budući da, kao kulturan čovjek, voli obilaziti izložbe, organizira i neku izložbu o ovom referendumu. Naprosto, to je neki njegov maksimum, politička instalacija. Naravno, za tu nemoć, prije svega, kriv je Zapad. Zašto? Rusija je u vremenu Jelcina [Borisa, bivšeg predsjednika Ruske Federacije] i Kozirjeva [Andreja, bivšeg ministra vanjskih poslova Ruske Federacije] naprosto bila odani dio međunarodne zajednice u smislu njene pozitivne uloge u Bosni i Hercegovini. Konsenzusom su prolazile sve ključne ideje. To je bilo vrijeme u kojem je međunarodna zajednica mogla uraditi sve ono što sada ne može, ali nije radila. Dakle, ono što joj je mandat - ojačavanje države, jasno tumačenje Daytona, ne kao slova, kako to kaže Dodik, nego duha, jer je intencija Daytona da on bude promijenjen radi izgradnje samoodržive političke zajednice... i ništa se po tom pitanju nije relevantno radilo. Donesene su mnoge bitne odluke, koje su bez ikakvog otpora usvojene, a to nam govori da su mnogo krupnije odluke mogle biti donesene. A sada godinama imamo situaciju da Rusija naprosto to blokira.

Sad, opet s malo ironije, imate situaciju da su brat [predsjednik Turske Recep Tayyip] Erdogan i brat [predsjednik Rusije Vladimir] Putin postali veliki ahbabi. Baš me čudi da se prijateljske relacije između zvaničnog Sarajeva i zvanične Ankare ne mogu iskoristiti da se Putinov utjecaj u RS-u iskoristi tako da ne dođe do referenduma. Objektivno, Inzko teško da može šta pametno uraditi. On je sada više glasnogovornik nego donositelj odluka. On hoće nekako reagirati, ali više kroz korištenje mreže osobnih veza, kako bi velike internacionalne ribe izvršile pritisak na Vučića i Dodika da eventualno ne dođe do referenduma. Ali, to je samo gašenje vatre. Ne može Bosna i Hercegovina tako funkcionirati do vječnosti, to nije ništa.

Kako onda Bosna i Hercegovina može izaći iz ove krize?

- Smatram da, kao što sam već rekao, ponovo treba ojačati mirovne snage u Bosni i Hercegovini. To je za Evropsku uniju jedna vrsta dara s neba, da pokaže da može upravljati eventualnim krizama u Evropi, da pošalje poruku da joj je stalo do mira i stabilnosti, da neće dozvoliti obnovu nasilja, da shvata ovakve ideje poput referenduma, pa ma kako se one benigno predstavljale, kao prijetnju miru i stabilnosti. I, na kraju, to bi bilo ponovo jedna poruka političkim elitama - okanite se ćorava posla, mi nećemo dozvoliti da se Bosna i Hercegovina raspadne.

Ali, opet se bojim da od toga nema ništa. Problem s nasiljem je što on može izbiti kada vi i ne vidite da su se inducirali potrebni elementi za to. Nasilje može izbiti neočekivano i onda ga je vrlo teško zaustaviti. Sada, ako to međunarodna zajednica nema u vidu, onda ne smijemo odustati od one interpretacije da bi, zbog narasle protivrječnosti u Bosni i Hercegovini, nekim faktorima koji razmišljaju samo na nivou realističke politike, možda bilo najlakše da konačno neko pobijedi u Bosni i Hercegovini.

Ja se duboko grozim takvog razmišljanja, koje ima svoje suflere i u međunarodnoj zajednici i na domaćoj sceni, i da neće doći do stvaranja uvjeta koji će dovesti do izbijanja nasilja i zaustavljanja pionirskih procesa pomirenja i izgradnje povjerenja u Bosni i Hercegovini.

Kada ste spomenuli neiskorištene prilike s Ankarom, i inače zbližavanje Turske i Rusije, kad se to desilo, u šali sam rekla: 'E, sada će se i Bošnjaci pomiriti sa Srbima...'

- Vidite, to što ste rekli kao šalu, to u nekim geostrateškim tumačenjima uopće nije šala, jer mi prisustvujemo jednoj velikoj bici za duše - da li će region zapadnog Balkana postati dio zapadne civilizacije, ili dio pravoslavno-islamske civilizacije.

Koliko je sve veći utjecaj Rusije na Balkanu prijetnja za proevropske i proatlantske tendencije Bosne i Hercegovine?

- To je ono što se potcjenjuje, to Zapad, sa svojim normativističkim, institucionalističkim pristupom krizi, ne vidi baš kao veliku opasnost. Nedavno je kineski predsjednik poslao poruku o kinesko-ruskom savezništvu, dakle, moguća je jedna nova geopolitička šahovska tabla, u kojoj mi, kao mali i nebitni, ali koji smo skloni proizvodnji kriza, možemo biti ta neka vrsta pijuna koji će se žrtvovati. Na koji način?

Ja mislim da je u interesu svih građana Bosne i Hercegovine da ona postane dio zapadnog transatlantskog svijeta, svijeta procedura i zakonitosti, a ne svijeta orijentalnih despotija... Ono što ja nisam siguran - nisam siguran u ketmensku poziciju bh. političara, čije javno zagovaranje eurointegracija ne mora značiti iskrenu favorizaciju, to me zabrinjava. Ako imate jednu politiku koja pravi potpuno iracionalnu ovisnost od Ankare, koja de facto nekim čudnim porukama denacionalizira bošnjačku nacionalnu vertikalu kroz historiju, nisam siguran, kada bi Moskva i Ankara donijele odluku o utemeljenju velikog, novog, snažnog savezništva, da tu ideju na mikroplanu ne bi prigrlili neki bošnjački i srpski političari. Znate, to je lakši svijet - nema baš teških procedura, nema zakonitosti, nema ispunjavanja tehničkih uvjeta, kao što insistira dosadni Brisel, čemu transparentnost i tako to. Nemojte potcjenjivati ovo što sam rekao, čak mislim da u pozadini mnogih otpora europeizaciji Bosne i Hercegovine stoji upravo ovo.

Šta će se desiti nakon 25. septembra, kada je zakazan referendum u RS-u?

- Ja ne bih potcijenio ozbiljne negativne posljedice. Politički akteri u Bosni i Hercegovini su inducirali mržnju - ja hodam po cijeloj Bosni i Hercegovini i držim radionice o pomirenju, od Nevesinja do Krajine, i vidim koliko ima sjajnih malih ljudi kojima je puna kapa ove političke retorike koja samo zaziva nasilje, ali ogroman je broj ljudi kojima je u interesu obnova nasilja. Znate ko su najveći inicijatori nasilja? Pa ovi koji organiziraju referendum, a govore: ""Pa što se digla tolika prašina, pa to je ništa, to je jedno izjašnjavanje građana kao izraz najšire demokratske volje...""

Upravo su ti ljudi, iza te svoje navodne benigne, pacifističke interpretacije referenduma, najopasniji. Ta jedna vrsta prikrivenog nasilja, to je najopasnije. Opasno je čak i u onoj mjeri u kojoj [premijerka RS-a] Željka Cvijanović vjeruje da je ""dizanje frke"" nepotrebno, da referendum ne može proizvesti ništa loše. Eto, takve izjave su generatori jednog nasilja koje čuči iza scene, to je nešto što naprosto treba razotkriti. Ako ti ljudi tako misle, ako nisu svjesni te opasnosti, onda se igraju vatrom. Ako misle da je to moguće da se završi na nivou da Dodik prevari opoziciju i na lokalnim izborima dobije puno više nego što je očekivao, da će to biti konačni doseg referenduma i ništa drugo, ja u to ne vjerujem.

Kada govorite o radionicama o učenju demokratiji - nije li nonsens da mi, koji smo živjeli u bivšoj Jugoslaviji, a koja je bila primjer svijetu po pitanju suživota, sada o tome učimo na radionicama, dolaze nam strane organizacije da to propagiraju?

- Bivša Jugoslavija je bila ozbiljna mirovna zajednica. Jugoslavija je odmah nakon rata započela velike mirovne geste, kao što su, naprimjer, omladinske radne akcije. To je bila velika i dugotrajna mirovna gesta. Ovdje su izostale simboličke geste velikog pomirenja, jer nacionalnim strankama do toga uopće nije bilo stalo. Međunarodna zajednica je napravila veliku grešku zato što procese pomirenja nije postavila kao svoje ključne strategije odmah nakon rata. Ne, ključno je bilo modernizirati glavne aktere rata, napraviti od njih pristojne političke strukture i evo šta imamo - vječito vraćanje istog. Negativno istog.

Zato što je izostala autentična podrška zbijskom pomirenju, mi smo sada u situaciji da snagom, umijećem i voljom pojedinaca, civilnog društva, nevladinih organizacija, teologa i vjerskih službenika odanih izgradnji povjerenja i pomirenju, ali opet uz podršku nekih međunarodnih faktora, radimo na procesu pomirenja. Gdje je najveća greška? Najveća greška je što ljudi ne shvataju da je proces pomirenja najteži mirovni poduhvat - vi ljude morate motivirati na odgovornu kulturu sjećanja i da zaborave na kulturu poricanja. A mi 20 godina gradimo navodno mir na kulturi poricanja. Pa ne može se tako graditi mir. Recimo, to radi Vučić. Znači, stvarna izgradnja pomirenja zahtijeva da se ljudi suoče sa svojim demonima, da se suoče s tim šta se desilo, da pokušate ljudima koji poriču genocid i ratne zločine, koji poriču ubistva naroda, odgovorno posredovati istinu, ali na način da ti ljudi to prihvataju, a ne da proizvodite još veći jaz među ljudima. A uglavnom u pričama o pomirenju koji tobože preferiraju političari, samo se prave novi jazovi.

Evo primjera: prije nešto više od dvije godine Predsjedništvo Bosne i Hercegovine je s Ujedinjenim narodima usvojilo deklaraciju Dijalog za budućnost. To je neočekivana mirovna gesta Predsjedništva, kojom ono ohrabruje procese pomirenja, da mladi, obrazovanje, kultura... postanu platforme putem kojih će se ljudi bolje upoznavati, putem kojih će uspostavljati dijalog, zbiljski razgovor i raditi na iskrenom pomirenju. To je gesta koju treba podržati.

Novinari su pokazali apsolutnu nezainteresiranost za to, čak i mnogi ne znaju za tu deklaraciju, ali zato su potpune marginalije (naprimjer politički iftari, večere i slično) udarne vijesti. Dalje, sami akteri te deklaracije, članovi Predsjedništva, u svom javnom djelovanju ne rade ono što bi trebali - oni nisu ""spustili"" tu deklaraciju u svoje stranke, pa tako neki načelnici općina, a koji dolaze iz stranaka članova Predsjedništva države, nisu htjeli svoje općine uključiti u procese pomirenja. Ne može se pomirenje tako graditi, niti upirati prstom uvijek na drugog, da je odgovornost na drugoj strani, a vi razvijati, primjera radi, jednu opaku retradicionalizaciju u Bosni i Hercegovini koja nas želi vratiti u neko vrijeme u kojem, Snježana, imajući u vidu vaš spol, mi ne bismo mogli uopće voditi ovaj razgovor.

Over the past two years, as Republicans have obstructed progress in Congress, the White House has issued a raft of executive orders — raising wages and establishing paid sick leave for federal employees and contract workers, barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for contractors and raising overtime pay for 5 million white-collar workers. Also, he has sharpened his tone on the need for employee collective action to improve wages and working conditions. “The middle class itself was built on a union label,” he said in September at the White House Summit for Worker Voice, adding, “as union membership has fallen, inequality has risen.” Unfortunately, Obama’s conversion may be a case of too little, too late. And this is part of a pattern. Consistently, when Democratic presidents have come into office, they have placed workers’ rights low on their list of priorities — even when their electoral success owed much to the efforts of organized labor. This neglect has resulted in a situation in which U.S. labor law has become hopelessly outdated, employer abuses are rampant and the middle class has crumbled alongside declining union membership. As the 2016 election cycle heats up, are any candidates willing to break this trend? Rather than treat workers’ rights as an afterthought, could the next Democratic president make it a real priority once in office?

A pattern of neglect

Democratic leaders have consistently failed to spend any serious political capital defending the right to organize. Certainly this was true in the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson had the opportunity to roll back the proliferation of so-called right-to-work laws that undermined unions, especially in the South, by allowing workers to gain the benefits of union membership without paying their fair share of membership dues. In the 1964 elections and their aftermath, the AFL-CIO was a major organizational force behind the Johnson administration. Moreover, conditions on Capitol Hill were favorable. “For a generation, there had been no Congress as friendly to labor as the 89th,” wrote the historian Irving Bernstein. Despite all this, Johnson delayed acting on labor law reform until the business lobby and Southern Democrats had successfully organized a filibuster. As political scientist Taylor Dark put it, “Johnson also seemed reluctant to use his famous powers of persuasion very forcefully.” Ultimately, the project of reforming labor law and outlawing right to work failed, and Johnson ignominiously left office without shoring up the right to organize. In 1977, Jimmy Carter made similar overtures to organized labor but also failed to deliver. That year, the House of Representatives passed the Labor Law Reform Act, designed to speed up union elections and penalize companies that broke labor law. Yet his support for the measure was lukewarm, and he ultimately put labor’s goals on the back burner. AFL-CIO President George Meany “asked Carter to schedule labor law as his first priority for the 1978 congressional session,” wrote historian Judith Stein. “The president, however, wanted to begin the Senate session with the controversial Panama Canal Treaty … Carter insisted, and the lengthy debates on the treaty gave business time to mobilize against labor reform.” Although a labor-law proposal passed the House 257-163, it died in another Senate filibuster.

Absent a shift in the balance of power in US workplaces, the gains from productivity increases in our economy will continue going to the wealthiest 1 percent rather than to the vast majority.

In 1992, Bill Clinton vowed on the campaign trail to ban the replacement of striking workers, a major union goal. Once in office, however, he failed to take serious action. He delegated labor law reform to a commission chaired by John Dunlop, a labor secretary under Richard Nixon. Even though Democrats held majorities in both houses of Congress, the Clinton administration failed to leverage the momentum his campaign gained from working people to modernize labor law. True to the biases of the emergent New Democrats, Clinton appeared more concerned with the interests of Big Business than with workers’ rights. As journalist Louis Uchitelle explained in his 2006 book “The Disposable American,” each attempt by labor activists to push forward legal reforms “ran up against concern at the White House that the nation’s corporate executives would be angered at the intrusion on their autonomy and, in retaliation, would inflict political damage. So the administration backed off.”

As the largest country in the Middle East, it has a young and well-educated population, as well as the capacity to pursue a serious international agenda.

With only a few days remaining to negotiate an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, focus is shifting to the potential impact of the deal on regional security. A nuclear deal could open the doors to sustained, tactical cooperation between the West and Iran — a real necessity in an otherwise crumbling region.

So is Iran the West’s next partner in the region?

Doubtful. No one is ready to call Iran a friend. And despite Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s apparent change of tone, no hardliner in Iran is ready for a serious rapprochement with the Great Satan, either.

Nevertheless, a deal opens the door to a number of things. For better or worse, meaningful dialogue with Iran is predicated on resolving the nuclear issue. All other problems have taken a back seat over the past two decades. A deal makes sustained engagement of Iran a possibility. It presents an opportunity to moderate Iran’s three decades of hostility towards the West. And it makes it possible to draw Iran into an effort to stabilize the Middle East. In a region characterized by chaos, strong states that aren’t systematically opposed to Western policies are welcome.

What’s more, a deal will empower President Hassan Rouhani’s administration. Today, the foreign ministry makes few foreign policy decisions; the most important ones, including those about Syria and Iraq, are largely within the remit of Iran’s revolutionary guards. A nuclear agreement would give Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif the political capital to gradually takeover these files, and lend credence to the team that actively seek engagement with the rest of the region. After all, Foreign Minister Zarif continues his overtures to Saudi Arabia, despite domestic hardliner opposition.

There is no doubt that a strong, liberal and independent Iran will naturally pursue its own interests, and these may not always align with the West’s. But Tehran is more likely to be sympathetic to Western goals if it develops ties with the European Union and the United States. There is no shortage of common goals: From combating extremism to stopping the drug trade by ensuring a stable government in Afghanistan, Iran and the West have their work cut out for them.

At present, nothing is more pressing to both sides than defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Iran is more committed to Iraq than any other regional player, and ISIL can’t be defeated with U.S.-led airstrikes alone. The coalition needs local and regional support, and with a deal, greater coordination between all sides becomes diplomatically acceptable."

But there are also two nations of food when it comes to what the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and other advocates call “first food,” or breast milk. In one, women are supported to nurse — by their hospitals, workplaces and communities. In the other, it’s exceedingly hard for women to do so. But there doesn’t have to be such a divide.

The benefits of breastfeeding—and the risks of not doing so—are now well documented. According to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, “Breast milk is widely acknowledged as the most complete form of nutrition for infants, with a range of benefits for infants’ health, growth, immunity and development.” Breastfeeding also lowers the risk of breast cancer for mom, and provides a free source of nutritious food. As the World Health Organization states: “Exclusive breastfeeding reduces infant mortality due to common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea or pneumonia, and helps for a quicker recovery during illness.”

The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months followed by continued breastfeeding “along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.” That’s the ideal. But in the United States, that’s not the reality for most babies. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show that last year, only 43 percent of infants were exclusively breastfed at three months, and just 22 percent exclusively through 6 months. The rates vary along race and class lines: Though the gap between black and white breastfeeding initiation rates has narrowed, it was still 16 percentage points in 2008.

Breastfeeding advocate Kimberly Seals Allers, whose forthcoming book “The Big Let Down” analyzes the social, economic and political influences of breastfeeding culture, focuses on the phenomenon of “first food deserts” — the idea, as she explained by email, “that place matters. There are many places across the country lacking access to the resources and the culture for babies to receive their most nutritional food: breast milk.” Passing policies to regulate baby feeding companies, promoting educational campaigns and changing workplace norms would help reduce the prevalence of these “first food deserts” and narrow the gap on breastfeeding rates along race and class lines.

Improving the rates for breastfeeding is particularly hampered because we still have no federal policy for maternity leave in the United States. No one should be shocked that it’s challenging for mothers to exclusively breastfeed their babies when 1 in 4 of them return to work within two weeks of childbirth, as an In These Times report by journalist Sharon Lerner found. Plus, many women return to workplaces hostile to breastfeeding: few or no breaks allowed for pumping, for instance, and no clean, comfortable place provided to do so. (Moms I know like to trade snapshots of the most ridiculous place they’ve pumped: Bathroom floors and janitor closets top the list.)

Another important factor is the lack of essential support. The CDC reports that without hospital support, 1 in 3 mothers stop breastfeeding. I know first-hand, because I’m one of those moms who needed help — a lot of it. When my first daughter was born, I came home from the hospital with naïve confidence in my breastfeeding capabilities, confidence that quickly turned into desperation. My daughter couldn’t get her latch right; to relieve the searing pain, I tried everything from frozen cabbage leaves to soaked tea bags, but nothing helped. Combined with sleep deprivation and a bout of mastitis, those first weeks were tough. Thankfully, I didn’t have to return to work right away and could afford to pay a private lactation consultant. Even with this support, it was hard; I almost gave up. But I persevered and after a few weeks, my daughter and I got the hang of it. For the next 12 months I had an easy, free source of healthy food for my child. How many women are this fortunate? Too few."

The event happens seven months before the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. As a longtime Iowan, I can say the fair is good fun. But the candidates go there mostly to pander to Iowa’s powerful agribusiness interests.

Iowa is the largest corn producer in the United States, and more than 90 percent of gasoline sold in the U.S. contains ethanol. The state’s agribusinesses benefits from the renewable fuel standard, a 2007 law that requires gasoline producers to blend ethanol, which is almost always distilled from corn, to their product. The caucuses embody the power of grass-roots politics, but the influence of the ethanol lobby shows how corporate interests can undercut democracy.

Iowans will hold caucuses on Feb. 6 to choose their presidential candidates. According to a new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll, 77 percent of Democratic likely caucusgoers surveyed said they support the renewable fuel standard, as did 61 percent of Republican ones.

As world leaders noted during the high-stakes climate conference in Paris last month, global warming remains a crucial challenge, but ethanol is a poor way of reducing greenhouse gases. Mandating smaller, more efficient motor vehicles and better public transportation would reduce fossil fuel consumption far more effectively.

In Iowa artificially inflated corn prices and revenue, enhanced by government mandates, continue to encourage producers to plant it from fencerow to fencerow. This increasingly common practice has reduced wetlands and grasslands that could soak up water and reduce the risk of flooding. Partly as a result, Iowans and others around the Midwest have faced unprecedented floods over the last 20 years.

Yet ethanol mandate advocates portray it as an environmentally sound, renewable fuel, although its long-term use actually threatens the environment. Iowa has lost a considerable amount of nonrenewable topsoil to corn production. Some areas in Iowa have about half the fertile soil as they did when farmers began plowing in the 1840s. The emphasis on corn has increased the use of cancer-causing nitrate fertilizers and pesticides. The chemicals run off the land and endanger drinking water and flow down the Mississippi River. Fertilizers have produced a growing dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, almost devoid of life, affecting the livelihoods of fishermen.

Many processed foods in the U.S. contain corn or corn syrup. In 2014 the U.S. Department of Agriculture classified 14 percent of American households as food insecure. With so many Americans facing hunger and even more suffering abroad, using corn to power cars is horrible idea.

Subsidized corn ethanol benefits a privileged few. The price of Iowa farmland remains prohibitively expensive, nearly $7,000 an acre, making diversified family farms less and less viable. Someone other than the owner, such as employees or tenants, farms more than half the state’s agricultural land. And those who live outside the state own 20 percent of Iowa’s farmland.

Farmers rely on petroleum-based fertilizers, huge diesel tractors and combines and long-distance trucking between farms and markets. As food-security activist and writer Andy Fisher said recently, today’s intensive agriculture is a process of “turning oil into food.” And after using fossil fuels to produce corn, ethanol production entails using more energy to turn corn into fuel."

In taking up the mantle of decriminalization, Amnesty International has correctly concluded that forcing them to ply their trade on the black market is an aggravating factor that can and must be eliminated.

As the name suggests, harm reduction is not a panacea for completely sanitizing potentially risky behavior of negative consequences. Instead the goal is to limit the most severe and acute side effects of behavior by removing aggravating factors that perpetuate them.

The policy paper also states that the new framework should not be considered “in isolation from Amnesty International’s existing human rights policies and positions;” the group says it will continue to demand that states address overarching issues such as “gender equality, violence against women, non-discrimination, human trafficking, [and] sexual and reproductive rights” and will hold them to account where they fail to do so.

Amnesty’s platform is grounded in the philosophy of harm reduction and calls for removing all criminal sanctions that restrict the commercial exchange of sex between consenting adults. This would include not only sex workers themselves, but those who purchase sexual services or facilitate their exchange. Trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation would still be criminalized under international law, as would commercialized sexual acts involving children.

In the months leading up to the contentious decision many prominent voices — including celebrities such as Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep and Lena Dunham — spoke out against the proposal, questioning why a group with a global mandate to promote universal human rights would legitimize an institution they view as incompatible with that goal.

On Aug. 11, Amnesty International took the courageous step of breaking with many of its longtime supporters to adopt a new policy position calling for the decriminalization of sex work around the world.

A growing movement

There is also convincing evidence that removing legal restrictions on the sex trade improves working conditions and greatly lowers the risk of disease for those who depend on it for survival.

This position has also been advanced by Human Rights Watch and the World Health Organization, which said prohibition “creates a climate of impunity for crimes against sex workers” and increases their vulnerability to violence. This kind of impunity is a hallmark of all black markets.

The notion that removing the legal prohibitions on commercial sex will make life better for sex workers is hardly revolutionary. Nearly a decade ago the International Labor Organization (ILO) — the official labor agency of the United Nations — called for the formal economic recognition of the sex industry, including extending labor rights and benefits to sex workers. In 2012 the UN-backed Global Commission on HIV and the Law recommended repealing all laws prohibiting “adult consensual sex work” on the grounds that criminalization exacerbates the risks associated with the trade.

Decriminalization may not be able to shine a light into every dark corner of the sex industry, but it can brighten the prospects of millions of people now working in the shadows.

So why all the controversy?

The opposition to decriminalizing sex work is varied in nature and approach, but for the most part the arguments are rooted in two wobbly presumptions: that the buying and selling of sex can never be a legitimate economic exchange, and that the harm-reduction aspects of universal decriminalization are being oversold.

The first position is held by decriminalization opponents such as Justice For Women founder Julie Bindel, who views prostitution itself as “a vile industry.” It was echoed in a Change.org petition opposing the Amnesty draft proposal circulated by the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) that calls prostitution “a harmful practice steeped in gender and economic inequalities” and “predicated on dehumanization, degradation and gender violence.”

Harm reduction is a hard sell for absolutists who think this way. Much like anti-choice campaigners in the United States, who equate terminating a pregnancy under any condition with murder, supporters of CATW’s petition are so morally resolute in their a priori opposition to sex work that, as one sex worker recently put it, “my not existing is more important to them than my safety.”

A small number of these opponents are likely sexual puritans who object to prostitution on religious or moralistic grounds. But for the most part their argument rests on the belief that the sex industry is an exploitative institution based on the objectification of the human body.

I’m willing to concede they are right, up to a point, but they fail to see the larger significance of their argument. As long as there is inequality in society there will be some level of inequity in the labor market. The very act of selling one’s labor, whatever it happens to be, implies objectification. And though it may shock my libertarian friends to hear it, exploitation is a basic, pernicious characteristic of capitalism, one that is greatly amplified when allowed to operate in the shadows.

To oppose prostitution on principle requires either opposition to free-marketism itself on the grounds that exchanging bodily labor for money is always dehumanizing, or — as is reflected in opposition language that refers to sex workers as “prostituted individuals” — a recognition that there is something inherently different about sexual anatomy that supersedes our autonomy to employ it as a salable asset. The message here is clear: Putting one’s hands to work for another person in exchange for a paycheck is legitimate so long as they are wrapped around a mop handle and not a penis. This line of thinking is not only incompatible with the progressive view of sexuality espoused by many of Amnesty’s critics, but it undermines the very concept of human rights, which supports the freedom of each of us to self-determination over our bodies even when others don’t agree with our choices.

A second opposition camp is more concerned with the collateral consequences of decriminalization, which they say will include an increase in human trafficking. The data on this claim is unreliable, and depends on how one defines “trafficking.” But there is some evidence that countries that lift criminal restrictions on the sex trade do experience an influx of both legal and illegal immigrants to work in the industry. While there is no doubt some of them are trafficked against their will, there’s reason to believe it’s a relatively small percentage in places where sex work is legal.

For instance, a report from the government of New Zealand, which decriminalized prostitution in 2003, found that less than four percent of sex workers reported being coerced into the industry.

In any case, forcing someone into slavery, for any reason, is always a violation of human rights and there is nothing about Amnesty International’s new policy statement that is inconsistent with that truth. But so too is subjecting an entire class of workers to unnecessary risk by criminalizing their means of survival.

As the great Indian philosopher Amartya Sen has observed, the advancement of human rights is not a zero-sum game, it is a mission of increments. Decriminalization may not be able to shine a light into every dark corner of the sex industry, but it can brighten the prospects of millions of people now working in the shadows."

I suppose this case for a Fed rate hike can be taken as a modification of President Barack Obama’s famous campaign slogan, “Yes we can,” but it is not exactly an impressive argument.

Then Fed Vice-chair Stanley Fisher argued that we should raise interest rates so that we can lower them if the economy falls into a recession. Since the key question is the current strength of the labor market and the economy, Fisher was effectively saying that we should deliberately weaken the economy now with higher interest rates, so that if some unseen event weakens the economy in the future, we will be able to respond with lower interest rates. That doesn’t sound very persuasive.

The stock market is also somewhat high, but considerably lower after China fears knocked 10 percent off the values of the major indexes. Here too we can point to some tech companies such as Uber whose stock seems clearly over-valued, but do we want the whole country to suffer to provide a lesson to some Silicon Valley venture capitalists and their followers?

House prices are high compared to their historic trend, but certainly well below their bubble peak on an inflation-adjusted basis. Cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles are arguably seeing housing bubbles, but it would be rather bizarre to slow the nation’s economy in order to bring down house prices in a few cities where the housing market has gone a bit frothy.

If the threat of inflation isn’t adequate for selling an interest-rate hike, the next move was the need to have higher rates to attack bubbles. The big problem with this story is that it is not clear that we have any bubbles, nor is it obvious that hiking interest rates is the best way to address them if we did.

The original rationale for higher interest rates was the need to stop inflation. We have had people harping on the risk of hyper-inflation since 2009. Inflation has remained stubbornly low these last six years, consistently remaining under the Fed’s 2.0 percent target. If anything, the recent trend has been downward as a result of the collapse of the price of oil and other commodities.

The drumbeat for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board seems to be unstoppable. When the data seem to undermine one argument for a hike, the rate hike advocates simply change course.

The main reason the Fed should not raise rates is that it absurd to have the government acting to deliberately keep people from getting jobs.

While the proponents of rate hikes have been dancing around with their rationale of the day, the opponents of Fed rate hikes have been sticking with their stodgy line about not raising rates unnecessarily. They have made the point that the Fed should not be deliberately slowing the economy and keeping people from getting jobs in the absence of any serious inflationary threat. In fact, with inflation stuck well below the Fed’s target, there is a good argument that the Fed should be taking steps to boost the inflation rate.

But with proponents of rate hikes constantly changing their rhetoric, perhaps it’s time for opponents to offer a new reason as well. So here’s an argument against rate hikes to make all of those deficit hawks out there happy: Lower interest rates and higher employment will mean more tax revenue, less money paid out for unemployment insurance and other transfers, and therefore lower deficits. If we can sustain an unemployment rate that is 1.0 percentage point lower than the current 5.1 percent level, it could easily reduce the budget deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next decade.

Low unemployment, not tax increases or spending cuts, was the main cause of our budget surpluses in the last years of the Clinton administration. If the Alan Greenspan Fed had followed the consensus within the mainstream of the economics profession and kept the unemployment rate from falling below 6.0 percent, we would have been looking at a budget deficit of around $250 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) instead of a surplus of roughly the same amount.

In fact, rather than worrying about deficits, people in the low unemployment environment of 2000-2001 were worrying about what to do with the surplus. Alan Greenspan actually testified in support of President Bush’s tax cut as a way to avoid paying off the debt too quickly.

So another reason that the Fed shouldn’t raise interest rates is to keep the deficit and debt down. This should rally all of these Peter Peterson fiscal conservative deficit hawks. After all, don’t they care about the debt burden they are passing on to our children and grandchildren? What about that debt clock that is now ticking up near $18.4 trillion? Do they have a better way to reduce the deficit by a $1 trillion over the next decade?

Of course, these concerns about the debt are silly. Our children’s well-being is going to be determined by the strength of the economy that we hand down to them: the capital stock, the physical and natural infrastructure, the development of technology, and the education of the workforce — not sheets of paper (i.e. government bonds). But it is curious why the people who obsess over the deficit never seem to concern themselves with Fed policy which has a large and direct effect on the deficit.

At any rate, the main reason the Fed should not raise rates is that it absurd to have the government acting to deliberately keep people from getting jobs. The policy is especially pernicious since we know the victims of a rate hike will disproportionately be minorities and less-educated workers. But if we need an additional reason, we can always start yelling about deficits."

Sadly, our elected leaders failed to do much to take advantage of opportunities to build a widely prosperous future.

Let’s take a look at where America’s leaders could do better in 2016.

Our economy suffers because we neglect investment in commonwealth goods and services, the foundation on which private wealth is built. Government investments are, and always have been, crucial to economic prosperity. Yet starving our public sector has become widely accepted policy.

Net public investment per capita at all levels of government, excluding the military, is slipping. The total invested is down to about a half of one percent of our economy. That means our roads, bridges, public buildings, equipment and software are wearing out as fast as we maintain them. There have been almost no net additions to our commonwealth in this century.

By 2020 we need to invest at least $3.6 trillion — roughly one year of federal spending — just to make our infrastructure safe and reliable, the American Society of Civil Engineers calculates.

Our research into understanding and mastering the universe, from making more efficient engines to more complex algorithms, is what enables economic growth. But for taxpayers in the last century spending money to develop jet engines and pressurized fuselages, we would not enjoy jet travel. But for government-funded research in mathematics, exotic materials and computer science, we would not have our cell phones or the Internet.

Yet federal spending on research and development, excluding the military, has been virtually unchanged in this century at about $66 billion per year. The only growth has been in military R&D, up 37 percent in real terms since 2000 to $75.7 billion this fiscal year.

This paucity of government investment is not uniquely American. The World Economic Forum estimates that human beings invest $2.7 trillion annually in energy, telecommunications, mass transit and water systems. Big as that number is it is less than two-thirds of what is needed for safety and efficient commerce, falling short by $1 trillion a year.

Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last year that “we need higher investment today for stronger growth tomorrow,” noting that private investment had not made up for cuts in public investment.

Our most valuable asset, though, is not physical structures such as roads, dams and sewers. Our most valuable asset is the gray matter between young ears, into which we must invest more if we are to prosper in the ever more complex future we are entering. Yet taxpayer support for education is waning, with ever more money drawn off for administration and charter schools.

State-level taxpayer support for four-year public colleges fell 17 percent in real terms from the 2006–2007 academic year to 2012–2013, my analysis of National Center for Education Statistics data shows. Appropriations declined to $45.8 billion.

Federal appropriations, while only a tiny sliver of public four-year college budgets, fell even more, down 19 percent in real terms to $1.6 billion as Congress and President Barack Obama agreed on austerity budgets."

The cloud is, of course, the vast collection of distant databanks we use to back up our vacation photos, search the Web, make online purchases, find the quickest route home and do pretty much everything else. It is owned by unaccountable corporations, is regularly accessed by police and intelligence agencies and creates a convenient gold mine of credit card numbers, nude photos and other private data for malicious hackers to steal.

And increasingly, using it is no longer optional.

With the July release of its Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft has made the border between using your computer and using other peoples’ computers blurrier than ever before. Privacy advocates are warning about a host of default settings that make automatic sharing of data the new normal — from your voice and typing patterns to unique machine IDs that help advertisers identify, track and target you with personalized ads, even on your device’s lock screen. Basically, all the privacy worries of your smartphone and Web browser are now a regular part of a major desktop operating system.

This isn’t really a surprise. Microsoft’s previous iteration, Windows 8, laid the groundwork for a fully cloud-integrated operating system that phones home an alarming amount of user information and activity. Windows isn’t alone either: By default, users of Mac OSX and Ubuntu Linux unwittingly transmit local search terms to their respective companies as well as to third parties. Unless these settings are changed (learn how for Mac and for Ubuntu), these companies analyze everything users type into the search box to find a file or app on their hard drives, along with unique IDs and location data.

Windows 10 suggests that this trend is here to stay. Take Cortana, the operating system’s personal digital assistant, similar to Apple’s Siri. Cortana uses a feature called Getting to Know You — enabled by default — which allows Windows to automatically record, analyze and share your speech and typing patterns, as well as your location, contacts, calendars and more. We’re told this is for our own good because these kinds of apps, Siri and Google Now included, need our personal data in order to be useful. When the data are sent to Microsoft (or Apple or Google, plus any law enforcement agency or third party that the companies’ arcane terms of service agreements allow) they’re used to improve the algorithm that responds to our queries. There’s no way around this; it’s simply how the app was designed to work.

It’s the ultimatum that mainstream technology companies keep offering us: Either we give up our privacy to use the latest apps and features or we opt out and miss out. Accept the defaults or get left in the dust. Conform or die.

Even when people choose the former, in reality, they’re hardly ever consciously choosing anything. Defaults are powerful decisions that software companies make for us, and it’s always easier for users to do nothing — especially when they’re told it’s for their benefit. Studies have consistently shown that users rarely change their default settings, and companies that design software know it."

He was one of the protesters occupying the street in front of the city’s 4th Precinct police station. For more than two weeks, protesters led by Black Lives Matter and the NAACP took over this street, just a few blocks from where police shot and killed 24-year-old Jamar Clark on Nov. 15.

Undeterred by violence from white supremacists and Minnesota’s cold and snowy winter, activists are calling not only for justice for Clark but also for an end to racist policing and unequal socioeconomic structures throughout the city and state. Police dismantled their encampment on Dec. 3, but protesters are vowing to shift the focus to the Minneapolis City Hall.

Racism underlies police killings of black men and women — in Ferguson, in Minneapolis, in Chicago, in Baltimore and across the country. But the violence meted out to black people goes beyond the actions of individual police officers. Institutional and structural racism is evident not only in a hail of police bullets but also in the disparate health care, education, housing and employment that ensure black people live with more difficulty and die earlier than their white counterparts.

North Minneapolis, the site of Clark’s shooting and ongoing protests, has a long history of police brutality, poverty and government neglect. White flight from North Minneapolis began in the 1960s, amid residential segregation, lack of job opportunities and high poverty levels in the black community. In 1966, local leaders opened the Way, a controversial community center aimed at empowering the black community through youth recreational and educational programs, as well as voter registration campaigns and pressure on the city for services such as garbage collection. The Way was identified with the 1960s Black Power movement, and quickly came under criticism for demanding reforms to the police department. The Minneapolis Police Department's 4th Precinct station now occupies the ground where the Way once stood.

Minnesota prides itself on progressive politics, a thriving economy and excellent public education, but these benefits do not extend to the state's black community. The experience of people of color in Minnesota, says a 2014 ACLU report, “is hidden behind the widespread prosperity of white residents.” The report notes an unemployment rate for black Minnesotans that is 2.8 times that of white Minnesotans, and widespread residential segregation. North Minneapolis has a poverty rate of 36 percent, compared to a citywide rate of 22 percent. The median household income for white residents in Saint Paul and Minneapolis is $70,900 compared to $25,517 for black households, according to the nonprofit research center, Minnesota Compass. High school graduation rate is 80 percent for white students compared to only 60 percent for black youth.

The Minneapolis Police Department has been criticized for racism and violence for decades. Prominent cases include the shooting death of Terrance Franklin in 2013, the 2006 shooting death of Fong Lee and the shooting of police officer Duy Dinh Ngo in 2010 by a fellow officer. Police dominate the city's supposedly civilian review board."

But any response fashioned without a deep understanding of how past policies have created the current conditions in the Middle East runs a huge risk of creating global violence for decades and perhaps even centuries to come.

ISIL has no capacity to invade the United States or Europe. But it can make life unpleasant by deploying true believers to set off bombs, fire guns and disperse biological and chemical weapons.

A smart response requires a thorough understanding of what motivates ISIL’s leaders, what draws some zealous young people to die for the cause and how to exploit ISIL’s internal theological contradictions to discredit its religious claims.

We can’t kill our way out of this problem, but that seems to be the approach favored by French President François Hollande. The presence of French or American troops fighting ISIL would just help ISIL recruiting by lending credence to its claims that Christians have launched a crusade against Islam.

Just as the costs of war continue for generations after the last person dies in combat, policy mistakes create problems that may fester for decades. As President Barack Obama said in Turkey last week at the G-20 summit:

It is not just my view but the view of my closest military and civilian advisers that [having U.S. troops engage ISIL in ground combat] would be a mistake. Because we would see a repetition of what we’ve seen before, which is if you do not have local populations that are committed to inclusive governance and who are pushing back against ideological extremes, that they resurface, unless we’re prepared to have a permanent occupation of these countries.

The emerging caliphate in what we call Syria and Iraq would not exist but for a series of disastrous foreign policy mistakes by George W. Bush’s administration, especially its 2003 invasion of Iraq.

He promised to listen to his generals and admirals but then created massive distrust among high level military officers, in part because he ignored what is known as the Powell Doctrine — after Gen. Colin Powell’s belief in using only overwhelming force — and fired Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, whose advice on how to invade Iraq and keep it secure we now know was spot on.

Instead, Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney embraced the wishful thinking of right-wing ideologues they installed at the Pentagon. Civilians with no military experience or Middle East expertise — including Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith and L. Paul Bremer III — believed that ousting Arab dictators such as Saddam Hussein would make democracy flower in the Middle East.

Though the best form of government, democracy cannot be imposed from outside. As we have seen in Haiti, Russia and other countries, it does not take root in soil barren of the right mix of political nutrients: a commitment to allow the state to have a monopoly on violence, experience with local self-governance, education, tolerance and, as Aristotle taught, acceptance that as different leaders are chosen, citizens will “rule and be ruled in turns.”"

After a U.S.-led diplomatic push, the 47-member Human Rights Council — which counts Burundi among members — approved the text that calls for the U.N. human rights chief to send in a mission of experts who are to report regularly on the rights situation there.

The day-long debate Thursday among diplomats and advocacy groups was marked by a defense of Burundi's security forces by a government representative, and teary testimony by Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, a rights advocate who was tortured.

The U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, told the council that at least 400 people have been killed since April 26, and nearly 3,500 arrested in the political crisis. He said at least 220,000 people have fled the country.

Earlier this month, Thomas Perriello, the U.S. Special Envoy for Africa's Great Lakes region, said that Burundi is on the brink of civil war. Many fear clashes there could lead to violence like the 1994 massacres in nearby Rwanda.

The violence is linked to President Pierre Nkurunziza's third term in office, which many Burundians and foreign observers had opposed as unconstitutional and in violation of a peace accord.

The treaty ended a civil war in which 300,000 people were killed between 1993 and 2006.

An estimated 400,000 Americans have been shot and killed since 9/11.

On Oct. 1, a few hours after a 26-year-old gunman murdered nine people and injured 20 others at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, a visibly agitated President Barack Obama addressed a grieving nation — the 15th such statement he has given since taking office. “We’ve become numb to this,” he said from the White House. He’s right.

He has repeatedly called for tighter gun control laws — a desire shared by many Americans. However, any meaningful attempt at introducing stricter background checks on purchasers, for example, has fallen on deaf ears. “When Americans are killed in mine disasters,” lamented Obama, “we work to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer … the notion that gun violence is somehow different … doesn't make sense.”

His focus on the plight of shooting victims, however noble, exposes another, less discussed form of national numbness. The United States’ arms trade with countries that violate the human rights of their citizens is a major contributor to the armed violence that has gripped the Middle East, especially since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

Even as he implores the nation for the fate of Americans affected by gun violence, he has failed to acknowledge Washington’s responsibility for the lives of civilians whose oppressive governments kill and maim using U.S.-made weapons. So why is he antsy about tackling gun violence in the U.S. but silent on the excesses of the U.S. military-industrial complex?

The answer is simple: It’s a political choice. The U.S. is one of the largest suppliers of weapons to India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, all of which are strategically important but have dismal human rights records.

For example, this month the U.S. agreed to sell $1.29 billion worth of air-to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia. This adds to the arms deal announced on Sept. 30 to sell advanced air and missile defense systems worth $1.75 billion to Riyadh. The deal ignored Amnesty International’s call for the U.S. to halt its arms trade with Saudi Arabia, citing concerns over war crimes in Yemen, where the Saudis are conducting a controversial military campaign against Houthi rebels.

In addition, the rapid rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is in part the result of its ability to acquire modern weaponry from various sources.

ISIL commandeered some of these weapons from Iraqi forces that were trained and armed by the U.S. and its allies. Some weapons were bought on the black market, and according to The New York Times, Turkey and Saudi Arabia supplied some in a bid to destabilize the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Arms the U.S. shipped to the Free Syrian Army have also ended up in ISIL’s hands.

The resultant tensions have led to shifting regional alliances and competing interventions by antagonistic stakeholders, including Russia and the United States. However, none of this is surprising, given the myriad interests in the region."

And anyone who can’t find a job or is stuck with a low-paying job is told to acquire the skills necessary to succeed in today’s economy. Unfortunately, the results of believing in that myth have been catastrophic. Earnings have stagnated or declined for everyone except the very top earners, even for those who have educational qualifications, and jobs that didn’t previously require credentials now do. College-educated workers are increasingly forced to take jobs in low-paying industries. The skills gap is not why workers aren’t prospering. If it were, those with higher skills should be doing better, not worse. Instead, employees are victimized first by policy failure — since the economy is not operating at full employment, those who depend on their labor for living may not find work — and second by the deluded guidance of experts who point to education as a panacea for all their problems. As the chart below illustrates, the most-educated workers have seen their wages stagnate for the past seven years, and everyone else has suffered outright declines. A new study by sociologists Richard Breen and Inkwan Chung found that most of the increase in inequality over the last three decades occurred within different educational attainment groups rather than between them (i.e. the gap isn’t between high-school and college grads but within different educational categories). Instead, inequality primarily derives from the top 1 percent and 0.1 percent taking an increasingly large share of the national income. Breen and Chung conclude that equalizing educational attainment would do little to ameliorate such inequality.

Education hasn’t protected workers from falling wages. (Source: The Economic Policy Institute)

The education myth has also harmed the U.S. economy. For many young people, the harms are embodied in the increase in student debt and related pathologies such as job lock (being forced to stick with a bad job to make student loan payments) and low household formation (indebted graduates being forced to living with their parents). It also enables economic leeches such as for-profit higher education providers, senior university administrators and the student loan industry to prosper off young people. Anxiety over bad job prospects reached its height during the recent recession and its immediate aftermath. At the same time, average student debt and payment levels as well as enrollment in for-profit colleges — whose students often depend on loans to finance their educations — increased starkly. Implicit federal subsidies to for-profit schools have also expanded dramatically, even as state-level appropriations to public institutions of higher education continue to be slashed. This was done on the premise that students will finance their educations when the benefits of doing so are obvious and the means exists in the form of loans. The results are beginning to show in a wave of delinquencies, including the high-profile case of Corinthian Colleges, which went belly up in the face of state and federal regulatory scrutiny about its marketing promises and its graduates’ employment prospects. And employment and earnings outcomes for recent labor market entrants continue to lag their predecessors’. Those who continue to pay off debt accrued in pursuit of degrees they did or, worse, didn’t complete are laboring under the burden of a mistaken ideology. At the very best, professional credentials protect workers from the fate befalling those without — a very expensive rat race. But educational attainment alone doesn’t improve aggregate employment outcomes, nor do more degrees benefit the economy when it is operating below capacity.

The education myth blames the victims of economic misfortune for being underskilled and offers them a way out through debt-financed higher education credentials.

The education myth dubiously posits that increasing access to higher education can increase upward mobility and reduce racial inequality. But in a recent study, economists William R. Emmons and Bryan J. Noeth found that the effects of higher education are not the same across racial and ethnic groups. As shown in the chart below, the median net worth of a non-Hispanic white family without a college degree is higher than the median net worth of a black or Hispanic family with a college degree. There are deep racial gaps in employment rates, even among college graduates. Cherrie Bucknor, a research associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, reports (PDF) that wages for black men have fallen since the late 1970s, including for those who followed the education myth and obtained a college degree. In fact, according to a recent analysis by Demos and the Institute on Assets and Social Policy, “increasing graduation rates would reduce the wealth disparity between black and white people by only 1 percent and between Latinos and whites by 3 percent.”

While the benefits of college rarely accrue to black people and Latinos, the costs do. As shown in the chart below, black and Latino students are far more likely to borrow for a bachelor’s degree at public and private colleges and black students borrow nearly $4,000 more for their degrees. And such borrowing doesn’t guarantee a degree. “At all schools, nearly 4 in 10 (39 percent) of black borrowers drop out of college, compared [with] 29 percent of white borrowers,” according to Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at Demos.

2016-02-24 00:00:00,http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/24/the-rapid-dna-revolution.html,The Rapid DNA Revolution,[u'Ava Kofman'],"[u'reveal', u'program', u'rapid', u'dna', u'database', u'dhs', u'national', u'testing', u'revolution', u'test', u'technology']","But not everyone is as excited as Comey about the way the world might change. Immigrant advocates, lawyers and civil rights groups have raised concerns that the portable technology exacerbates the privacy violations already posed by invasive biometric collection , increases the surveillance of vulnerable individuals and links a wide range of documented and undocumented civilians to the FBI’s massively expanding identification database . They warn that the technology represents a step forward in the construction of a nationwide DNA index and a giant leap backward for civil liberties.

During a Senate committee hearing in December on the Rapid DNA Act of 2015, FBI Director James Comey said that passage of the bill “would help us change the world in a very, very exciting way. [It will] allow us, in booking stations around the country, if someone’s arrested, to know instantly — or near instantly — whether that person is the rapist who’s been on the loose in a particular community before they’re released on bail and get away or to clear somebody, to show that they’re not the person.”

A new law could change that. A bill before Congress , introduced in December by Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, would allow profiles collected by rapid DNA devices in the field to be connected to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS , the software and national database that houses DNA profiles from federal, state and local forensic laboratories.

The Department of Homeland Security plans to begin using the automated technology later this year to vet the identity and kinship claims of refugees and immigrants. Meanwhile, police departments across the country — from Palm Bay, Florida, to Tucson, Arizona — have rolled out their own pilot programs to test these miniature DNA labs. In December, results from a rapid DNA device were submitted as evidence in a successful murder prosecution for the first time . But despite the technology’s full functionality, its uses have been limited.

Your DNA can now be read in less time than it would take to wait at a typical DMV. Unlike traditional DNA testing, which takes at least two days and requires processing at a laboratory, new and portable rapid DNA devices can give quick results anywhere in under two hours, since agents simply insert a “tagged” cheek swab into the microwave-sized machine.

This technology has so far been useful. There's no technical limitation to using it right now.

The DHS recognizes that its Rapid DNA program “may create controversy,"" according to internal documents obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, or EFF, a civil liberties group. In a high priority e-mail from 2011, a DHS officer wrote to colleagues that “if DHS fails to provide an adequate response to [media] inquiries [regarding RapidDNA] quickly, civil rights/civil liberties organizations may attempt to shut down the test program.”

Until the current law is amended by a bill like Hatch’s, law enforcement agencies can only use results from accredited laboratories, rather than rapid DNA analysis, to search for matches in the FBI’s national database.

The DHS planned to introduce the devices last October , but as of this week, no date for its pilot programs has been set. “The implementation of the program has been postponed until new voluntary consent forms are developed as well as operational protocols for translation, ” said Verrico, the DHS spokesman.

The FBI first proposed a system for a mobile DNA analysis technology that could be integrated with the national DNA database in 2006, but a bevy of legal, ethical and technical factors delayed its rollout.

But despite these benefits, there are several technological drawbacks to rapid DNA, including its limited sensitivity and high cost. Although many lawmakers have praised the technology for its ability to help with rape kit backlogs, rapid DNA cannot actually test rape kits since the technology can only test samples from a high-quality single source, explained Mike Benevento, the general manager of human identification at GE Healthcare. When compared with the price of traditional DNA-lab testing, a rapid DNA test is not cheap — approximately $350 per sample .

Some police departments say they are already seeing the benefits of the technology, despite the fact that their rapid DNA samples are not integrated with the national system. In Arizona, the Tucson Police Department and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been running a pilot program that integrates rapid DNA analyses with the state’s DNA database. Vince Figarelli, the superintendent of the Arizona Department of Public Safety crime laboratory, said the department’s three machines have been used since March to solve cases involving burglary, an officer-involved shooting in which the suspect left blood behind at the scene and a sexual assault case.

Rapid DNA would transform this process by giving officers definitive results about the likelihood of kinship between a parent and a child on the spot, DHS spokesperson John S. Verrico said. The technology will also aid agents operating in disaster areas to identify mass casualty victims, he added. Rapid DNA’s approach consists of miniaturizing the extraction, amplification, separation and detection processes — all without human intervention.

Despite the fact that DNA stands among the most unique of individual identifiers, lengthy processing times and high costs have often made it a second choice for generating investigative leads in a criminal case or for verifying someone’s identity. Immigration officers currently confirm whether or not adults are related to the children they are traveling with in the U.S. through extensive interviews and documentation. But the method is far from perfect for preventing child trafficking or verifying kinship-based asylum claims. In 2008, the State Department suspended its family reunification program, citing widespread kinship fraud — the practice of claiming a fraudulent biological relationship with someone in the U.S. in order to gain entry as a refugee. The reunification program was reinstated only in 2012 with the requirement that asylum seekers submit to DNA testing, which takes weeks.

'There are serious questions about whose DNA is being taken by the police and when it should be searched and how.'

In the past decade, the scope of DNA collection and storage has steadily expanded. “Many states have gone from collecting the DNA of violent convicted offenders to collecting the DNA of anyone arrested,” said Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. Over half the states now collect DNA from arrestees and the FBI stores the DNA of more than 3.5 percent of the U.S. population. And civil rights organizations say a Supreme Court decision last June — in which five justices ruled that taking DNA samples from arrestees without a warrant or conviction constituted a reasonable search — will further expand the FBI database. They point to warning signs like the 2015 omnibus budget, which allocated $117 million “for a DNA analysis and capacity enhancement program and for other local, state, and federal forensic activities.”

“There are serious questions about whose DNA is being taken by the police and when it should be searched and how,” said Penn State law professor David Kaye, who has served on the National Commission on Forensic Science and the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence. Kaye added that he is not particularly troubled by rapid DNA technology but, instead, by a lack of proper policies governing its use. “Should we draw the line at arrest? Should we draw the line at conviction? Going to the other extreme, why not put everybody’s DNA up there [in the FBI’s database]?”

Until further details about the program are available, many privacy lawyers and forensic experts are concerned that the DNA samples indefinitely stored in the FBI’s databases could someday be used for purposes beyond simple identification or kinship testing, such as warrantless searches or to reveal information about a person’s health. Unlike the fingerprint, DNA has the potential to reveal excessively personal information about an individual that may be subject to misuse, said Stanley. “As we move into the future, many more correlations might be found between various genes and conditions,” he explained. Indeed, DHS documents obtained by EFF state that the military may be interested in using rapid DNA in the future to reveal information about individuals such as their sex, race, health and age.

Some immigration advocates fear that mandating widespread DNA tests for refugees could reveal secrets about parentage that should not affect a family’s asylum claim, such as whether a child is a product of an infidelity or rape. Further, they claim that kinship testing implies a literal and “nuclear” conception of family that excludes an understanding of other arrangements, such as those of families who take in orphans.

Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney at EFF, says one of her biggest questions is what the FBI plans to do with the DNA sample after it is collected. She fears that the continued storage of genetic samples from asylum seekers of certain races or ethnicities could leave these overrepresented communities more vulnerable to false matches when the database is searched in the future. “We know that DNA matching can be wrong,” she said. “People can be suspects for crimes they didn’t commit. And if your database is disproportionately made up of one race or ethnicity, you are subjecting them to increased searches and the increased chances of false positives.”

In a 2013 privacy impact assessment for rapid DNA pilot testing, the DHS stated that the portion of DNA analyzed by the devices does not reveal any “sensitive information about an individual, and will not, under any circumstances, be used for decisions based on those criteria.” Manufacturers of rapid DNA have also stated that their technology does not reveal any personal information but could potentially be designed in the future to process an expanded set of loci — the portion of the chromosome analyzed.

“We’ve seen this with a lot of technologies,” Stanley said. “The more it’s used the more it can be used.”

Nienstedt may personally be linked to the scandal: In 2014 he first ordered, and then blocked, an internal investigation of his private life. His resignation, which came after years of his insistence that he would not resign, was announced, but not explained. It highlights the bigger issues that are dogging the Catholic Church on every continent. Nienstedt’s resignation also underscores the struggle between progressives and conservatives over abuse of authority by bishops and the Vatican and, ultimately, over the direction the church will take under Pope Francis.

The fallout within the Minneapolis-St. Paul archdiocese is not surprising. Years of clergy sex abuse scandals have led to bankruptcy and the departure of many Catholics from the church. In fact, the abuses that led to Nienstedt's resignation were first reported more than 30 years ago. Public concern escalated in 2013 as Minnesota Public Radio published an investigative series based on new evidence disclosed by diocesan canon lawyer and whistleblower, Jennifer Haselberger. The MPR reports, which documented sexual abuse of children by priests and the failure of three archbishops to respond over 30 years time, catapulted the archdiocese into a national spotlight.

The new revelations outraged Catholics across the state and nation. They already knew about the sex abuse by priests, with reports starting at least in the 1970s, but the extent of abuse and cover-ups had never been disclosed. For example, archbishops failed to report crimes to police, transferred pedophile priests from parish to parish, and sometimes arranged early retirement and special payments to the accused priests.

Still, the Minnesota archdiocese is not alone. From Australia to Poland to Chile, virtually every Catholic diocese has been smirched by clergy sex abuse scandal. Pope Francis took office in 2013. In 2014, he established the Commission for the Protection of Minors, which reports directly to him. This summer, as that commission began to get up to speed, he approved the creation of yet another tribunal to judge bishops accused of failing to act to protect victims of clerical sex abuse.

Some critics have dismissed the tribunal as smoke and mirrors, since it only requires reporting clerical abuse to church authorities, not to local police or civil authorities. Their concerns are valid. For example, in 2012 Missouri Bishop Robert Finn was convicted of failing to report allegations of child abuse to police. But the Vatican allowed Finn to stay on as a bishop for two and a half years after his conviction. Finn finally resigned in April, perhaps forced, or at least strongly encouraged, by Vatican officials."

Outsider Donald Trump’s status as the GOP presidential front-runner highlights the party’s weakness.

But Democrats are facing a major challenge all their own. A 2014 Gallup poll found that the percentage of Americans who identify as Democrats is at the lowest point since the 1950s. The party hemorrhaged supporters from 2008 to 2014, falling from 36 to 30 percent of national voters in the span of six years (Republicans saw a 2 point drop in the same period.)

What’s going on? Certainly, voters are frustrated with Washington, which has been deadlocked and bitterly partisan, particularly over the past eight years. And racial animus undoubtedly drove some supporters out of the Democratic Party after the election of Barack Obama in 2008, although this is nearly impossible to verify through polling.

But a major reason is that the mainstream Democratic Party has abandoned the white working class, a segment of the population that used to make up the backbone of the party. Rather than sending a message that poorer white Americans still matter to the party, Democratic elites tend to dismiss them as racist, uneducated and uninformed.

Research shows that working-class Americans are the people who have lost the most worldwide as a result of free trade and outsourcing, with real wages dropping over time. And in 2008, the housing bubble burst, wreaking havoc predominantly in lower-income communities.

For the white working class in particular, the price has been steep. Recent research by two Princeton economists found that while death rates among all other racial and ethnic groups are falling, death rates have been rising among middle-aged white Americans, particularly those with no more than a high school degree. Dramatic increases in suicide and substance abuse, notably of heroin and prescription opioids, are the primary drivers of the additional deaths. Deepening poverty and persistent unemployment are at the root of it all. Nearly all the full-time, well-paying jobs created since the recession have gone to college graduates.

Meanwhile, Democrats have failed to support, and at times helped to destroy, the unions that used to protect this segment of society. They have failed to find ways to keep manufacturing communities alive against the forces of globalization.

White working-class people are understandably angry. They used to believe middle-class security was an attainable goal. Now they don’t. Belief in the American Dream has plummeted among white Americans. From 1986 to 2015, a period of economic stagnation for working-class communities, the percentage of young, white Americans who said the American Dream does not exist nearly tripled."

Their argument was simple: The reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers will increase efficiency and economic growth. This is the standard argument for free trade.

Given this general view within the economics profession why TPP is good policy, it is striking that so few economists have been outspoken in opposition to the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that aids U.S. exports through loan and insurance guarantees. On June 30, Congress did not reauthorize the bank, which meant that it could not extend new credit, though it could still manage its existing portfolio of loans. Republican Senators led a vote to reauthorize the bank in the Senate, and now the issue has moved to the House. The whole point of the Ex-Im Bank, of course, is to have the government subsidize selected companies by giving them access to credit at below-market interest rates. This is totally at odds with free trade. It means the government is allocating credit rather than markets. It would be expected to lead to the same type of economic distortions as tariffs and quotas.

The arguments put forward in support of the Ex-Im Bank should have been especially painful to economists, since they are exactly the same arguments made in support of protectionist trade measures. For example, proponents of the Ex-Im Bank routinely talk about the number of jobs supported by the bank’s loans, implying that all of these jobs would somehow disappear without subsidized loans from the Ex-Im Bank.

This would be comparable to adding up all the jobs in the U.S. auto industry and arguing that these jobs would be lost if we eliminated trade barriers to imports. This is wrong first because the vast majority of the jobs would still be there without the subsidized loans or trade barriers, and second, jobs lost in one sector will be replaced by jobs gained elsewhere. This is the textbook free-trade story.

The other argument that should have vexed economists was the claim that we make a profit on the Ex-Im Bank. This is true. The government is the lowest cost borrower in the country because no one questions its creditworthiness. This means the government can always profit by lending at interest rates that are between the market rate for its borrowers and its own borrowing rate.

No economist would argue that this “profit” means that such loans are good policy or carry no cost. It means that the government is effectively diverting capital away from some companies and toward the ones it has favored with below-market interest rate loans. Invariable these are huge companies such as Boeing and General Electric, who always account for the vast majority of Ex-Im lending. This is only good policy if we think that the government is likely to do a better job than the market in allocating credit."

Before the Jim Crow era, as South Carolina Anglican minster the Rev. Charles Woodsman expressed in 1766, people such as Dylann Roof were viewed with disdain by white elites as people who “delight in their present low, lazy, sluttish, heathenish, hellish life, and seem not desirous of changing it.” The so-called white trash, Wray writes, “reveals itself as an expression of fundamental tensions and deep structural antimonies: between the sacred and the profane, purity and impurity, morality and immorality, cleanliness and dirt.”

Sadly, African-American flourishing, enabled in part by the black church, was reinterpreted as a threat to the achievement of true whiteness by working-class and lower-class white people. This narrative of race and class may explain why Dylan Roof chose a black church, as opposed to anywhere else, to express his racial animus.

The black church in America remains one of the greatest catalysts of African-American well-being in our nation’s history. Since the formation of black Christian congregations on slave plantations, it has served as a place for spiritual formation, black dignity, training and education, organizing for social justice, sustaining marriage and family, caring for the poor and so much more.

Lower-class white people and European immigrant groups, as historian David R. Roediger explains in “Working Toward Whiteness: How America’s Immigrants Became White,” had to work really hard to distinguish themselves from black people in order to be perceived as truly white. Not to live up to the cultural expectations of whiteness, regardless of one’s actual skin color, was to invite utter disdain from educated land-owning elites. Find ways to project the negative attributes that white elites had for “white trash,” “rednecks” and “crackers” became a group-forming mission across America. Roediger notes that one of the first words immigrants learned after they arrived in America was “nigger.” To be accepted as white in America, people must do all they can to prove that they are not black. Jim Crow laws made this acceptance local law.

As long as lower-class white people could have a class of people beneath them who were considered more immoral, violent, lustful and lazy, they could have greater access to the means of acquiring dignity, social standing and the American dream. After all, to be white in America was to be of primarily English stock, educated, a property owner, a participant and shareholder in America’s political and economic power centers. Lower-class white people were told that the one group standing in their way of achieving social true whiteness were “Negroes.” From the formation of the Klu Klux Klan to the introduction of Jim Crow laws to the normalizing of white supremacy, white racism had as much to do with achieving whiteness — with class standing — as with racial animus.

Such racialized class conflict places black flourishing — and white backlashes against it — in perspective. Consider the racist website registered on Feb. 9 in the name of Dylann Roof. “Integration has done nothing but bring Whites down to level of brute animals,” the website says. “Who is fighting for these White people forced by economic circumstances to live among negroes?” it asks. “Too many blacks here,” it complains, railing against “affirmative action,” the alleged “lower IQs, lower impulse control and higher testosterone levels in generals” of “negroes.” It then issues a call to “drastic action.” In the antebellum and Jim Crow South, such drastic actions took the form of domestic terrorism against black people and their churches.

Over the past few days, unsurprisingly, pictures of Roof with the Confederate battle flag surfaced on the Internet. The Confederate flag to men like Roof is a symbol of achieving a white dignity and respectability that was taken away by the war of “Northern aggression.” Lower-class white people need the Confederate flag as a sacramental sign and seal reminding them that they are not what elites have always believed them to be: lazy, stupid, immoral and dirty. The flag says, “No, we will define our white dignity on Southern terms.” Unfortunately, those Southern terms were forged during a history of black subjugation and violence. The greatest resistance, however, to the evil terms of the Southern states’ right to white supremacy was the black church. “Mother Emmanuel” was at the head of those churches. Dylan Roof murderously revisited the historic Southern, lower-class struggle for true whiteness on June 17, 2015. Hopefully not only will he fail but he also will ignite public resolve to address such animosities and atone for America’s greatest sin."

Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has retired. The No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2001, will finally be behind us. The presidential races are wide open, and whoever succeeds Barack Obama will take the helm with very different public opinion winds guiding his or her education policy sails.

Duncan’s Department of Education should be seen as a bridge between the standards-and-accountability-driven era that is coming to a close and an emerging new approach to education that places standards and accountability within a broader framework focused on multiple domains of child development, including not only college and career readiness but also civic and life readiness.

There is no doubt that, as his strongest proponents assert, he cared deeply about poor and minority children and the barriers that prevented them from getting a fair shake in our education system. But his track record is rife with contradictions. He saw flaws in the system that limited disadvantaged students’ opportunities and worked hard to change them. But he also enacted and stubbornly stuck with policies that put that fair shake even further out of reach.

Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Duncan’s legacy has been his Office of Civil Rights. It has been stalwart in bringing to the nation’s attention ways that our education system is rigged against poor children, especially black and Hispanic students. Under his watch, the office released groundbreaking data on race- and income-based disparities in school funding, on associated disparities in resources and teacher quality and on the harsh disciplinary measures disproportionately meted out to students of color.

His department has led the way on innovative policies to counter these problems. Under him, the Department of Education initiated grants for Promise Neighborhoods, modeled on the Harlem Children’s Zone, which build school-community partnerships to mitigate poverty-related barriers to learning. Shining a spotlight on how income- and race-based disparities often begin early in life, he and Obama have made new federal investments in early education a top priority of the president’s second term. Most recently, the department has worked with states and school districts to revisit and improve rules on disciplinary measures."

“Tomorrow morning we will have climate refugees,” he said bluntly, urging European leaders to tackle climate change, one of the factors exacerbating the ongoing exodus. “We should not be surprised or astonished if the first climate refugees are coming to Europe.”

Global warming is responsible for longer-lasting droughts, more violent storms and rising sea levels that worsen the living conditions of hundreds of millions of people. Its fallout, Juncker warned, will trigger massive and increasing refugee flows — unless the EU and its international partners get serious about reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

He called for an “ambitious, robust and binding” climate treaty at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris this December to prevent unmanageable emigration. The summit aims to forge an international treaty to keep the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius — a goal that looks increasingly unlikely even in the best-case scenario.

German sociologist Harald Welzer, who popularized the term “climate wars,” argues that a scarcity of resources — arable soil, food and water — is one of the powerful new forces shaping the 21st century. This has been intensified by the rise in global temperatures and ever more extreme weather.

As a result of climate change, Welzer wrote in his 2012 book, “Climate Wars: What People Will Be Killed for in the 21st Century,” “inhabitable spaces shrink, scarce resources become scarcer, and injustices grow deeper, not only between north and south but also between generations.” Countries in the Southern Hemisphere will suffer droughts, floods and soil erosion. Our not-so-distant future, he argued, will be marked by violent conflicts over drinking water, enormous refugee movements and civil wars in the world’s poorest countries.

The drivers of the current migration flows are complex and diverse — the Syrian war, poverty in the Balkans, instability in Iraq and Afghanistan and political repression in Eritrea. Climate change may not be as visible as some of these other causes, but it already plays a major role in those countries.

Take the war in Syria, which has caused 4 million people to flee since 2011. One of the conflict’s oft-overlooked causes was water shortage. A severe multiyear drought that began in 2007 caused crops to fail and arable land to turn into desert.

“Syria was destabilized by 1.5 million migrants from rural communities fleeing a three-year drought that was made more intense and persistent by human-driven climate change, which is steadily making the whole eastern Mediterranean and Middle East region even more arid,” Columbia University professor Richard Seager said in a recent study on the role of climate change in the Syrian conflict. “Syria is not the only country affected by this drying. Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Iraq and Iran are too.”"

Gathered in Washington, D.C., for their annual legislative meeting, the members of the organization, which is tasked with improving police professionalism, turned off the TV set midgame when the superstar performed part of her new single, “Formation.”

The association’s president told The Washington Examiner about this petty boycott, stating that the cops were angered that the NFL permitted the performance of what is, in their view, an anti-police song. Meanwhile, on Fox News, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani agreed. “I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers,” he said of the show.

Had Beyoncé actually used an enormous televised spectacle to attack police, I would have welcomed it. There should be no limit to the censure leveled at an institution drenched in racist violence that kills black teen males at a rate 10 times higher than their white peers. But she did not attack the police. She paid homage to black power and black life. Dancers clad in black berets raised their fists in fierce formation, recalling the salutes of sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympics.

While Beyoncé tapped the recognizable iconography of historic black struggle and anger, she hardly recited the Black Panther Party’s 10 point program. Needless to say, she is no radical Panther; she supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and dines with President Barack Obama. Beyoncé is, however, becoming a symbol of black strength. It is no small thing that police institutions, Giuliani and numerous regressive Tweeters responded to powerful blackness by calling its very invocation an attack on police.

Let’s turn to the details of her latest song, its politically charged video and her Sunday night performance, which have all left police feeling embattled. In her show she referred to historic black struggle largely through her dancers’ uniforms and salutes. In her “Formation” video, riot cops raise their hands (“Hands up, don’t shoot” style) to a dancing black little boy in a hoodie. Writing on a wall reads “Stop shooting us,” and she sits atop a half-sunk New Orleans police cruiser, which, tellingly, eventually sinks and pulls her down with it.

The song is a paean to Southern blackness. Lyrics include “I like my baby hair, with baby hair and Afros” and “I just might be a black Bill Gates in the making.” Police are not mentioned at all. The extent of Bey’s “attack” was a simple reference to American police officers shooting black people, symbolized by a young hooded black child. These are facts, not contentions — but facts that the sheriffs’ association would rather you not hear or see.

An institution that reads the mere mention of its very violent flaws as an affront is incapable of reform. Those who see Beyoncé’s allusions to police racism as an attack on policing unwittingly assert that this racism is an essential and representative part of policing. They elide critiques of racist police violence with critiques of all police. It is they who call a hoodie-clad dancing black child a danger to policing, hauntingly echoing the police’s assertion that 12-year-old Tamir Rice presented a threat enough to justify a shot in the stomach."

This is an epochal change on Wall Street worthy of the Tuesday morning placement at the top of the New York Times front page, even though the news actually broke a year ago.

Potentially Goldman will make it easier, faster and cheaper for people and businesses to take out loans from a few thousands of dollars to a few tens of thousands of dollars. But in doing so, it just may weaken retail banking, resulting in less competition and more power for Goldman. It also is not without risk to taxpayers and Goldman customers, not least because the law has yet to define the relative rights and duties of such borrowers, lenders and investors in the new banking trend that Goldman said it will join next year.

So while this new venture may be an economic and social good, we should be wary, given Goldman’s long and troubled history of taking advantage of customers and taxpayers alike. Keep in mind that Goldman tarnished its reputation for decades because it took care of itself first in 1929, ruining the fortunes of many famous clients.

When the financial crisis struck in 2008, caused in no small part by dishonest Goldman tactics that dumped overvalued mortgage securities on pension funds, the company converted from an investment bank to a bank-holding company. That conversion allowed it to receive a $10 billion super-cheap loan from the federal government, even though there’s no indication it needed any help.

Goldman has always preferred help to pulling itself by its own bootstraps. To juice its profits, the firm applies for all the corporate welfare it can get, raking in taxpayer money from more than 240 welfare programs since 2000 at the local, state and federal level, according to the nonprofit research organization Good Jobs First.

Its $2.4 billion headquarters, built in 2008, was financed with tax-exempt, government-authorized bonds. The headquarters, by the way, bear no sign or logo that would give any passerby a hint that Goldman owns the building at 200 West Street in Lower Manhattan.

Goldman’s decision to go downscale as a retail lender appears to be motivated by a confluence of technology and a world awash in cash, but with few profitable places to invest. That’s because sagging incomes and slow job growth mean people lack the capacity to buy much in new goods and services. As a result, demand for its traditional underwriting business for new stocks and bonds is less than robust.

Retail banks are in the business of borrowing money at wholesale rates and lending that money out at the higher rates charged retail customers. In this they are like supermarkets, which profit off the difference in the price they pay for groceries arriving by the truckload at the backdoor and the price paid by people with paper bags at the front door. The markup on the price between wholesale and retail generates big profits from relatively small investments.

“Three and three” was the historic rule in banking: Borrow at 3 percent and lend at a markup of 3 percentage points more. (There was also the third three: Hit the golf course by that time in the afternoon.)

Goldman, however, can borrow money wholesale these days at less than 1 percent and then lend to creditworthy borrowers with much higher markups, certainly 5 percent more and perhaps even 10 percent more."

The quartet’s importance goes far beyond its pivotal role in brokering a democratic transition in 2013 and 2014: It can provide important lessons for other Arab countries as well as foreign powers that remain perplexed about how to respond to continuing Arab struggles for freedom, dignity and democracy.

The quartet’s composition was the crucial starting point of its successes. It consisted of the country’s largest labor union (UGTT), its employers’ federation (UTICA), its lawyers’ association and the Tunisian Human Rights Association. The first two represented Tunisian workers and business owners, critical poles of the economy; the lawyers and human rights activists represented the rule of law, constitutionalism and citizen rights in the pluralistic democracy that would replace the old dictatorship.

These four organizations had the moral authority and political credibility required to achieve constitutional democracy, but they also took three practical steps to enable their success. They made regular compromises among those in authority, including rotating power and voluntarily relinquishing the premiership; ensured that major decisions reflected inclusive consultations among all political actors and the public; and patiently phased in all major steps toward their democracy.

The phasing in was crucial, in view of the failures of Libya, Yemen and Egypt, all of which rushed into elections before forming a consensus constitution. The first step was the agreed resignation of the coalition government headed by Al-Nahda, an Islamic party, which won 37 percent of the votes in the first post-revolution elections of October 2011. This reflected a consensus that nonpartisan leadership would best manage the next crucial steps toward democracy, especially agreeing on the constitution and overseeing the elections. (Egypt’s transition stalled and reversed, with an army-run autocracy now in power, because the Muslim Brotherhood and the armed forces, in turn, used their control of the government to shape a constitution that favored them rather than one that reflected a true national consensus.)

The consultations that led to the Tunisian Constitution of January 2014 then opened the path to elect a parliament and president in late 2014. The Constitutional Court, which preserves the inviolability of the constitution and its guarantees of citizen rights, played an important role. The power-sharing concept, critical in the quartet’s work, is institutionalized in the agreement that the 12 members of the Constitutional Court would be named by the president, the parliament and the Supreme Judicial Council, each of which names four judges, one of whom must not be a legal expert. This helps make sure that the ruling party, the opposition and civil society all play a part in naming the court’s judges."

The 49-year-old rapper more popularly known as Too $hort had failed to complete the community service portion of a 2013 sentence for a driving under the influence charge and as penalty was offered a choice between 90 days in jail or three years of probation. Shaw took the jail time.

Though probation was originally conceived as a way of helping people avoid jail for minor offenses, over time many have come to prefer jail. In 2010, Texas prosecutor Richard Albert estimated roughly 70 percent of people with impaired-driving convictions who came through his office wound up choosing jail time over probation offers. In 2011, Wisconsin Judge Peter Grimm noticed a similar trend with misdemeanor drug cases. “They wind up doing quite a bit of jail time,” he told the Wisconsin Law Journal, “but at least when they are done, they are no longer on probation.”

If serving probation has come to seem more onerous than doing time, it’s worth considering whether the program should exist at all. Today, probation is an extension of the punishment of prison, a threat-driven oversight program. It offers few resources to help probationers learn new job skills or reintegrate into their communities. But probation makes it easier to issue longer prison sentences for simple misdemeanors, because every crime carries an added charge of being a probation violation.

The number of people on criminal probation in the United States has dramatically expanded in the last several decades. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 4.7 million people on probation or parole in 2013, with the overwhelming majority — 3.9 million — on probation, a massive increase from just 1.2 million in 1980. Around half of all people released on probation are arrested again within three years, with the majority of violations coming from nonviolent drug offenses. A 2013 study from California found that one in three drug arrests involved someone on probation or parole, compared to one in five of all arrests.

Although placing someone on probation is cheaper than imprisonment, it is still a significant expense. A 2014 Pew Study of 34 American states found the government spent around $2.5 billion on probation and parole programs in 2008 compared to $18.65 billion spent on prisons. As the probationer population has expanded, politicians have imposed major budget cuts on probation programs around the country, with a 20 percent cut in funds for counseling services implemented in 2013 and a 9 percent reduction in federal probation officers and court staff since 2011. With little or no funding to pay for rehabilitative programs such as family counseling, continuing education or subsidized housing, governments are sending probationers into society with insufficient support.

Meanwhile, probationers are also often left with expensive bills for drug tests, court fees or monitoring apps for their phones. Though exact costs vary by state and terms of probation, a report from Human Rights Watch found probation costs are often significantly more than the original fine, even for petty misdemeanors. The report cites as typical the case of a Georgia woman fined $377 for driving without a license who later wound up owing $500 in probation fees. In addition to fees, the burden of having to make regular trips to a facility for check-ins can make it difficult to keep up a regular work schedule."

The levels of surveillance introduced after 9/11 could have been considered reasonable only in the climate of collective panic that the attacks induced. But this week’s reaction to the fatal shooting of four Marines and a Navy petty officer in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by a 24-year-old Muslim has to win the prize for the worst proposed civil liberties infringement to come out of a violent disruption. No matter how high tensions may have run after the Boston Marathon bombing or 9/11, few dared to propose what figures of both left and right have now suggested: the segregation and internment of Muslim citizens.

The first mention of internment came from a somewhat unexpected source: Gen. Wesley Clark, a Democrat known for his progressive-oriented presidential campaign in 2004. Interviewed on MSNBC in the shooting’s aftermath, Clark said the U.S. needed to increasingly get tough on “radicalized” individuals. He spoke favorably of the internment camps set up during World War II, saying that “if someone supported Nazi Germany at the expense of the United States, we didn’t say that was freedom of speech. We put him in a camp.” Lest there be any doubt what Clark was advocating, he insisted that for radicalized Muslims, “it’s our right and obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.”

One might point out, in the first place, that the idea of detaining people for “the duration of the conflict” means, in practice, imprisoning them forever.

In total, $20,500 for the family of five.

The Taliban kidnapped one of my relatives, and when they found out he was in the army and worked for the government, they killed him. I came down from my shop and saw his dead body. They abducted other people and demanded ransom. We were afraid to go out at night. Then a Taliban rocket hit my shop and demolished it. After that, it was difficult to earn a living. Still, the Taliban would ask us for money. They also asked us to join forces to fight the government. That was also the reason I left.

Afghans are the second-largest group of asylum seekers reaching the Greek isles. Mubarek and his wife braved the two-month journey from Parwan, in northern Afghanistan, to the Greek coast with their young sons ages 5, 7, and 12. He told us:

The ever-growing threat of the Islamic State in Syria and the Levant (ISIL) is forcing people to flee the region in droves. Mohannad, a 30-year-old from Raqqah, Syria, told us that ISIL “put you in detention just because you don’t have a beard, and they whip you. If they arrest you at a checkpoint and find cigarettes on you, you are beaten and locked out in direct sun for a day.” For him, the $1,500 he paid a smuggler to help him escape to Greece was well worth the money.

“We came here illegally,” he said. “It’s the first time in my life I did something illegal. I was forced to do this kind of journey because I didn’t want to put my family in danger.”

Hannan, 47, and Ghazal, 55, reached the Greek island of Lesbos the night before we met. They left Aleppo with their three adult children, including Karan, their youngest, who has physical and developmental disabilities. Speaking over each other, as couples do, they told us they had left a good life in Syria because of the fighting, the crumbling infrastructure, and a lack of medical care for their son. In contrast to the common characterization of refugees as opportunists, Ghazal was ashamed to have come to Greece without permission.

My colleagues and I have interviewed hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers in numerous European Union countries, from Spain to Bulgaria. In May, we spoke with men, women and children who had just arrived on the Italian and Greek coasts. They came from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan, countries torn apart by war and violence, and from Eritrea, which has one of the most repressive governments in Africa.

The deaths of thousands of refugees in the Mediterranean have finally caught the attention of European lawmakers. But what makes people leave their homes? Leave their families? Trek across half of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, endure incredible hardship and abuse by smugglers, and then risk their lives on unseaworthy boats?

Search-and-rescue efforts have made a difference, but the EU should commit to sustaining such initiatives over the long-term to avoid future deaths at sea.

Fear of military conscription and recruitment by armed groups is a common reason for flight, from not only Syria and Afghanistan, but also Somalia and Eritrea. Young Somali men we spoke with on Lampedusa, Italy’s tiny outpost in the Mediterranean, also talked about the impact of the armed Islamist group Al-Shabaab on their lives.

Abdishakur, a 19-year-old from Mogadishu, told us that al-Shabaab “come and blow up houses, mosques. Al-Shabaab approaches guys like me to convert them, get them to blow themselves up. If they come, you do the mission and you die. If you don’t, they kill you.”

Fahad, 18, left Mogadishu for similar reasons but was caught at the Sudanese-Ethiopian border after Ethiopian soldiers fired at the car packed with other refugees and asylum seekers. He told us:

Three people died from bullet wounds. I spent one month in prison. They wanted to deport me to Somalia, but I escaped. I made contact with a smuggler and then was one month in Sudan waiting for others to join the group. They took us to the desert in southern Libya. I stayed there six months because my family didn’t have the money [to pay the smugglers]. We ate only once a day. There was a lot of beating, with stones, sticks, and pipes. The smugglers killed two people who were trying to escape. I saw it. It was a boy and a girl, running away, and the men with guns shot at them. They shot them in the belly, everything came out.

Fahad’s family sold its plot of land to come up with the $3,800 that would finally free him to move onward to the Libyan coast.

According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 65 percent of the 224,000 people who reached the southern shores of Europe in the first seven months of the year were from Syria, Eritrea, Afghanistan and Somalia. Many of them have stories similar to the ones we’ve heard.

Stepped up search-and-rescue efforts in the Mediterranean have made a difference, but the EU should commit to sustaining such initiatives over the long term to avoid future deaths at sea. It also should shift its focus from trying to prevent or discourage people attempting to make the dangerous crossing, and acknowledge the human rights violations driving dangerous migration — particularly after July’s record-breaking 110,000 refugee arrivals.

EU leaders have endorsed a “European Agenda on Migration.” If implemented fully — and more generously — the plan could help ensure safer access to international protection in the EU. However, most of the agenda involves reinforcing measures to limit arrivals, rather than create more safe and legal channels into European Union countries.

In July, EU countries pledged to resettle more than 22,500 recognized refugees from other regions of the world, an increase over the commission’s proposal of 20,000, and a big improvement over the mere 8,579 resettled by combined 28 EU member states in 2014. Even so, the new pledge is makes up less than 20 percent of the UN refugee agency’s estimated global resettlement needs for 2015. The truth is that there is little appetite for helping those in need by, say, facilitating family reunification, or increasing the use of humanitarian visas to enable people to travel lawfully to the EU to apply for asylum or other forms of protection.

There are no easy solutions here. But EU leaders should endorse measures to increase safe and legal channels into the EU and ensure decent and fair treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, in every country in the union.

They should also ensure that all measures to combat irregular migration are grounded in respect for human rights and dignity, including the right to leave one’s own country, the right to seek asylum and protection against receiving countries returning anyone to a country where their lives or freedoms may be at risk.

Over the long term, the EU and other receiving countries as well should use their influence and resources more effectively to address the major drivers of migration, including systematic human rights violations, poverty, inequitable development, weak governance and violent conflict and lawlessness.

As 21-year-old Asmeron said when we asked him why he left Eritrea, “With no rights, it’s difficult to stay.”"

But I was still outraged and upset from the night before. The feeling of disaster suspends time. It’s a feeling I’m starting to become familiar with, one of being haunted by violence. Not just as a Palestinian and a resident of Paris but as a humanist concerned with all things unjust. By Saturday, I was getting used to the idea that this world, the apocalyptic traditions of this world, will not do justice to our planet.

About an hour after news reports of the attacks broke, Facebook activated its Safety Check, a feature previously applied only to earthquakes and typhoons. By then, I had left my apartment, clutching my phone with a melancholy grip, refreshing my Facebook feed every minute. In a span of two hours, hundreds of my Paris-based friends checked in safely or had been checked in safely by a friend.

My phone doesn’t beep with messages from my family as it did last year when Gaza was being bombed by Israel. I am the one who has to ping my friends in Paris, who has to text my partner, asking him to check up on our friends whose numbers I don’t have and who live in the neighborhoods the attackers targeted. I scroll my newsfeed reading one status update after another from friends responding to people like me, frantic and checking on loved ones.

Last Thursday in Beirut, when the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for yet another one of its signature soft-targeted attacks, I didn’t rush to social media to ascertain the safety of my friends or family. None of them lived in the working-class district of Burj al-Barajneh where the suicide bombings took place. And last year when the Israeli military attacked Gaza, where my father’s family is from and where I have half-brothers and -sisters, cousins and aunts, the idea of their checking in on Facebook regarding their safety is a thought that never would have crossed my mind, much less their minds.

In Paris, a place I called home for several years, my friends are all safe. I know they are, because that’s what Facebook tells me. Its Safety Check feature is meant to “connect friends and loved ones during a natural disaster,” according to the company. Safety Check allows users to check in online, letting users know if our friends were in the affected area of a disaster.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will activate the Safety Check feature for ‘other serious and tragic incidents of the future.’ But who will deem what is serious or tragic enough?

Arab apocalypse

In 1980, Etel Adnan, a seminal Lebanese painter and poet, wrote “The Arab Apocalypse,” a series of poems written on her typewriter and surrounded by hieroglyph-like symbols of the sun and mountains or arrows and swirls that resemble the abstract paintings for which she is known. She gave me a copy when I met her last year in Paris, just before I left for Brooklyn in New York. It was a book that she began writing in 1975, two months before the outbreak of Lebanon’s civil war. Then the war started, and Tal-el-Zaatar, a Palestinian refugee camp, was under siege for 59 days. As a response, she picked up the book again and added 59 pages filled with doom and destruction.

“It’s the only thing that made sense for me to do,” she told me from her Paris apartment.

I pulled my copy of “The Arab Apocalypse” from my bookshelf and leafed through its pages, thinking about my Paris days. As I write, my Facebook feed is filled with anger over what happened in France, not to mention Lebanon and Baghdad. The death toll rises, and everyone has something to say — a prayer, an analysis, a conspiracy theory. “When Beirut was under attack,” a friend wrote, “we didn’t have a safe button to make sure our loved ones were safe.”

I start to imagine what it would be like to have a “safe” button in 1970s Beirut or during the two intifadas in occupied Palestine. Even now in Palestinian cities, in Haifa and Nazareth, where my friends are afraid to speak Arabic for fear of getting attacked by Israeli extremists, I think of how a “safe” button would give solace to parents whose children attend Israeli universities or daughters whose blue-collar fathers work in West Jerusalem, some of them going as far as disguising themselves as Jewish by wearing a yarmulke. I think, why don’t they get to have a “safe” button? Shouldn’t safety be a universal right?

In response to criticism that Facebook used the safety check feature for Paris but not Beirut, the company’s vice president of growth, Alex Schultz, said, “There has to be a first time for trying something new.” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will activate the feature for “other serious and tragic incidents of the future.” But who will deem what is serious or tragic enough?

Of course, the double standards go beyond questions of a safety check in places where disaster has struck. Facebook, with its profile filter that can instantly apply the French flag over users’ photos, is telling us that solidarity and mourning are selective. And that safety is a privilege not for the Arab world.

Even though the Beirut and Paris attacks were only one day apart, President Barack Obama issued just one statement. And even though both ISIL-led attacks were against civilians, only one set, according to him, was an “attack against all humanity.” (On Sunday in Turkey he called the Paris assaults an attack “on the civilized world” — because, of course, Beirut is not a civilized place.)

As a Facebook friend in London wrote on her wall, “Those other places are ‘political,’ and their victims cannot be invoked in the supposedly ‘neutral’ milieu of Facebook.” Because our humanity has been amputated by the apocalypse. Because Arabs aren’t traumatized from burying enough of their dead. Because it’s Paris, it hurts more.

Because the world is telling us that this is an Arab apocalypse. It is supposed to be safe only for some."

Why were they so quick to forgive? The families were simply exercising a fundamental Christian virtue. In so doing, they possibly changed the South forever in the process as Confederate flags and symbols are removed from state buildings across the South.

When we suffer injustice, the human heart craves revenge, vindication and retaliation. These are also desires Christ came to save us from. Christians are commanded to respond to injustice with forgiveness. This principle is central to Jesus’ teaching in the Lord’s Prayer: “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.” (Matt 6:12). Immediately after this prayer, Jesus tells his disciples, “For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” (Matthew 6:14–15)

Later in the Gospel of Matthew, Peter asks Jesus, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?” Jesus answers, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.” (Matthew 18:21–22) In other words, you cannot forgive someone enough.

The swift forgiveness offered by the victims’ families, as hard as that must have been, is what Christianity is all about. Forgiveness is an extension of love. Christians extend forgiving love to those who have wronged them — including their enemies — because this is God’s disposition toward them. God is love, and he calls his people to love. God forgives first and expects his people to do the same.

The grace of forgiveness, in turn, empowers forgiven people to forgive others. The irony, of course, is that the very act of Emanuel AME members welcoming a white man into their Bible study showed their deep orientation toward love, given that the AME denomination was birthed from white Christians committing unloving and unwelcoming acts against African-Americans in majority-white congregations."

The vote comes amid international scrutiny over the integrity of the country’s electoral process. The U.S. government, the Organization of American States (OAS) and human rights groups have all called for credible elections. Some in the U.S. media have already indicted the elections’ validity.

But these critics ignore the fact that thousands of domestic observers and hundreds of international monitors from the Union of South American Nations and other groups have already signed on to oversee the elections. It is clear that much of the diplomatic posturing is not meant to protect Venezuela’s electoral integrity but to further delegitimize the government of President Nicolás Maduro.

No election system is perfect, but Venezuela has one of the most efficient, secure and transparent electoral systems. “The election process in Venezuela is the best in the world,” said former President Jimmy Carter in 2012 — praise echoed by other neutral observers.

Venezuelan voters use electronic machines, which print out a paper receipt that allows voters to check their choices against the electronic ballot. After voting has ended, 54 percent of machines are audited at random, in the presence of witnesses from pro-government and opposition political parties, and compared with a tally of paper receipts. The National Electoral Council (CNE) has implemented additional safeguards and audits, making the process more inclusive than ever before, with 96.5 percent of eligible Venezuelans registered to vote (compared with fewer than 76 percent of eligible Americans).

With the support of the Carter Center (a nonprofit organization run by Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter) and other pro-democracy groups, Venezuela has developed strong, independent national observation groups. “Despite refusal of the CNE to allow substantial international observation, its relationship with domestic observers has actually improved,” according to David Smilde, a senior fellow at the advocacy group Washington Office on Latin America. “They have been granted almost twice as many credentials as they had three years ago, which improves their capacity.”

After having international observers in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the CNE decided in 2007 to no longer welcome observation by the OAS. It noted that the OAS, the European Union, the Carter Center and other international observers had repeatedly affirmed the integrity of Venezuela’s electoral system. So the electoral authority replaced the observer missions with a system of international accompaniment — perceived as more respectful of Venezuela’s sovereignty — while strengthening national observation.

Venezuela is not the only country to refuse OAS observation. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Canada and the United States have all opted out. Unlike Venezuela, the U.S. faces serious questions about voter suppression, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision gutting the Voting Rights Act, and concerns about its aging voting machines.

The OAS knows that Venezuela is not amenable to its observer mission. The new OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro has been far more antagonistic to Maduro’s government than his predecessors were. His antipathy was exemplified by an uncharacteristically harsh 18-page letter he sent to the head of the CNE, Tibisay Lucena, on Nov. 10. The letter lamented that the transparency and fairness of the poll will not be guaranteed without OAS observation. The U.S. government applauded the letter in a move that further endangered progress toward rapprochement between the two countries."

The investigation into that attack has been so thoroughly mismanaged by the Mexican state that an international panel of experts working for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recently declared that the narrative of events constructed by the Mexican Attorney General’s office was, in a word, impossible. At every turn over the last year, it seems, the Mexican federal government has obfuscated the truth of what happened that night — so much so that Amnesty International has called the government’s actions in response to the report a “desperate cover-up strategy.”

There are a number of explanations for the heartless ineptitude of the Mexican state over the past year: high levels of corruption and deep ties to the drug cartels within the government; partisan politics and the need to protect members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI; and the power afforded to the Mexican military in the U.S.-backed war on drugs. All are important aspects of this story. But the reaction of the Mexican government to the disappearance betrays a motivation closer to the surface: President Enrique Peña Nieto has made clear from his first day in office that his top priority is security for foreign investors, rather than for the Mexican people. But this strategy has produced devastating human rights consequences. What’s more, it isn’t even working to improve the Mexican economy.

When Peña Nieto was inaugurated in December of 2012, it was behind thick security walls protected by cordons of riot police, designed to keep out the thousands of protestors who had gathered in the streets of Mexico City. His promises to bring peace and prosperity — to create a “new” Mexico — were met with understandable skepticism from those who distrusted his party, the PRI.

The PRI had run Mexico as an effective single-party state for seven decades before a democratic opening in 2000 brought the center-right National Action Party (PAN) to power. But under PAN leadership, a militarized war on the drug cartels led to a deepening crisis that left more than 100,000 Mexicans dead and thousands more forcibly disappeared. On inauguration night, Peña Nieto assured Mexicans — the 38 percent who had voted for him, and the majority who had not — that those days were behind them. He would, he promised, change Mexico’s image in the world, make it a destination for investment from abroad and bring a new era of growth to the country.

To fulfill his promise, Peña Nieto pushed through a series of highly controversial economic reforms meant to undermine the power of labor unions, break up communications monopolies and, most strikingly, open Mexican oil fields to foreign investment for the first time since the 1930s."

But in the days leading up to Sunday’s elections, it is here that the biggest battle for the future of Greece and Europe is taking place: Mytilene is the site of a massive wave of people trying to reach Europe.

These are the refugees whose lives Greek and European forthcoming policy choices will affect. Until their fate is decided, hundreds of refugees are sitting under trees in the blistering afternoon sun.

Sept. 20 will be the third time Greeks go to the ballot this year, if you include the July 5 referendum over whether to accept further austerity measures demanded by the troika — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Polls show that left-wing Syriza and center-right New Democracy are in the lead, but surveys vary, and the winner is still very hard to predict. Though the incumbent parties have clung to their popularity, this vote will be very different: Greeks are voting not just on the economic policies that will shape their lives but also on the future of the Syrians and Afghan refugees lining up outside ticket offices, hoping to secure passage on the next ferry to mainland Greece on their way to Western and Northern Europe. There, closed borders, fences and tear gas await them as a growing number of refugees scramble toward a better life in Germany, Sweden and elsewhere.

Last week Hungary greeted a group of Syrian refugees trying to reach Germany with water cannons and tear gas. A video shot by a passenger shows the Turkish coast guard using a a water cannon on a dinghy full of refugees crossing from Turkey. Incidents like these are taking place across the routes that refugees are using, and they reflect a toughening stance by governments like that of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has taken it on himself to block those fleeing conflict, torture and death from reaching a better life, in the name of an imaginary, besieged Christian Europe.

The same rhetoric has taken hold in the Czech Republic and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and its consequences are tearing the European Union apart. The financial crisis and the negotiations between Greece and its lenders brought an end to the free movement of capital within the EU (Greece is still imposing capital controls); now Germany and other countries are bringing back border checks, ending the freedom of movement that defined the idea of the EU almost from the start. As the violation of basic human rights in refugee holding facilities across the continent is tolerated, the EU of solidarity exists only in the imagination of Brussels officials.

While Germany has sped up the processing asylum seekers and takes care of Syrian refugees with a rather generous welfare package on arrival, its initial promise to accept 800,000 people this year was quietly abandoned after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s announcement proved too controversial. With the excuse that “too many are coming,” Germany quickly reimposed border controls. As is the case across the EU, the motive to keep foreigners out is therefore largely political.

In Greece the national dialogue has long focused on austerity politics and economics. This can’t go on — not least because there is little left for Greeks to lose. Austerity is now an uncompromisable reality. It will be harsh and will almost definitely hit those who are already worse off even harder. Politicians from most of the main parties are now simply arguing who will manage it better."

It was the first direct communication between these leaders since February, and both the Kremlin and the White House reported that the conversation ranged over the Ukraine crisis, the civil wars in Syria and Iraq and the NATO buildup in Eastern Europe, as well as the impending conclusion of the talks with Iran over suspect nuclear weapons. Putin initiated the exchange, but Obama did all of the asserting and exhorting that, in the end, came to a standoff in all the threatened regions. Chiefly, Obama is said to have insisted upon actions by Putin without offering anything in exchange. Obama’s conduct, according to Kremlin informants, was a premeditated performance of ultimatum.

Demands and provocations

First, Obama pressed Putin with the claim that Russia must withdraw from Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula. The White House reported Obama’s remarks in terms of last February’s Minsk agreement between the so-called Normandy Four, Ukraine, France, Germany and Russia: “President Obama reiterated the need for Russia to fulfill its commitments under the Minsk agreements, including the removal of all Russian troops and equipment from Ukrainian territory.” At no point before or after that agreement has the Kremlin acknowledged there are Russian troops or weapon systems inside Ukraine in support of the Donbass separatists. There is no language in the agreement saying that there exist Russian armed forces in Ukraine to be withdrawn. There is mention of “foreign armed formations, military equipment, and also mercenaries.” Since then, the U.S. has deployed both military units and military equipment into Ukraine in support of the Kiev government. Kiev claims it has deployed 60,000 troops along the Donbass cease-fire line. The U.S., Great Britain and Canada speak of sending trainers for the elite national guard units (though not the neo-fascist Azov Battalion). Obama’s remarks to Putin about Ukraine took the form of a diktat. From the Russian point of view, Obama sounded peculiarly unrealistic. There was the suggestion of desperation in Obama’s demands in order to create a foreign policy legacy despite the disorder in Europe, the Middle East and East Asia. Obama also demanded that Russia support the pending deal between the P5+1 powers — the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany — and Iran over Tehran’s suspected secret nuclear weapons program. Russia, a party to the negotiations, has not voiced its opinion of a deal yet to be concluded. Obama told Putin that Russia must go along with the deal because this is what the international community demands.

The two presidents ended their call where they had started, with adamant positions that speak to distrust and disdain.

The Kremlin is as fretful about the Iranian nuclear program as any other power. Russia’s heartland is well within Iran’s ballistic missile range, but it is also within China’s, India’s and Pakistan’s. The Kremlin worries less about whether or not Iran has nukes than about who in Tehran has the finger on the button. Russia has long voiced its hope that Iran will turn back to its Persian heritage as a peaceful neighbor, and away from the apocalyptic Mahdists such as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps leadership. Obama also demanded that Russia quit its support for the besieged Bashar al-Assad regime in Damascus. Obama wants Assad out of the way so that the so-called rebels, who include the Al Qaeda-backed Al Nusra Front, can concentrate on fighting the anarchistic Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Russia has shown much doubt about Assad’s survival recently, but as of now Russia continues to provide technical and material support for Damascus and for Assad’s only sponsor, Tehran. Obama also warned Putin of harsh consequences if Russia reacts belligerently to the deployment of U.S. weaponry to the nations bordering the Russian frontier, from the Baltic states to Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Last week, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced in Tallinn, Estonia, that the US would deploy tanks, artillery, and equipment suited for a combat brigade of 3,000-5,000 troops. “These are responses to Russia’s provocations,” Carter said. In sharp contrast, Putin’s chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, indicated just days before Carter’s announcement that Russia regards NATO as a provocateur. “And we hear now that heavy weaponry has to be deployed, “Ivanov told the Financial Times, “which is forbidden under the NATO-Russian Founding Act of 1997, not to mention the promise which was given to us much earlier that NATO would not expand to the east at all. They are expanding very much!”

But many foreigners had far more luck as members of Global Rescue, a company committed to rescuing its clients from dangerous environments. “Why shouldn’t we be able to hire private armies to ensure our safe return home from vacation?” posed a recent article in Wired, headlined “The tricky ethics of the lucrative disaster rescue business.”

Global Rescue is booming, opening offices in Pakistan, Thailand and beyond. There’s nothing illegal about its operations, and its mandate makes a certain amount of sense: Anybody in the middle of a natural disaster would want to be helped immediately. But the corporation’s interests aren’t humanitarian — they’re profit-driven, with an annual membership costing approximately $700. In Nepal, limited numbers of helicopters were fought over to transport injured foreigners, while the vast majority of Nepalese had no choice but to wait for help from overwhelmed relief services. “It’s beyond our scope” to assist those locals trapped on snowy mountains, said Drew Pache, a Global Rescue employee and former U.S. special forces operative.

It’s hard to find a better characterization of disaster capitalism than this — companies making money off catastrophe from the privileged few while ignoring the desperate pleas of the majority. But it’s not just natural disaster that fuels such profiteering. From Greece and Papua New Guinea to Afghanistan and Haiti, countless industries are thriving by applying this rule to immigration, war, mining and aid. These businesses aren’t conducted secretively, in part because it’s nearly impossible to hold an American company to account if it breaches human rights in a faraway nation. Their success builds on an ideology, empowered by the existing political and media structures, that exploits the widespread anxiety or panic that follows a man-made or natural crisis. Companies such as Global Rescue thrive because of it. The process depends on powerful forces pushing through exploitative policies in the name of relief, progress or reform.

Further profits are being harvested from Europe’s refugee crisis. In Britain, the private outsourcing company Serco still runs the Yarl’s Wood immigration center, a facility with a shocking record of abuse against detainees. Despite this being known for years, David Cameron’s Conservative government reappointed the multinational firm in late 2014 with another eight-year contract. It makes no sense — I visited the center last year and found depression and bleakness — unless we view it through the grim lens of disaster capitalism. Companies such as Serco exploit the refugee crisis in Libya and Syria to bully and fund politicians and guarantee an increase in their bottom line. Serco is savvy enough to see dollar signs from the guaranteed exodus of people — and in turn, today’s political system, fueled by excessive money and donations, all but ensures this outcome.

The profit motive for firms isn’t a new phenomenon. Recall the East India Co., arguably one of the world’s first disaster capitalists, which oppressed Indian and Chinese locals to become leading corporate raiders. But the global reach of today’s companies and their extravagant takings place them in a unique and often unassailable position."

There were serious street demonstrations, condemnations from human rights organizations, religious leaders, business groups and the refusal of seven other presidential candidates from the first round to accept another episode of illegitimate elections. They had plenty of arguments and evidence on their side. In the first round of the presidential election, held on Oct. 25, local observers found massive irregularities and evidence of fraud. More than 900,000 observer credentials were distributed to political party representatives — effectively allowing them to vote multiple times. International reporters witnessed these passes being sold on the black market. In an election where only about 1.6 million people (26 percent of the electorate) voted, the legitimacy of the vote became doubtful.

Célestin was also the candidate who finished second in the first round of Haiti’s 2010 presidential elections. But the “international community” had a different choice, and brought in an “expert” mission under the auspices of the Organization of American States to examine the results. Without a recount or even a statistical test of a ballot sample, it reversed the first-round results, eliminating Célestin and putting musician and businessman Michel Martelly into the runoff. Martelly went on to win the election and become president. Approaching the end of his five-year term, he is supporting Moïse as his replacement.

How did this happen? Basically, Haitians managed to put Washington in the situation of having to maintain that a runoff election with only one candidate, businessman Jovenel Moïse, would be legitimate, or postpone the election. As late as last Thursday, just three days before the election, U.S. officials were insisting that they would go forward even if the second candidate, engineer Jude Célestin, refused to participate. But he stuck to his boycott, and they backed down.

Perhaps this is nowhere more true than in Haiti, where Washington has long exercised a veto over the country’s most important decisions. But last week the “international community” suffered a rare defeat when Haitians rejected Washington’s plans for a deeply flawed presidential runoff election to take place on Sunday, Jan. 24.

Journalists are taught in school to avoid euphemisms. When someone dies, they write that she “died” instead of “passed away.” But one euphemism that has become a fixture in U.S. news reporting is “the international community.” This is generally a substitute for the U.S. government, with or without some input from some of its allies.

It was even tougher to accept the election results after a commission appointed by Martelly found that only 8 percent of tally sheets that they examined were free from irregularities. The opposition did not all have the same demands but they wanted a new electoral council to lead the process and some reforms to make sure that the second round would be credible. Many observers have also demanded a serious examination of the first-round ballots to see if there was any basis for accepting the results.

No date for new elections has yet been set, and it remains to be seen what will happen when Martelly’s term expires on Feb. 7.

The current fight for legitimate elections in Haiti is another episode of a long struggle for democracy that goes back to the U.S.-backed dictatorships of François and Jean-Claude Duvalier (1957-1986) and the overthrow of the country’s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 1991 and again in 2004 (with decisive support from Washington). And even further back, it is rooted in Haiti’s many conflicts with “the international community” since the country’s founding in 1804 from a slave rebellion, including its occupation by U.S. Marines from 1915 to 1934.

Today’s electoral turmoil shows how much continuity there is with this awful history. In a sense, the country remains occupied today by United Nations troops who were brought in not to help with reconstruction after the 2010 earthquake — as many people mistakenly believe — but six years earlier, to “keep order” after the constitutional government was overthrown, its officials jailed or forced into exile, and thousands of supporters killed.

It would be remiss not to mention the institutional racism that allows for such continuity. This is most painfully obvious in the response of “the international community” to a problem that they themselves created just five years ago: the cholera epidemic that has killed nearly 10,000 Haitians and infected hundreds of thousands more. Cholera had not been present in Haiti until some UN troops — not “aid workers” as some people alleged — dumped their human feces into the country’s water supply in 2010. Yet they refuse to come up with the money that would be necessary to provide clean water and resolve the problem, even though they have spent much more than this on maintaining their military presence in the country.

It is hard to see such twisted priorities as other than a statement that “Black lives don’t matter.” As with the elections, and USAID reconstruction funds of which only 1.6 percent went to Haitian organizations and companies, it seems that even in dealing with a deadly disease caused by these foreign governments’ own gross negligence, power and control over the country are the first priorities."

At least 121 people, including children, have been detained since the New Year’s weekend in the first large-scale deportations of refugees from Central America’s troubled Northern Triangle. The nationwide raids are sending waves of fear in an already vulnerable and terrorized population, many of whom suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression.

The targeted roundups follow a surge in the number of migrants crossing the Southwest border in recent months. At least 10,000 unaccompanied children from Central America migrated across the border in October and November alone. But deporting women and children fleeing mayhem and misery back to the perilous conditions they fled is misguided and inhumane. Most are refugees trying to escape horrific levels of gang and gender-related violence and are entitled to humanitarian protection, yet little is being done to protect their rights.

The Barack Obama administration’s unrelenting efforts to turn refugees back have not deterred their inflow. More women and children are expected to flee in 2016 because they continue to be imperiled at home. Instead of cracking down on families, the U.S. should honor its domestic and international obligations to protect their rights, and re-orient its policies toward ameliorating the deplorable conditions in the Northern Triangle.

On Jan. 4, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson defended the raids as an effort to secure the U.S. border, touting “the largest deployment of vehicles, aircraft, boats, and equipment along the southwest border in the 90-year history of the Border Patrol.” But asylum seekers pose no threat to national security that warrants such an unprecedented deployment of resources. The renewed push appears to be in part a strategic gambit for Democrats eager to establish credibility on immigration enforcement, and to avoid a new surge of migrants next summer as the presidential election looms.

Johnson insisted that “our borders are not open to illegal migration,” highlighting his misapprehension of the fact that refugees are legally entitled to present themselves at the border and seek protections, which Washington is bound to provide. However, the administration’s immigration procedures evince disregard for those rights.

Many of the migrants who received deportation orders were subjected to an accelerated court-hearing schedule dubbed “rocket dockets,” which often pose insurmountable hurdles for those who have legitimate claims. Legal representation would greatly enhance their chances of a favorable decision, but given the expedited process and the dearth of legal resources, few were represented by a competent attorney. Some were ordered removed in absentia even after DHS failed to provide them with adequate information, translation and notice about the hearings. The procedural flaws only intensify fear and mistrust, forcing migrants further into the shadows."

Trump continuously defends his outlandish statements, responding to criticism with different iterations of “I’m so tired of this politically correct crap” — suggesting, in other words, that the problem is not his overt racism, but an intolerant society of overly sensitive liberals who violate his freedom of speech.

Trump’s recent call to ban Muslims from entering the United States enraged Democrats and Republicans, and even elicited criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Trump is relentless in his bigotry, and has declared a war on political correctness, using his presidential campaign as its first offensive.

His war is escalating, nearly unabated; although his hateful slurs are despicable, they’re perfectly legal in the U.S. A nearly all-encompassing defense of speech, enshrined in the First Amendment, is a cornerstone of the American legal system. The amendment serves as a check on government overreach, allowing citizens to freely criticize those in power without fear of repercussion. That promotes a culture of debate, characterized by protest and disagreement. Long-serving Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, an ardent defender of the First Amendment, famously described its protection against exceptions to the rule, saying that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech” means “no law.”

But that system is not universally revered. It has obvious costs: Tolerating bigoted speech means that people — particularly the marginalized — often get hurt. The alternative means taking punitive measures. Earlier this year, brothers at the University of Oklahoma fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon were filmed chanting, “There will never be a nigger [at] SAE, you can hang him from a tree.” Two of them were subsequently expelled — the rest were disciplined and the fraternity was closed — prompting outcry from lawyers who argued that, as a public institution, the university had violated the First Amendment.

But for many, the students’ reference to lynching was a chilling echo of a dark past, and should be rejected. After the incident, Kent Greenfield, a professor at Boston College Law School, wrote that embracing the right to chant racist slogans is a “bloated” and “ham-fisted” interpretation of the First Amendment that should compel us to rethink its meaning.

The students’ expulsion may have sent that message, and was generally popular among students. Still, opponents cited numerous court rulings that disallow universities from disciplining students based on speech. It later came to light that the students had learned the racist chant years prior at a national fraternity event; an investigation showed that it had been an institutionalized part of fraternity culture for the last 50 years. At the time, some argued that the expulsions offered a swift way to postpone addressing deeper issues of racism on campus.

In other countries, the Oklahoma expulsion would have been a no-brainer, and Trump’s hate speech would certainly not fly. France is a good example. When National Front politician Anne-Sophie Leclère compared Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, a black woman, to a chimpanzee, she received a nine-month prison term and a 50,000 euro fine. The penalty is currently under review, but the mere fact that she was tried for her racist remarks — and handed a clearly disproportionate sentence — is indicative of France’s interventionist free-speech regime."

Black students and their friends and allies protested for Brown and Garner on campuses last year too. At Princeton University, where I teach, nearly 500 students participated in campus protests following the non-indictments.

But recently, the protests have turned inward — toward a campus climate that many African-American students describe as hostile, indifferent and, at times, contemptuous of their presence. Despite vocal efforts to minimize the nature of the protests, thousands of African-American students have been protesting and demonstrating on college campuses — large and small, public and private — across the country. At Princeton, many of the same students who stood up to police violence are now confronting the administration’s continued honoring of Woodrow Wilson, the former president of both Princeton and the United States, who was also a virulent and unrepentant racist.

The responses to these campus protests have ranged from sympathy and solidarity to incredulity and anger. Some in the media have portrayed black students as coddled, fragile or entitled, always with the implication that they are overreacting to trivial issues. The common assumption is that black students, especially those on Ivy League campuses, have nothing to complain about.

But these protests are not only about the conditions black students encounter on campus. They are also shaped by their complicated experiences coming of age during the presidency of Barack Obama. When Obama was first elected in 2008, Americans of all backgrounds were tantalized by the promise of living in a post-racial or colorblind society. Unfortunately, those expectations have been shattered repeatedly.

The idea that black students should just be quiet and enjoy their supposedly privileged lives overlooks the reality that even solidly middle-class African-Americans often face economic insecurities and inequality that their white peers do not.

Under Obama, few demographics have faced more uncertainty than the African-American middle class. There are many reasons for this, but a central one is the collapse of black homeownership following the 2008 financial crisis. According to one report, a staggering 240,000 African-Americans lost their homes to foreclosure between 2007 and 2009. Furthermore, high-earning African-Americans were 80 percent more likely to lose their homes than their white counterparts. The devastation of black middle class enclaves like Prince George’s County, Maryland, due to home foreclosures was far more severe than that facing the white middle class.

The foreclosure crisis has had a domino effect on the financial health and prospects of the black middle class. The disparity between black and white net worth, driven largely by homeownership, exemplifies the differences between the experiences of the white middle class and their black counterparts. In 2011, the median white household had $111,146 in wealth holdings compared to the paltry $7,113 for African-American families."

Rare is the rom-com blockbuster that deviates much from the traditional script: Man meets woman (who is effortlessly beautiful, but also the girl next door). Man is not totally interested, for fairly mundane reasons. But after lots of buildup and “duh” moments, man realizes woman is the one. In the movies, last-minute love is everlasting and almost always wins. The saccharine, feel-good moments will drive any skeptic bonkers, and the relationships among gender, desire and expectations are overwhelmingly outdated. Yet somehow, we can’t stop watching these movies — perhaps with the hope that this time it will be different.

“Trainwreck,” written by and starring the current patron saint of feminist comedy, Amy Schumer, purports to flip the rom-com script by making Schumer’s character, Amy, commitment-phobic and her love interest, Aaron, played by Bill Hader, steadily pro-relationship. And who better to rewrite the script of traditional rom-coms? Schumer’s Comedy Central show, “Inside Amy Schumer,” engages critically with topics such as beauty standards, the male gaze and sexuality while still managing to be really funny. Although “Trainwreck” — the title a knowing nod toward the social tendency to prescriptively judge and label women’s behavior — has feminist moments, it nonetheless follows the patterns of traditional rom-coms, including at the end, when the guy gets the girl (or in this case, the girl gets the guy). Which raises the question, Is it even possible for a rom-com to radicalize romance?

At first glance, we appear to be well on our way. There has been a recent uptick in the number of rom-coms that depict a more diverse vision of the standard female protagonist. She is no longer a woman vying for romance but an independent women who is ambivalent about finding love. Amy in “Trainwreck” is a great example of this: She’s into her career, has sex like a man, has major intimacy issues (she hates when guys sleep over after sex) and isn’t particularly nice or sweet. Similarly, the protagonist in “Bridesmaids,” Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig), is an honest portrayal of a woman who isn’t ready to get married; she’s also a bit of a mess and is devastated that her best friend (Maya Rudolph) is getting married.

While directors and writers have become adept at infusing the rom-com formula with feminist humor and self-aware criticisms of the genre, few of them are able to break from the script of the happy couple at the end. Though these movies gave us a vision of something different, their main characters largely end up finding a romantic partner. And even in these cinematic attempts to uphold alternate modes of romantic fulfillment, it’s hard to imagine that those storylines are possible in real life for someone who is not like the protagonist — white or thin.

After all, in real life, romance doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s shaped by social expectations and their influence on our desires, from a reliance on patriarchal notions such as chivalry or the arrival of a Prince Charming to the barriers that stand between many of us — based on where we live, what we look like or how the world perceives us — and actually living our romantic dreams."

The paper expanded on Gilens’ earlier work and was widely lauded in the press, with the two authors appearing on “The Daily Show.” But as shocking as their findings were, new evidence suggests that the superrich may have even more divergent opinions from average Americans’ and that these gaps may help explain the rise of reactionary politicians such as Donald Trump. Trump’s extended lead in GOP presidential polling has come as quite a surprise to Beltway journalists. However, new data from a 2012 survey that includes a relatively large sample of high-income individuals suggest one reason for the divide: The richest of the rich have dramatically different views from average Americans’. Gilens provided me with the following data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), a 50,000-person survey with a large sample of wealthy individuals. The sample included 118 individuals whose annual income was over $500,000, 171 who earned $350,000 to $499,999 and 343 earning $250,000 to $349,999. The median annual income in the U.S. is $52,000, and an income of $385,195 is enough to put an individual in the top 1 percent. The data provided by Gilens suggest startling divides between the rich and the rest of Americans on issues related to budgets and redistribution. To begin with, there’s the hotly contested Bowles-Simpson budget — a proposal from the 2010 National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform created by President Barack Obama and chaired by Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson. The CCES informed the people it polled that the budget would reduce the debt by 21 percent by 2020 by cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and defense spending by 15 percent and by eliminating tax breaks for individuals and corporations. The budget was supported by a bipartisan group of politicians and heavily promoted by mainstream media. New York Times columnist David Brooks, for instance, claimed that Bowles-Simpson would “lay the foundation for decades of prosperity” and “galvanize a new-center left majority.” The problem is that the plan fails to find favor with Americans in general. On average, 49 percent of Americans support Bowles-Simpson and 51 percent oppose it when its essential features are described in survey questions. These gaps are strongly defined by class. Among those earning less than $30,000 a year, only 41 percent support it, while among those earning $500,000 or more, support was 72 percent.

A more draconian budget supported by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, which, the CCES informed respondents, “would cut Medicare and Medicaid by 42 percent” and “would reduce debt by 16 percent by 2020,” also produced divergent responses. Only 18 percent of the full sample supported the Ryan plan, but among those earning $250,000 or more, support was 31 percent. Among those earning less than $30,000, only 13 percent supported the Ryan budget, compared with 36 percent of those earning $500,000 or more.

One CCES question asked whether survey subjects supported extending the Tax Hike Prevention Act, which would renew President George W. Bush’s tax cuts on all earners. Though presented as cuts that benefit all Americans, data suggest that the tax cuts are heavily favorable toward the wealthy, with 30 percent of the tax cuts going to the richest 1 percent. On that question, again, there were deep class divides. Among those earning less than $30,000 a year, 24 percent of respondents supported extending the Bush tax cuts. Among those earning $500,000 or more, 43 percent did. On average, support for full extension of the Bush tax cuts stood at just 26 percent, while among those earning $250,000 or more, it was 37 percent.

These data supplement a working paper (which I’ve written about for Al Jazeera America) by political scientists Jesse Rhodes and Brian Schaffner. They found that Republican members of Congress are “more strongly associated with the ideological predispositions of individuals in higher wealth brackets” while Democrats are less strongly associated with millionaires. Rhodes and Schaffner also found that “millionaires receive about twice as much representation when they comprise just 5 percent of the district’s population [as] the poorest wealth group does when it makes up 50 percent of the district.” In addition, Rhodes and Schaffner highlighted important divides between the rich and average Americans.

Fraudulent democracy goes a long way to accounting for the appeal of populism across the ideological spectrum."

In the centuries that have passed since the Pilgrims first dined with the Wampanoag at Plymouth, the gulf separating Native and non-Native Americans has become huge, thanks to war, disease, genocide and countless harmful policies inflicted on Natives.

Today, Native people account for roughly 2 percent of the U.S. population. Roughly 22 percent live on reservations or related regions. New York City is the urban area with the most Native Americans, but at 111,749 residents, Natives make up less than 2 percent of the country’s largest city.

Outside of some sparsely populated Western states, most Natives and non-Natives have few, if any, opportunities to interact. Absent contact with actual Natives, most Americans are left with negative images that are mired in myths from the past, such as feathered headdresses and tomahawks, and tainted with more recent stereotypes, such as casinos and alcoholism. The “Indian” mascots displayed so proudly by sports teams such as the Washington Redskins, the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago Blackhawks perpetuate caricatures that are inaccurate and hurtful.

Years ago, when my children were young, this really hit home for me. I had been welcomed warmly by a handful of Native Americans on the Menominee reservation, during the early stages of what has become a decades-long collaboration involving Northwestern University, where I am a professor, and Native communities. Together, we have been working to understand how children’s understanding of the natural world unfolds across development and across cultures.

When I returned home from that first meeting, as I began to tell my children about my day, the youngest interrupted to ask, “Mommy! Did they have feathers?” This stopped me in my tracks. As she tried to envision my story, this was the clearest image of an Indian that came to her mind.

More recently, at a community meeting at the American Indian Center in Chicago, the Chicago Blackhawks, who had just won hockey’s Stanley Cup, were a topic of discussion. After looking at their mascot, a young Native child leaned over to her mother and asked, “Why don’t I look like an Indian?”"

From farmers in California to brewers in Colorado and fishermen in Montana, water is a part of everything we do. But our water is scarce, so we know not to put our limited water resources at risk.

Unfortunately, reckless mining companies have been doing just that for more than a century. As we saw in Colorado last week, mining for gold and other hard rock minerals can create toxic mixes of acid and metals that threaten our rivers and drinking water supplies. In Colorado, the Gold King mine released over 3 million gallons of mine pollution, affecting some 100 river miles in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah and countless people along the way.

What many headlines failed to mention is that the Gold King mine is not unique. The West is plagued with hundreds of thousands of similar old mines, long forgotten and unused. Many of these mines are pollution traps, with toxic wastewater slowly building up over time, indefinitely.

Pollution from metal mines has polluted aquifers, created long-standing public health risks and destroyed fish, wildlife and their habitats. The EPA estimates that abandoned and inactive mines have polluted 40 percent of the sources of Western rivers. The culprit behind the toxic orange color of Colorado’s Animas River is acid mine drainage, just one form of mine pollution. Acid mine drainage is so persistent, it can continue for hundreds to thousands of years — essentially forever. It can dissolve other harmful substances such as arsenic from the surrounding rock, wreaking havoc on plant and animal life.

What allows this kind of pollution to continue to threaten our scarce water resources? On a national level, the problem stems from the 1872 Mining Law. An antiquated law enacted before the light bulb was invented, it still governs metal mining on federal public lands and allows mining corporations to remove gold, silver and other valuable minerals from our public lands with no royalty payments and no environmental standards. It prioritizes mining over all other land uses."

Richard Lugar, a six-term Republican from Indiana who was very influential on foreign policy. It was Lugar’s office that torpedoed President Barack Obama’s 2010 attempt to restore ambassadorial relations with Venezuela. So Meacham, who is well connected with State Department officials and others in Washington who are involved in Latin America, is likely to have a good idea what the strategy is for people within and outside Barack Obama’s administration who do not want normal relations with Venezuela.

Of course, not everyone is happy with this about-face in relations. As I noted last month, efforts to sabotage the diplomatic effort were under way rather soon after it began. There will be more such efforts, and some of the reactions of the right to the Obama administration’s opening to Venezuela could provide a preview.

Remarkably, the statement contained no criticisms or remarks that might be seen as insulting to the Venezuelan government. I cannot remember seeing a comparable statement about Venezuela from the U.S. secretary of state for at least 14 years.

“I am pleased that we have found common cause in our support for Haiti’s elections, reconstruction, and development, as well as in our shared commitment to the Colombian government’s ongoing efforts to achieve a lasting peace,” Kerry said. “I look forward to further cooperation between our people and governments as we seek ways to improve a historically strong relationship that has endured for nearly two centuries.”

On the afternoon of July 2, just as everyone (including much of the media) was skipping town for the three-day holiday weekend, Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement sending his “best wishes to the people of Venezuela as you celebrate 204 years of independence on July 5.”

With the US scheduled to open an embassy in Cuba for the first time in half a century, more Americans might begin to wonder why we can’t have normal relations with Venezuela as well.

Meacham wrote last month that one of the objectives of the Obama administration’s current overtures is “ensuring the presence of Organization of American States (OAS) and European Union observers in Venezuela’s upcoming parliamentary elections.” But the Obama administration hasn’t said anything about such observers. It is possible that Meacham is saying this because the demand for OAS and EU observers will be part of the right-wing strategy to de-legitimize the upcoming National Assembly elections in December.

The strategy makes sense if the right can convince the media that the demand for OAS and EU observers is a reasonable one, that these observers are likely to provide an independent assessment of the integrity of the election process. However, the OAS has a very mixed track record. In 2000, for example, the OAS reversed its original approval of Haitian parliamentary elections after Washington decided it didn’t like the results. In 2011, also in Haiti, an OAS commission stacked with pro-Washington members took the astounding and unprecedented step of actually reversing the result — not recommending a new election or a recount, as is sometimes done with disputed elections — of a first-round presidential election. These and other interventions by the OAS raise questions about whether an impartial delegation from the OAS could be established, given Washington’s strong influence over the OAS bureaucracy.

Recall that in Venezuela’s presidential election of April 2013, the United States was the last government in the world to recognize the result — and only under pressure from the rest of the region, including Brazil. But there was no doubt about the result. In Venezuela, voters press computer touch-screens and receive printed receipts, which they then deposit in ballot boxes. For a random sample amounting to about half of the total ballots, the paper votes are compared with the electronic tally in the presence of observers and witnesses. In the 2013 election, a statistical analysis showed that the probability of getting the official vote count if the election were actually stolen was less than one in 25,000 trillion.

Yet the White House in 2013 wanted a “recount” before Washington would recognize the result. Given that there were violent opposition street protests at the time seeking to overturn the election results, this was not only dishonest but — until Obama finally gave in — quite a hostile and reckless position to take. This is just one of many episodes, going back to the U.S.-backed military coup of 2002, that help explain why it is difficult for many Venezuelans to trust the U.S. government.

So it won’t be surprising if there are attempts to destroy the White House’s détente initiative that involve conflict over the upcoming elections. But as long as the White House’s new approach lasts, it’s a good thing. With the U.S. scheduled to open an embassy in Cuba on July 20 for the first time in half a century, more Americans and maybe even some of our politicians and journalists might begin to wonder why we can’t have normal relations with Venezuela as well."

This was, for historical reasons, the case for most of the postwar period. But it has clearly come to an end with the Greek crisis. The largest member is offering the least in concessions. This, by itself, weakens the union, because it stimulates an equally uncompromising stance from the others and sends the message that the EU is based solely on relations of power. But then, other members may wonder about the meaning of a union in which everything is decided as if the states were not bound to one another by deeper ties. It also engenders the fear of stronger members’ domination of weaker ones.

Loss of trust among EU member states. The longer the crisis lasts, the more the trust among EU members will fray. For any association of countries or regions to function at least tolerably, a certain amount of trust, compromise and, in the economic sphere, redistribution of wealth from richer to poorer members is necessary. If states follow only their interests, to the disregard of everybody else’s, a union is impossible. For a political union to function, the amount of compromise required increases with the importance of the member state.

It is difficult to write anything new about the endless negotiations between Greece and the troika, or as they are called now, the institutions. The daily vicissitudes of the negotiations leave everyone who tries to follow them and draw conclusions wrongfooted — so quickly does one piece of news get contradicted by the next. Moreover, the institutions negotiating with Greece about its debt (the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the European Central Bank) are becoming a real troika in the sense that each of the actors seems to be playing its own game. And behind them, there are other actors (the German Ministry of Finance, the right wing of Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union party, the left wing of Greece’s ruling Syriza party) that, while not formal parties to the negotiations, are at times more important than those who sit around the table.

This disintegrating process is always accompanied by stereotyping, a popular response to the high politics that take place around the negotiating table. The process of stereotyping in the EU is fairly advanced, with pictures of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a Nazi posture, accusations of tactless and arrogant behavior by the northern countries, counteraccusations of laziness and mooching by the Greeks and other southern members further poisoning the atmosphere. The fear and loathing then descends to the popular level. It is naive to believe that, even if the negotiations are successful and, even more miraculously, the crisis were solved today, the stereotypes will be forgotten. Once they start being used in political discourse, moving from the netherworld of the Internet to discussion in ostensibly respectable quarters, the genie cannot be easily pushed back into the bottle. Every action by every actor will be judged and interpreted in that new light.

Impossibility of leftist polices under global capitalism. The second lesson is the continuation of what François Mitterrand’s France learned in the early 1980s: One cannot pursue an even moderate left-wing policy in a system of global capitalism. Syriza never got a chance to apply any of the leftist policies that it says it favors, because it was busy negotiating with the creditors and because it had no genuine freedom of economic decision-making, since basically all its policies were dictated by the troika. Even if it had a margin for maneuver, it is hard to see how its moderately leftist policies (halt to privatization, higher taxation, greater role for the public sector) could be implemented. Notice that we are talking here not of some radical anti-capitalist program but of just broadly leftist policies that try to limit somewhat the unimpeded invasion of the market and private interest into all social spheres. Such policies are obviously unacceptable not only to the mainstream EU but also to many individual governments, which fear Syriza-like movements in their countries.

It is reasonable to believe that some of the troika’s more inflexible demands had the objective of — in addition to bending the will of the Greek government — clearly demonstrating the inability of any left-wing government to exist and prosper within the current system and ultimately making the Greek people either pay dearly for having elected Syriza or oust the government. When Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras spoke of “humiliation,” he was saying the troika wanted to teach Syriza the lesson that it cannot rule from the left and stay in the eurozone. Or, to put it in graphic terms, bring Syriza to the pan-European table but wearing a jacket and tie.

The ghosts of Europe’s past are winning. What does the European Union stand for? Until 10 or 15 years ago, one could see the EU as a shining example of economic and political integration among erstwhile foes that brings to the members — and potentially to those around it — higher income (through convergence of poorer and richer members’ income levels), social protection and peace. But now, with the EU in disarray, it can hardly project that optimistic image to the rest of the world.

Moreover, through its incompetence and hubris, it is responsible for major external mistakes that have brought war and chaos to its southern and eastern edges, in Libya and Ukraine. Internally, the EU is becoming disunited and hence weaker; externally, it has turned into an exporter of instability.

Unless things radically change — and it is hard at this point to see how they can — it may lead a grandiose European project to a sad ending, in which the ghosts of the European past triumph over the best intentions."

It reiterated that the deadly attack, which killed at least 30 people and injured dozens more, violated the agreement among all parties to the conflict that the hospital was protected under international humanitarian law. It also contradicted Afghan claims that there was fighting in the area at the time of the strike.

President Barack Obama apologized for the botched attack, calling it a mistake, but the U.S. military has yet to provide an adequate explanation for the incident. “All the information that we've provided so far shows that a mistake is quite hard to understand and believe at this stage,” MSF’s general director, Christopher Stokes, said last week. “The view from inside the hospital is that this attack was conducted with a purpose to kill and destroy. But we don’t know why.”

The Department of Defense has promised an independent investigation into the attack, but Washington’s ability to undertake that job impartially is dubious, especially given the damning evidence of a war crime. A credible, transparent and independent investigation is necessary to ensure continued critical protections for humanitarian medical care.

MSF, which diligently protects its neutrality, has maintained that the facility treated civilians, government troops and Taliban forces without discrimination. It confirmed implementing and enforcing a no-weapons policy and said that there were no armed combatants in the hospital or fighting in the vicinity at the time of the attack.

The hospital’s location was no secret. The organization repeatedly sent the site’s GPS coordinates to all parties to the conflict, including the U.S. Defense Department, Afghan Ministry of Interior and the U.S. Army in Kabul, each of which confirmed receiving them. The most recent transmissions were sent four days before the attack. MSF placed two of its flags on the roof of the hospital, one of only a few buildings in the area that had electricity at the time, rendering it easily identifiable. The Green Berets who ordered the strike reportedly knew the compound was a functioning hospital but believed it was overrun by the Taliban. A day before the attack, an unnamed U.S. government official asked MSF whether the facility was under the Taliban’s control."

One of the sources Bibas cites is Fordham University law professor John Pfaff, whose research he uses to contradict ostensibly liberal criminologists who blame targeted drug enforcement for elevated incarceration rates among minority communities. Pfaff has spent the better part of a decade attempting to quantify the link between drug policy and prison growth, in large part by measuring historical changes in the number of drug offenders in federal and state custody. His findings suggest that despite high levels of drug arrests over the past 30 years, zero-tolerance drug enforcement has had a negligible impact at best on overall prison growth.

That a scholar of Bibas’ caliber would so easily dismiss a link between government policies and societal outcomes to score political points is bad enough. Worse, though, is his tendency to substantiate his narrow viewpoint using cherry-picked data from far more nuanced thinkers. In the process, he hijacks the vehicle of social science to present a dangerously simplistic picture of the problem of mass incarceration.

To make these points stick, he sets out to deconstruct the prevailing view that criminal behavior is sometimes a consequence of systemic forces such as racial and economic marginalization. The target of his polemic is the widely held belief that skyrocketing rates of incarceration in the U.S. since 1980 are largely a consequence of the war on drugs — which Bibas says is actually a manipulative lie orchestrated by a monolithic left with the help of a few libertarians.

Consider the recent article for the National Review Online by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Stephanos Bibas, a former federal prosecutor. He has written more than a dozen articles in prominent legal reviews and in 2012 released a sweeping historical appraisal of the American justice system. Yet he chooses to sully an otherwise insightful evidence-based exploration of America’s broken correctional system with low-rent partisan conjecture and simplistic moral pronouncements on the roots of criminal behavior (a lack of self-discipline), addiction (bad choices) and prison violence (inmates aren’t praying enough).

Yet this viewpoint risks minimizing the true impact of the war on drugs on prison growth and polluting the dialogue on prison reform with noxious politics masquerading as science.

Over the past few years, a small but prominent group of academics has been arguing that the links between drug policies and mass incarceration in the U.S. are overstated. This perspective is a valuable counterpoint to a reform dialogue that has been too narrowly focused on the need to release nonviolent drug offenders — exemplified most recently by a severely limited package of legislation unveiled on Oct. 1 in the Senate that walks back mandatory minimum sentences for some drug crimes while intensifying enforcement of other felonies.

Pfaff, whose primary interest is in identifying the steps most likely to address America’s prison crisis, rightly concludes that the early release of inmates who have committed violent offenses but are no longer a threat to public safety should be part of how the U.S. reduces mass incarceration. But in minimizing the broader ramifications of aggressive drug enforcement, he and other criminologists who echo his findings risk missing the forest for the trees.

To understand why, it’s important to consider the inherent limitations of quantitative measures in decoding complex social networks. Longitudinal data analysis is sort of like reviewing a series of time-lapse photographs: It’s useful for making conclusions about subjects that fall within the camera’s gaze, but it is as good as blind to any number of variables outside the frame.

Empiricists who study social deviance and criminal subcultures thus run into a problem. The world they seek to measure operates off the grid and rarely leaves a paper trail. The illegal drug economy is particularly elusive. Participants include people engaged in illicit activity as well as those tasked with preventing it. The crimes associated with this world include not only those that are functionally drug related but also a number of ancillary activities, ranging from money laundering and larceny to illegal gun sales, extortion, assault and murder.

The vast majority of people who traverse this network, including more than a few law enforcement officers, will come in contact with the criminal justice system — but many fall beyond the picture frame of predominant measures of the drug war’s reach. This makes assessing the full extent of the drug war’s impact on incarceration rates all but impossible using standard data metrics.

Focusing on inmates serving state or federal time for formal drug crimes, as Pfaff does, also excludes the roughly 3 million drug offenders who pass annually in and out of America’s municipal jails — many, if not most, of whom will be released without ever serving a day of state time. Research shows that the drug war has placed a crippling burden on these jails. A 2010 Pew report on Philadelphia’s jails cites increased arrests for drug possession as a primary reason for severe overcrowding, along with parole violations and an overburdened court system. But even that would identify only the direct casualties of the war on drugs. The collateral damage is much harder to measure. We may never know, for instance, how many poor youths drop out of school to sell drugs, parlaying that early introduction to the criminal subculture into convictions for other, nondrug felonies.

Once you factor in the multigenerational, marginal consequences of austere drug policy — including the effects of collateral sanctions for drug convictions, the diversion of resources from drug treatment to law enforcement, the trickle-down effects of imprisonment on families and communities, the racist police profiling that comes hand in hand with anti-narcotics efforts and the violence that accompanies black market economies — it’s hard to overstate the connection between prohibitionist drug policies and mass incarceration.

Criminologists are well aware of the many known unknowns that complicate their findings. And Pfaff is careful to make note of each of them in the many footnotes accompanying his texts. Perhaps his most critical missing link, however, involves the larger forces that inform his conclusions on police and prosecutorial aggressiveness — which he concedes are “almost impossible ... to empirically assess.”

It’s all but certain that police priorities are been strongly influenced by fear-laced political messaging on the subject of illicit drug use and its acute impact on public opinion. It is overly simplistic to blame the full scope of our prison crisis on one failed policy regime — but with so many gray areas still out of camera range, minimizing the impact of a trillion-dollar, 40-year expansion of the police state on our culture of mass incarceration risks obscuring one of the most obvious paths for reversing it. Exploiting that position to sow discord in a movement that has inspired unprecedented bipartisan support contributes nothing at all of value to the larger dialogue of prison reform."

He escaped from prison six months before, dealing a big blow to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. After the escape, the president’s popularity took a huge hit at home, and other countries started questioning the capacity of Mexican institutions to enforce the rule of law.

Peña Nieto triumphantly celebrated El Chapo’s recapture on Twitter. However, it is far from clear that Guzmán’s capture will have a significant positive effect on the severely battered president.

El Chapo had been an elusive figure for the Mexican authorities. He first escaped from prison in 2001, concealed in a laundry cart. He then remained a fugitive for 13 years. In the meantime, he consolidated his drug empire, the Sinaloa cartel in western Mexico. He has always drawn the fascination of Mexicans, many of whom see him as a Robin Hood–like figure. In Sinaloa, he was known for his largesse toward the local population.

Conservative Presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón of the National Action Party, who ran the country from 2000 to 2012, reportedly hunted Guzmán. However, neither one was able to capture him. Conspiracy theories emerged pointing to a possible underground arrangement between the right-wing governments and El Chapo.

In 2012, Peña Nieto took office, restoring to power the left-leaning Institutional Revolutionary Party, which had run Mexico for nearly a century. In 2014, less than a year and a half into his presidency, he captured Guzmán. At the time, the government was enjoying a bonanza of international praise for its bold reform agenda, including an overhaul of the telecommunications sector and a major blow to the country’s most powerful union. Time magazine even ran a cover with a heroically framed Peña Nieto, reading “Saving Mexico.”

But the honeymoon didn’t last long. Later that year, 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teacher’s College went missing in southern Mexico. A few months later, a group of journalists uncovered a conflict-of-interest scandal involving the president’s wife, after which they lost their jobs. Then the oil-dependent economy started to suffer from lower energy prices. Finally, in July, El Chapo made the news again: He escaped from prison through an ingenious system of tunnels, like something out of Hollywood.

After the escape, international media started looking more critically at Peña Nieto, wondering how things had gone so wrong so fast. The consensus has been that Mexico’s core weakness lies in its institutions and its feeble rule of law.

Government officials have used Guzmán’s recapture to argue that the country’s institutions are strong and working. Mexico’s economy minister recently declared, “The capture of El Chapo generates optimism in the world toward Mexico, and this encourages foreign investment by signaling that in the country, the rule of law prevails.”"
None,http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/2/apple-privacys-unfortunate-champion.html,Apple Has Become Privacy’s Unfortunate Champion,[u'Joshua Kopstein'],"[u'champion', u'encryption', u'governments', u'public', u'companys', u'unfortunate', u'digital', u'need', u'security', u'privacys', u'data', u'order', u'apple']","Still, the government’s criticism touches on a legitimate point, which is the undemocratic and ultimately dangerous prospect of outsourcing defense of our data and rights to giant corporations. As disturbing as the government’s request is, it can be similarly uncomfortable to see Apple painted as some kind of savior protecting us from an all-powerful Big Brother.

The government’s claim ignores both the consequences of Apple’s compliance and why companies started locking down their products in the first place. If the aftermath of National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden’s revelations proved anything, it’s that allowing encryption technology to control access to data is now the only effective way Americans can protect their information when the law fails or refuses to do so. Apple may be posturing to maintain its reputation, but that reputation is built on providing something that consumers desperately need and want — and that governments fail to provide.

The U.S. Department of Justice has grown frustrated with this security model, claiming that Apple’s design places the company’s need to maintain its public image above its need to comply with the law. In a court filing responding to the company’s public defiance of the order, the government accused Apple of “marketing its products to allow technology, rather than the law, to control access to data.”

It’s strange and slightly unnerving to see people rally in support of a multibillion-dollar corporation, but Apple has earned this praise for good reason. Over the last few years, the computing conglomerate and its CEO Tim Cook have quietly become a bulwark of digital security and privacy, most notably through improvements in the encryption of mobile devices that prevent any third party, including the company, from accessing users’ data. This is the result of smart design: In order to protect customers’ private messages and data, Apple chose to engineer out every point of failure, including itself.

The rally, one of dozens organized in cities across the country by the activist group Fight For the Future, was in support of Apple, which recently challenged an unprecedented court order demanding the company help the U.S. government hack an iPhone used by one of the attackers involved in last December’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead. In doing so, it plunged into a legal fray that few companies have the conviction — let alone the resources — to fight.

On Tuesday night, news crews surrounded the Apple store on Fifth Avenue near Central Park in Manhattan. But for once, the press wasn’t there to cover the launch of the latest iPhone. About two dozen people had gathered behind metal barricades across from the tech company’s glowing glass cube storefront, braving bone-chilling winds and freezing rain to chant slogans and display signs on the screens of their smartphones that said “Don’t break our phones” and “Secure phones save lives.”

Lest we forget, the company’s electronics empire was built on the backs of mistreated Chinese factory workers, Congolese coltan miners exploited by violent militias, and countless people in Asia and Africa suffering from toxic e-waste generated by the company's unsustainably designed products. Apple also routinely polices the content of software available on its walled garden App Store, issuing opaque and arbitrary rulings that impose strict limits on the range of acceptable political speech. (In the past, forbidden topics have included U.S. military drone strikes, suicide and unsurprisingly, the ethical issues of manufacturing smartphones.)

It's not the first time activists have rallied around large corporations to defend their rights. In 2014, a successful campaign for net neutrality, which challenged greedy Internet service providers’ plans to divide the Internet into fast and slow lanes, was significantly emboldened by the advocacy of large tech firms such as Netflix, Facebook and Google. Before that it was the Stop Online Piracy Act, the maligned Internet censorship bill disguised as an anti-piracy measure; that effort was also defeated, thanks in large part to Silicon Valley companies aligning with grass-roots activists. At this point, it’s assured that whenever digital rights are threatened, the ensuing protests must be uncomfortably couched by the endorsements of sympathetic tech firms, who lend their lobbying power to make these causes “legitimate” in the eyes of our representatives and the media.

In the San Bernardino mass shooting case, the stakes are especially high. The government’s demands would impact not only Apple and its customers, but the entire architecture of trust which underpins the technology industry. That’s because for Apple to comply with the order, it needs to build a modified version of its iOS operating system that disables several security measures, including one that wipes the device’s memory when the passcode is entered incorrectly 10 times. With that restriction removed, investigators would be free to “brute force” the code by trying every possible combination.

In order for the malicious version of iOS to properly load onto the device, Apple will also need to cryptographically sign it with a special key, just as it does for legitimate software updates. If the U.S. government shows it can legally force a company to use its trusted credentials to create malware, users will no longer have any reason to trust the updates that are routinely delivered to their devices. There will no longer be any legal or technical barriers preventing the government from unlocking any iPhone. And once the U.S. has this ability, China, Russia and other unscrupulous governments around the world will finally be on terra firma to demand the same.

In other words, what Apple’s critics misleadingly frame as privacy versus public safety is actually a battle between security and pervasive vulnerability.

Americans look to companies such as Apple for security because they simply have no alternatives. There is no political party in the U.S. that supports funding strong encryption or promises to reign in overzealous government surveillance. The sad reality is that if the average person wants digital security, their only option is to vote with their money. This is made worse by the fact that Apple’s secure iOS devices are prohibitively expensive compared to their much cheaper and much less secure competitor, Android. The result is what American Civil Liberties Union technologist Chris Soghoian calls the “digital security divide” in which poorer members of society are priced out of technologies to keep their data secure.

It’s crucial that Apple wins its case and prevents a dangerous legal precedent for being set. But ultimately, we will need to find ways to replace corporate allies with robust privacy laws, public investment in encryption, and government accountability."

Advocates in the food justice movement have been working for decades to get people to do just that, and they have now found an influential ally in New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman. Few writers have done more to popularize the food justice movement than Bittman, who wrote the best-selling tome “How To Cook Everything.” Through his weekly recipe column, “The Minimalist,” Bittman introduced millions of people to the idea that they don’t have to forsake their health for culinary pleasure. Since his move to the paper’s opinion pages, Bittman has become increasingly outspoken about the political issues that make it difficult for everyone, regardless of their economic background, to eat healthy food — and he has done a remarkable job of making connections between healthy eating and the larger movement for a more equitable society.



Food activist

Bittman’s increasingly political writing has not come out of the blue. An active participant in the protest movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Bittman always believed that the different causes he supported — feminism, anti-war, black power and the poor people’s movements — were all pointing to a larger critique of market-driven society. “There’s a reason we all are involved in these different struggles, but the reason is a common reason,” says Bittman. “I worked in community organizing for a number of years. The job was to try to unify people who thought the environment was the most important thing with people who were anti-war, with women’s liberation people, with people who thought alternative health was the most important thing.” In 1969, when he was still a student activist, Bittman began cooking for himself out of necessity: The New York City native found the culinary options in his college town of Worcester, Massachusetts, to be distressingly limited. Although he took to cooking with gusto, he did not consider his new pastime’s place in the larger drama he saw unfolding around him. “I cooked, but I didn’t think of food as a political subject,” he now recalls. In his mid-twenties, Bittman worked as an organizer with the now-defunct Somerville Tenants Union. Then, after moving to New Haven with his wife and their newborn daughter, he quit politics to concentrate on cooking, cleaning and other chores to support his family. The skills he cultivated in the process assisted greatly in his transformation from restaurant critic of the alternative weekly The New Haven Advocate to renowned bestselling author.

Bittman has used his platform to call attention to the exploitation of farm laborers, the need for a universal basic income and the connections between healthy eating and higher wages.

After the success of his 1992 cookbook “Fish,” the New York Times came calling. “The Minimalist” debuted in 1997. From the beginning of Bittman’s writing career in 1980 through the opening years of the new century, his political sensibilities did not make a significant appearance in his work. It was only as leading food justice journalists such as Eric Schlosser and Michael Pollan began exploring the institutional and systemic causes of America’s dietary habits that Bittman realized he had more to say about food than recipes.

Cicero expressed it that way in his phrase “Inter arma enim silent leges” (In wartime, laws are silent). The assumption in this line of thinking is that when a society is threatened existentially, it’s incumbent on the state to do everything in its power to neutralize the threat, including sacrificing the normal legal processes of peacetime for wartime expediency. Jurist and philosopher Carl Schmitt defined the power of the sovereign, the supreme source of political will in any country, as emanating from its ability to define “the exception.”

Time is central to how we define war. Temporally, wartime stands apart from the normality of peace. The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben went so far as to define war in direct opposition to normality, calling it a “suspension of the legal order itself,” dramatizing a major social effect of wartime: a parallel set of laws or no laws at all during martial struggle.

Without even the pretense of legal cover for the conduct of war, are we now entering an age when the demarcation between wartime and peacetime is meaningless? What do we lose when that distinction is eroded?

AUMFs have a precedent going back to 1798 and don’t always result in the use of force, but the AUMF that Congress gave the president on Sept. 14, 2001, was basically an open-ended abdication of congressional responsibility to rein in executive wartime privilege. Since then, the AUMF has been used as dubious legal cover for conducting attacks all around the world, including in countries with which we’re not at war and against American citizens .

The legal question of Congress’ ability to put a check on the executive’s use of military force raises a serious question, When is America actually at war? The fact that Obama has been able to deploy troops and conduct airstrikes without a formal declaration speaks to the practical meaninglessness of an authorization for use of military force (or AUMF).

His statement’s brazenness was almost camouflaged by its simplicity. The president was saying that he didn’t need Congress to declare war in order for him to conduct war. Or, to be more accurate, he didn’t need Congress to continue conducting war.

During his final State of the Union address, President Barack Obama challenged members of Congress to “send a message to our troops and the world” by finally authorizing the use of military force against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), then said that they weren’t really necessary when it came to doing so. “The American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as the terrorists before them,” he said.

In the late 19th century, wars ballooned to sizes and costs completely unprecedented in human history as war and industrialism became entwined in a double helix. Mass production and modern transportation became the backbone of any large-scale military endeavor. Since the Civil War, every major conflict has preceded a tightening of the belt, as Maj. Jason Warren, a faculty member at the U.S. Army War College, put it. And that means switching from a wartime economy back to a peacetime one. Factories turned from making things essential to the war back to meeting peacetime demands; materials such as rubber, aluminum and silk were no longer rationed by the armed forces. And so in this demarcation of normality, wartime meant that the economy was also on a wartime footing, that average citizens were expected to make material sacrifices in their day-to-day lives and that every last industrial resource was martialed for the war effort. This economic shift from a war back to a peacetime economy was another example of normality versus the aberration of wartime.

In a 1940 speech Franklin Delano Roosevelt warned that if the Axis powers won World War II, “we would have to convert ourselves purely into a militaristic power on the basis of war economy.” Despite the Allied victory, the atomic bomb ensured that his prophecy came true. The anxiety of the Cold War, with two nuclear-armed superpowers poised at each other’s throats, was a major step toward achieving a permanent state of war without war: the growth of a permanent war economy and the nation on a permanent war footing without the declaration of war against the Soviet Union.

The state of affairs that emerged gave rise to the now permanent military-industrial complex that Dwight D. Eisenhower warned about in his farewell address as president on Jan. 17, 1961. Wars against North Korea and Vietnam, falling under the umbrella of the Cold War, were representative of the constant struggle against communism. War against an ideology instead of a state only seemed to confirm the confused definition of normality in the second half of the 20th century.

The global “war on terrorism” was another step in the same direction. Before the 9/11 attacks, terrorism and war were two different and very distinct things. But drawing on a Cold War precedent, George W. Bush and his administration decided to split the difference. By calling America’s struggle against terrorism a war, he was indicating that the U.S. was entering a time when the normal rules didn’t apply.

The 9/11 AUMF, which took the place of a formal declaration of war, is at the center of this ambiguity. It reads:

That the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.

As Gregory Johnsen wrote for Buzzfeed, its power hinges almost entirely on this single sentence.

That sentence doesn’t have to be misread or overinterpreted to mean that the White House has the authority to kill whomever it wants, wherever it wants, without a formal declaration of war. Judging by this sentence alone, Obama doesn’t seem wrong in insisting that this AUMF gives him the legal cover to bomb Syria. It clearly does. It also authorizes pre-emptive strikes.

Rather than see this AUMF as a singular obstacle in the path to a restoration of conventional wartime and peacetime, it should be read as an artifact that confirms a long-running trend. The U.S. has been on something resembling a wartime footing at least since the beginning of the Cold War. Even during drawdowns, our military still eats up a huge portion of our budget. Our special forces and clandestine services have been consistently subverting international law since the end of World War II. And the global “war on terrorism” has only kicked the trend into overdrive, so that on a now permanent wartime footing, the traditional legal and economic markers of normality are disappearing.

What would normality look like? Would we be spending $11 million a day on airstrikes? Would the government be spying on its citizens? Would American troops still be dying in Afghanistan? Until the future president, whoever that turns out to be, gets something more than acquiescence in response to the blurring of discrete wartime and peacetime, this will be the new normal for the U.S. — a never-ending series of international escapades, paired with extralegal intelligence gambits, financed at exorbitant costs by American taxpayers. George Orwell put it best: “a peace that is no peace.”"

Tel Aviv was established as a garden suburb of the type popular in England at the turn of the 20th century, one removed from yet accessible to Jaffa, which was the cultural and economic capital of pre-1948 Palestine. But over the coming decades, it turned into the gleaming “White City” we recognize today as a world center of modernist International Style, or Bauhaus. As with so many foundational myths, Tel Aviv’s relies on the physical erasure of the past — in this case, the communities that had inhabited the region for generations before. Its founders never tried to hide it. “It was from the overthrow of geography that Tel Aviv was born,” the official town gazette declared in 1933. Writer Shai Agnon, artist Nahum Gutman and many of their contemporaries would depict Tel Aviv as a “city on the sands,” an outpost of modern civilization in a physical and cultural desert. There are analogous gentrification scenarios playing out all over the world, from Mumbai to New Orleans. But Paris in particular stands out as a city whose origin story hides ugly, and forgotten, histories. And so it is as historically fitting as it is ethically and politically troubling that Paris hosted a “plage Tel Aviv” along the River Seine as part of its yearly summer “Paris plage” festival. Since 2002 the festival, which draws millions of visitors every year to its “sands,” water misters, music and beach ambience. The Paris municipality decided to name one of the days “Tel Aviv on the Seine” in honor of the Israeli city’s famed reputation as a liberal beach city par excellence. For Paris’ political elite, Tel Aviv represented the “good” Israel — culturally and politically free and progressive, and in fact a symbol of the possibility of peace — even if they were critical of the brutal policies of the Benjamin Netanyahu government. Sadly, the history and present-day realities of Tel Aviv, especially its relationship with its “mother city” turned marginalized neighborhood of Jaffa, reflect conquest and conflict far more than peace and harmony. From the moment of its creation until today, Zionist and Israeli leaders have been in constant conflict with the local Palestinian Arab population as the Jewish city’s growth encroached on the territory of the Arab city and its surrounding villages. If Tel Aviv has always defined itself as the quintessentially modern and European city, for Arabs its birth and development epitomized the negative impact of Zionism on their homeland. Parisians with a sense of history can — and should — sympathize with the inhabitants of Jaffa who were swept away to make room for the beloved and mythical city that is presently hosting a small sliver of Tel Aviv. In 1853, Napoleon III appointed Baron Georges Eugene Haussmann to “modernize” Paris, and the resulting transformation of the city’s urban core was anything but peaceful.

If Jaffa went to hell, I would not count myself among the mourners. David Ben Gurion

Around the time of the 1848 revolutions, Paris was a hotbed of social and political turmoil and economic unrest, and shared many similarities with early 20th century Jaffa. Wealthier Parisians stood to profit from the “modernization” of the city along more commerce and bourgeois-friendly lines, while poor and working class residents stood to lose the security their admittedly dirty, cramped neighborhoods provided against outsiders and the state. These neighborhoods also housed dense networks of solidarity and economic activity that was not yet exploited — nor valued — by the emerging bourgeoisie and its state institutions. It was the very impenetrability of these areas that enabled resistance movements whenever the political and economic situation became too oppressive. And that, in turn, was what led Napoleon to ask Haussmann to “revolution proof” the reconstructed areas. The development and expansion of Jaffa and its environs was both more organic and less painful than that of Paris 50 years before. But Jaffa’s “Old Town” received its own Haussmannization in 1936, when in response to the growing Palestinian revolt against British rule and Zionist expansion, the British military blew up large swaths of the Old City and built broad avenues to make it easier to move troops and avoid snipers. Local officials publicly defended the destruction as a “renewal” and “improvement” scheme that would modernize the area and open it up to better air and traffic flow. But the conflation of town planning and population control was impossible to ignore. Indeed, David Ben Gurion, then the political leader of Palestine’s Jewish community, declared, “I would welcome the destruction of Jaffa ... Let it come ... If Jaffa went to hell, I would not count myself among the mourners.”

People covered in mock blood near a Palestinian flag and a placard which reads, ""Gaza - My Love on Seine"" stage their death on a artificial sand beach at ""Paris Plages"" to protest the ""Tel Aviv on Seine"" event, in Paris, France, August 13, 2015. Pascal Rossignol / Reuters The beach was central to the coexistence between Jews and Palestinians in Tel Aviv and Jaffa during the early Zionist era — and indeed, long after. In 1915 the local military governor of Jaffa, Hassan Bey, built a mosque by the sea specifically to block the southward expansion of Zionist Tel Aviv. The mixed working class neighborhood of Manshiyyeh quickly became a site of constant conflict. Indeed, the first Palestinian revolt erupted there in 1921 when a group of Bolshevik Jews marching and chanting pro-worker slogans through its streets were mistaken by Palestinians as attackers on the warpath. Tel Aviv’s beach was also a favorite destination for Jaffa’s Palestinian Arab population, who frequented Tel Aviv’s cinemas and markets near the border of Jaffa. Feeling threatened by this intermingling, Jewish leaders sent regular letters to the British to complain about the “invasion” of Arabs, and one senior Jewish official even threatened to “blow up with bombs” a local market that served both populations. After its incorporation into Tel Aviv in 1949, Jaffa was flooded with Jewish immigrants (often darker-skinned) from the Muslim world. The Jewish population of the new combined “Tel Aviv-Yafo” municipality would dominate the few thousand Palestinians who remained in the neighborhoods bordering the sea. The once vibrant town again became known as a dirty and crime-ridden place in the Israeli imagination. And the beach fell into disrepair until the beginnings of gentrification in the 1980s, which naturally included attempts to remove the remaining Palestinian Arab fishermen from the port as part of its renewal. While this brought about significant gentrification, Jaffa’s Palestinian population has remained economically and politically marginalized. Even as Jaffa’s beaches have slowly been developed, the incessant government and market pressures on the population to leave has transformed the act of merely remaining in Jaffa to be as much an act of “ summud ” — or steadfastness, a defining word of Palestinian resistance — as that of their compatriots across the Green Line or the Israeli bedouins whose lands continue to be confiscated despite generations of loyal service to the Israeli state.

Given the two cities’ histories, the cheap propaganda epitomized by Plage Tel Aviv no longer holds water in most politically conscious cities on Earth."

Wearing an open-neck shirt, a style favored by Europe’s new radical left, he addressed the crowd with a stark anti-austerity message. “We don’t have to be unequal,” he said. “It does not have to be unfair. Poverty isn’t inevitable. Things can — and they will — change.” This summer has seen an extraordinary transformation of the British Labour Party. This wave culminated in the party election of Corbyn, a veteran from its hard-left faction, as its new leader. Few outside Labour circles had even heard of the man even a few months ago. While other European countries such as Spain and Greece have seen the rise of radical socialist alternatives to established parties of the center-left, in Britain the anti-austerity socialist surge has transformed Labour from the inside rather than displaced it. Nobody saw this coming, Corbyn included. How did this happen? And what will be the consequences of Labour’s unexpected change of direction?

A crushing victory

Corbyn delivered a crushing victory in the party’s internal election, a victory greater than even his most ardent supporters imagined possible. In a field of four candidates, Corbyn won 59.5 percent in the first round of voting —garnering three times as many votes as the second- and third-place candidates, the experienced former ministers Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper. Liz Kendall, the candidate whose business-friendly agenda was closest to the views of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, languished in a distant fourth place, with a mere 4.5 percent of the vote. Corbyn’s share and margin of victory dwarfed Blair’s results when he was elected leader in 1994. Just as strikingly, Labour’s membership has increased by almost half, from 200,000 to 300,000 since the May 7 electoral defeat, as new members joined in order to vote for Corbyn. A further 105,000 new registered supporters also voted in the election, with Corbyn scoring an extraordinary 84 percent share among this group. He now has a powerful mandate to change the party’s direction, away from the centrist, pro-market policies of the New Labour era and toward an anti-austerity, egalitarian politics of the radical left. In explaining his strange victory, one has to start with what immediately preceded it. When voting closed at 10 p.m. on the day of the British general election, Labour Party staffers were expecting that Ed Miliband would become prime minister. As immediately became clear, Labour’s performance was much weaker than hoped, and Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron prevailed, with a small absolute majority of parliamentary seats. His junior coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, were virtually annihilated (falling from 56 seats to eight). Labour failed to make up sufficient ground against the Tories and found itself crushed in Scotland, where a dominant Scottish National Party increased its seats from six to 56 (out of 59 for Scotland).

None of the centrist candidates learned the most basic lesson of American politics: Candidate should tack to their base to win the nomination and then tack to the center for the national election.

Miliband held his party together skillfully, and Labour increased its vote share by 1.5 percentage points from its 2010 result under then–Prime Minister Gordon Brown. But the impression remained that the party was falling between two stools. Flashes of radical energy from Miliband were overshadowed by periods of extreme caution, with elements of the party’s platform mocked by David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s chief political strategist and a sometime adviser to Miliband, as amounting to offering the public no more than the chance to “Vote Labour and win a microwave.” Labour decided early on after its 2010 defeat not to challenge Conservative Chancellor George Osborne’s basic argument for postcrash austerity, opting instead to develop a version of austerity with a human face. Miliband on occasion signaled his egalitarian and reforming commitments by attacking predatory businesses and championing the rights of those in low-paid and precarious employment, but the public was left with an insufficiently clear sense of Labour’s overall economic message. At his most engaging, Miliband seemed to promise a decisive move away from Blair’s New Labour politics toward the pursuit of a more equitable and responsible model of capitalism. But Miliband’s election as leader was extremely narrow, and this restricted his ability to break decisively from the New Labour orthodoxy. As his chief speechwriter put it after the elections, “Miliband and his team never settled on a single way to describe the historic break we were aiming at.” Signals remained mixed, and party unity was achieved at the cost of muddying the waters between New Labour business as usual and a radically new vision. This middle strategy meant that Labour lost votes in two directions. It lost Scotland to the avowedly anti-austerity Scottish National Party and lost over a million votes to the left-wing Green Party. It also failed to convert many Conservative voters, to stem the tide to the anti-European U.K. Independence Party or to benefit sufficiently from the implosion of the Liberal Democrats. When the Labour leadership campaign began, the more mainstream candidates Burnham, Cooper and Kendall seemed to see only half the problem. It became the ever-present cliché of the campaign that Labour lost because it was anti-business and insufficiently interested in economic aspiration. Burnham launched his campaign at the London offices of the auditing and consulting firm Ernst & Young, presumably as an unsubtle way of communicating his pro-business credentials. For Labour members and activists who only weeks before were campaigning for a party that spoke about the need for a fairer and more equal economy, this shift was jarring, if not insulting. Burnham, Cooper and Kendall compounded this impression when they all abstained, along with a majority of their party colleagues, on the parliamentary vote on Osborne’s welfare reform bill. This proposal introduced severe cuts in welfare payments, including a removal of all child tax credits for the third child and subsequent ones in each family, thereby creating a welfare system that will predictably cause a significant rise in child poverty. Corbyn, needless to say, voted against the bill, making simple and accessible moral arguments about the political need to protect society’s most vulnerable members. It appears that none of the centrist candidates — not even Cooper, who worked for President Bill Clinton’s first presidential campaign, in 1992 — learned the most basic lesson of American politics: Candidate should tack to their base to win the nomination and then tack to the center for the national election. Other than Corbyn, the Labour candidates appeared to do the opposite, thereby alienating Labour’s membership as they tried to conform to a media-driven standard of respectable electability.

The boundaries of political debate are about to shift.

This dynamic created fertile ground for Corbyn, who embarked on an energetic campaign of public meetings, repeating his straightforward message of unbending opposition to the Tories and hope for a socialist alternative. At the same time, his campaign made skilful use of social media and produced a raft of thoughtful policy papers that ranged from big-picture issues — such as his proposals for a “people’s quantitative easing,” whereby the Bank of England would create money to be spent on infrastructure projects and lifelong national education service — to more-targeted proposals on regional development, mental health services and arts funding. Britain’s largest labor unions, Unite and Unison, backed his campaign, which found particular resonance with two groups: older former Labour supporters, including many who left the party over the Iraq War (which Corbyn vehemently opposed), and younger voters, for whom the formation of New Labour and the ideological battles of the 1980s and ’90s were just an abstraction from the history books and who could be enthused by hearing — often for the first time — the socialist case being made with passion and directness. The surprising lack of political dexterity shown by Corbyn’s competitors is more readily understandable in light of their background as political insiders, each of whom moved from jobs working for senior Labour politicians before becoming MPs and then junior ministers. Each developed a career in a party in which loyalty and caution were rewarded and patronage was crucial. While they were effective operators within the hierarchy of the party, they both seemed bewildered when the old certainties began to crumble. In a Britain where inequality has increased and lines of opportunity have silted up, someone like Corbyn, who seemed reassuringly normal and who could speak sincerely without employing the tortuous, overcautious doublespeak of the career politician, could flourish.

Regional leaders remain divided over how to resolve the simmering tensions. Washington hoped to persuade ASEAN nations during the two-day trade and economic summit at the Sunnylands resort in California to agree to a joint statement calling on Beijing to respect international law and commit to a peaceful resolution. But the statement released after the summit did not even mention China.

Beijing appears to be solidifying its presence in the disputed waters through a sustained buildup of infrastructure on key re-claimed features such as Mischief and Fiery Cross Reefs. China, which has the most expansive claim to the disputed area, has condemned the U.S. freedom of navigation operation last month, in which an American guided missile destroyer came within 12 miles of the Chinese administered Triton Island.

There is little sign that China will halt its expeditious land reclamation in the area. As Obama and his Asian counterparts wrapped up the Sunnylands summit on Tuesday, U.S. and Taiwanese officials said Beijing has placed surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island, which is claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Taiwan may not be recognized as a state party to this dispute, but it continues to play a critical role through both its claims and administration of Taiping, the largest island in the disputed waters. Taiwan’s lame duck President Ma Ying-jeou has been at the center of the burgeoning standoff in recent months. In November Ma held a landmark meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore. It was first official interaction between mainland China and Taiwan since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Ma followed up his provocations with a visit to the disputed Taiping islet last month.

Taiping — Itu Aba as referred to by the Philippines — is the largest of the naturally occurring islands in the Spratly Chain, which covers a vast area of small reefs and islands claimed by a range of other regional states including China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines.

Ma’s decision to visit Taiping drew widespread criticism and diplomatic rebukes especially from the Philippines and the United States. Washington expressed “disappointment,” saying the visit was “extremely unhelpful and does not contribute to the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea.” Manila emphasized “shared responsibility” and called on all parties “to refrain from actions that can increase tension in the South China Sea.”

Beijing’s condemnation was noticeably absent. China views Taiwan’s buildup of infrastructure on Taiping as serving its own purposes under the premise that the island will likely eventually end up in its hands in a Cross-Straits reunification scenario. This creates a strategic quandary for the U.S. and its allies in Asia."

Thirteen other states are considering bills, including New York, and a ballot initiative was approved by Arizona voters on Nov. 4. California’s Jerry Brown became the first and only governor to veto a right-to-try bill last month.

The success of these laws has hinged on an outpouring of support for terminal patients, often children, whose parents desperately want access to drugs not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Emotional campaigns have captured thousands of Facebook and Twitter followers, and pulled at the heartstrings of state legislators across the country. But the bills do nothing to guarantee drug access, let alone save lives. They do, however, pose a danger to new, potentially lifesaving pharmaceuticals in development.

The push to sidestep the FDA’s approval process began in earnest in 2008 when Abigail Alliance, a nonprofit founded by Frank Burroughs and named for his daughter, who died of cancer in 2001, partnered with the conservative Washington Legal Foundation to argue in court that patients had a constitutional right to receive unapproved drugs. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

Social media gave the cause momentum in March 2014, when Tennessee mother Aimee Hardy posted a plea on Facebook for her son, Josh, who was sick with an adenovirus that was attacking his immune system. Chimerix, a company developing a drug called brincidofovir to treat the virus denied the family’s initial request. #SaveJosh, for lack of a better term, went viral; Chimerix executives even receiveddeath threats. Less than a week later, Chimerix negotiated a new trial with the FDA, one that could enroll Hardy. But the tone of the #SaveJosh campaign, which reduced the complicated issues of drug testing and approval to a simple, impassioned plea for one boy’s life, stuck.

Colorado became the first state to approve right-to-try when Gov. John Hickenloopersigned a bill into law in May last year. During the campaign, state Sen. Irene Aguilar, a doctor and co-sponsor of the measure, nicknamed it the Dallas Buyer’s Club bill, after a 2013 movie that (not completely accurately) chronicles activist Ron Woodroof, who smuggled unapproved AIDS drugs into the U.S. in the 1980s.

When Republican Utah state Rep. Gage Froerer introduced a right-to-try bill in January, he said, “It gives hope. It gives the opportunity for patients and doctors to make decisions based upon what’s best for their patients.”

Politicians readily gain the favor of their constituents when they champion legislation that shows their compassion, particularly when the bill is intended to do something as uncontroversial as save lives.

However, hope may be all right-to-try laws provide. Based on model legislation drafted by the libertarian Goldwater Institute, the laws have several restrictions that make their passage all but meaningless for requesting patients. Drug companies are not required to comply with requests; insurance companies, which don’t cover experimental drug costs, aren’t either, leaving many terminal patients without the resources to pay. The bills are restricted to terminal patients who may be too sick for any drug, however effective, to reverse their diagnosis.

What’s more, experimental treatment could prevent terminal patients from enrolling in hospice care, an end-of-life service that Medicaid will cover only when patients stop curative treatment."

It’s no wonder that it’s so appealing to de-emphasize employment as an individual’s central source of meaning and identity.

News of the “six hour” workday feeds a growing desire to challenge assumptions about what a working life should look like, among, in particular, young people let down by an economy in which stable, long-term careers are harder to come by.

Today, Sweden, Denmark and Norway collectively serve as a canvas onto which liberals and conservatives in the U.S. project their hopes and fears, particularly around election time. Shareable memes featuring debatable statistics, and fawning puff pieces — usually illustrated by a sunny aerial view of Stockholm’s Old Town — reinforce the image of Scandinavia as a beacon of social welfare. Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders even touts Denmark as a working example of some of the policies he wants to implement in the U.S.

The trial is ongoing and its effects have yet to be fully evaluated, which means that even in Sweden, the study has generated a great deal more debate and opinion than it has, so far, any concrete facts or analysis. This should not surprise us: the story of Sweden’s six-hour workday fits in neatly with a broader narrative of Nordic progressivism.

The reality of Sweden’s six-hour workday is a little less revolutionary. Starting early 2015, the town of Gothenburg initiated a yearlong trial at a local nursing home: some 60 nurses switched from eight- to six-hour days, with the same salary as before. Researchers are looking at changes in productivity, overall health and happiness among the staff, number of sick days and staff retention, as well as satisfaction among the elderly residents. A handful of other places, including some small private companies, have followed suit.

With headlines such as “ Why Sweden’s New 6-Hour Work Day Standard Is a Good Idea ” and “ What the U.S. could learn from Sweden’s 6-hour work day ” lighting up our newsfeeds, it would be easy to believe that Sweden had made yet another giant stride towards attaining work-life balance paradise.

While international coverage has mainly focused on the increased productivity and health benefits of shorter working days, for the Swedish left, the reform is also seen as a means of realizing more ideological ambitions. A shorter working day could create more jobs, with new hires needed to pick up the hours lost to the reduction. It is seen as an act of solidarity, of sharing work in times of unemployment and slow growth, and as a means of achieving the aim of full employment: a kind of nationwide version of the practice among some companies of temporarily introducing furloughs and reduced hours in order to avoid layoffs. (While unemployment in Sweden has been falling since the recession, it is now around 7 percent, with higher percentages among the young, foreign-born, or those without college degrees.)

Reducing working hours is also seen — perhaps particularly among supporters in the Green Party — as a step towards towards a greener, less consumption-driven economy, where free time is prioritized over higher wages, a bigger house, another car. These ideas are a little more complex and might be harder to swallow, even for liberals, in radically pro-business America. Certainly more so than the happy image of a nurse who has decided to use her newfound free time to take up jogging.

Meanwhile, the trial at Svartedalen nursery home has just been extended another year. While the statistics aren’t yet in, interviews suggest that the nursing staff is happier, more alert and less stressed. The residents are also pleased, and the quality of care has increased. But the trial isn’t cheap: 14 new nurses have been hired to cover the extra shifts. This is also the primary concern among conservatives, who argue that a universal reduction working hours would be prohibitively expensive, cause stagnating wages with reduced growth and a diminishing tax base as the result.

That is why an across-the-board reduction of working hours won’t happen in Sweden for a good while yet. Although this most recent study may be the most comprehensive so far, it is by no means the first: Experiments with six-hour workdays were made in a number of municipalities throughout the 90’s. Calls for a six-hour workday have been heard since the early 1970’s. Isolated trials aside, however, none of the political parties that have reduced working hours as part of their platform — the Left, the Green Party, and Feminist Initiative — have made the issue a priority on the national level. Neither has LO, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. Ironically, the Social Democrats, a party that supports the working class, no longer has any mention of a six-hour workday in its party platform. Rather, they speak of the need for an increase in total working hours, primarily by raising the retirement age and by guaranteeing full-time employment for current part-time workers.

The political will to invest in a universal six-hour workday, in other words, simply does not exist in Sweden today.

The Swedish six-hour workday stories and tales like it — such as the one about Sweden running out of garbage that made the rounds on social media a couple of years ago — seem to fill a certain need, particularly in the U.S. The dream of the progressive little country in the North is rooted in the hope that another, better way of life is possible."

As in January, Syriza’s Alexis Tsipras will be able to form a parliamentary majority in coalition with the right-wing populist Independent Greeks party. On the other hand, Syriza is now committed to implementing a harsh, deeply unpopular austerity program that even its advocates among the European authorities acknowledge will keep the Greek economy in depression through the end of this year and next.

Does this mean that the battle for Greece’s future is over and that those who claimed that there was no alternative to prolonged depression, mass unemployment and a more unequal and, frankly, uglier society have won?

There is no question that the European authorities — the European Central Bank, the European Commission and Eurogroup of finance ministers (led by Germany) — and the International Monetary Fund have, for now, succeeded in imposing their will on Greece. On July 5, the vast majority of Greeks voted to reject their economic plan, including further austerity. But the European Central Bank did something that perhaps no central bank had ever done: It forced a shutdown of the Greek banking system. This caused economic havoc that pushed the economy back into recession and threated to prolong and deepen the depression that Greeks have suffered for six years. This act of financial terrorism worked: Syriza made a U-turn after the referendum, accepting the European officials’ plan, and told the Greek people that there was no choice.

It is not surprising that, aside from the record-low voter turnout, Syriza was able to win this appeal. In most countries, when the most important political leaders of the biggest parties and the vast majority of the media all agree that something is a fact, it becomes a “fact” even if it is not. Within the context of this “fact” that there was no choice but to submit to the will of the European authorities, it makes sense that most of Syriza’s voters would return it to power. Syriza is more likely than its biggest rival, the right-wing New Democracy, to use whatever breathing space there is to soften the impact of austerity on the poorest Greeks and to make the rich pay more of the taxes that they owe the public treasury."

Until body and tongue lie dead

Speak, for truth is living yet

Speak whatever must be said.

—Faiz Ahmed Faiz (translation by V.G. Kiernan)

Faiz, a poet who wrote in Pakistan under Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq’s martial law from 1977 to 1985, catalogued in verse the misery of disappearances and crackdowns on progressive writers. Faiz was already dead when I first heard those words, driving around Karachi in my father’s car a few years after Pakistan’s return to democracy in 1986. Speaking out was risky even then, with new and surreptitious tactics replacing the visible oppressions of military dictatorship. Who spoke, who continued speaking and who survived the clampdown were crucial and complicated questions in the first breaths of a fragile democracy.

Yet it is Faiz’s words that come to me today as I write the last words of what has been a fairly regular dialogue with my readers at Al Jazeera America (AJAM), words that will be published on the last day of its online existence. In a media landscape that is fervent and ferocious, littered with deaths and births and dominated by a few giants, Al Jazeera editors gave me a platform to speak whatever must be said.

It was a coup for me. I inhabit the margins between the United States and Pakistan, living in the schizophrenia of perspectives that is familiar to all whose belonging is not tied to one location on the map. I wrote for various American publications before AJAM launched in 2013, but my hyphenated identity permitted editors to subtract from my qualification as a commentator, a word that in their lexicon rhymed with insider. The academic qualifications I amassed in the U.S. (in true migrant tradition) were unreliable tickets to entry into an American media fray in which interesting others like me are spoken for but rarely given the space to speak themselves.

At AJAM, I tried to use my moment of speaking well. In its opinion section, which will be no more after today, I dissected not just what my color and race and national origin deem permissible but also many other human stories. I wrote about the right to die, Alzheimer’s disease, the whiteness of the Oscars, anti-gay legislation in Indiana, disaster relief in Nepal, the kidnapped schoolgirls of Nigeria and polygamy in Utah. The most successful op-ed I ever wrote came in April 2014. “The white tourist’s burden” underlined how the American desire for saviordom has found a new outlet in the volunteer tourism industry. It questioned the ethics of purchasing emotional highs catalyzed by the contrast between privilege and poverty, the seductive and reductive optics of being a Nepalese orphan or a Haitian family’s “only chance.” The piece was shared more than 51,000 times and provoked responses, including one on the Room for Debate blog at The New York Times. It is now required reading at several American universities that send students abroad.

To be clear, speaking is not simply the habitation of space and voice; it is also inherently dialectical, the product of a delicate dance of intellect between writer and editor. At AJAM, I worked with David Johnson and Mohammed Ademo, whose questions and queries, instructions and exhortations helped me construct the architecture of dissent from the passion of disagreement. They were rigorous interlocutors, incisive in their questions and their cuts, sharpening my prose and pushing my work to a precision that is crucial to op-ed writing.

There are places that writers always wish to go, pieces that they always wish to write, and then there are those assigned by editors around catastrophic events in the news cycle. I wrote “Lets talk about other dead journalists” days after the attack at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine, left 12 people dead. It is difficult to write in the shadow of such needless tragedy and even more so when an aspect of your identity is maligned as a portion of the murderous motivations. In the aftermath of grisly deaths, the facts of the massacre were fast appropriated into the easy and effortless rhetoric of cultural warfare, with Muslims always on the wrong side. The piece pointed out, only in numbers, that of the 61 journalists killed in 2014, more than half were Muslim. Muslims, too, die for speaking out, but their deaths are frequently erased from the landscape of journalistic courage."

CALAIS, France — Saturday is beauty day at the women’s center in the “Jungle” of Calais. It is a forest of tarps, tents, caravans and wooden structures, this camp that is home to an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 refugees. They come from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Eritrea and other war-torn countries. Calais, in the north of France, is the last stop before the English Channel. Winter here is often bitterly cold, with biting winds and driving rain. The women’s center is a dry and colorful cocoon, a refuge from the gray-brown mud of the camp. Inside, carpets and pillows colonize the floor, a woodburning stove gives off heat, and snacks and tea are on offer. Open strictly to women and young children, the center distributes female and infant supplies twice a week and holds a “beauty day” each weekend, during which residents and volunteers exchange massages, haircuts, threading and makeovers. At noon, the camp is still relatively quiet. For many of the residents, particularly those who spend nights making dangerous and often futile attempts to get to the United Kingdom, late morning is prime sleeping time. “Every week we hear of some people who succeed and others who die jumping onto trains or hanging onto ferries,” says Philli Boyle, the Calais manager of Help Refugees, a British aid group. A few minutes’ walk from the women’s center is Jungle Books, a free lending library, and nearby is a children’s library and art center. Next door is an all-ages classroom where French and English classes are offered, and several yards away is Jungala Radio's studio, where a refugee-made radio broadcast is produced. With help from volunteers and aid organizations, the camp has become a place of learning, art, music, theater and intellectual exchange. These sanctuaries in the Jungle help create a sense of community for refugees fleeing violence and uncertainty, but security is fragile and elusive. No one is officially running the camp, and it can seem anarchic and volatile, with internal fights, clashes with police or attacks on residents by right-wing extremists. That the Jungle operates as well as it does, with the presence of cultural, religious and social organizations, commerce and schools, is a testament to the hard work of volunteers and the resilience and initiative of residents. But all these places will be razed starting this week if the French government proceeds with a planned evacuation of a southern part of the Jungle, which officials say now houses too many people. Other buildings in the bulldozers’ path include temporary homes, a church and three mosques, two other volunteer-run schools, legal aid and vaccination centers, three food distribution centers, cafés, shops, restaurants and a theater.

“All of these places offer a sense of dignity, normalcy and psychological well-being that will be destroyed if the camp is bulldozed as planned,” says Boyle. Last week, eight organizations working in the camp, including Doctors Without Borders, sent an open letter to French Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve, urging him to reconsider the demolition. The area of the camp slated for demolition is home to anywhere from 800 to 3,500 refugees. The government estimates there are 800 to 1,000 people currently living in the area to be leveled, but a census conducted by Help Refugees last week found that the number is closer to 3,500, which includes 445 children and youth, 305 of whom are unaccompanied. The presence of the makeshift refugee camp in Calais has become a source of heated debate in the city, where the Jungle’s presence has intensified already heated discussions over immigration. Early this month, Fabienne Buccio, a top government official in the region, announced plans to raze half the settlement. Though it is difficult to count the exact number of people in the Jungle, early last summer, an estimated 1,500 people were living here. By November, that number had quadrupled. The growth of the camp and the transformation of Calais — the town is now heavily patrolled by police, and miles of barbed wire and fences have been constructed around highways, fields and the city’s port — are sources of much tension in the region. Some residents living in houses across from the Jungle complain of feeling unsafe, and the situation has lent fodder to right-wing extremists and neo-Nazi groups. Earlier this month, dozens of people were arrested at a protest organized by the extremist organization PEGIDA (the acronym in German for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West). There have also been allegations of attacks on refugees by vigilante and extremist groups in the area. There is a chance that the bulldozers won’t come, or at least not so soon: A judge from the administrative court in the northern city of Lille visited the camp this morning to evaluate the situation and is expected to give a ruling concerning the evacuation sometime tomorrow or Thursday. For now, orders to residents to leave today by 8 p.m. have been suspended.

The government has said there are two options for Jungle residents: Either relocate to one of the 102 reception and orientation centers across France or move into the nearby block of housing made from converted shipping containers that was opened by the government last month. The government-run housing block, designed expressly for refugees and located on the edge of the camp, has 1,500 beds (12 bunk beds per shipping container), heat and electricity. As of Feb. 22, only 200 of the 1,500 spaces remained. While the container housing is sturdier than tents, it lacks kitchens and running water. Surrounded by fences, the container settlement is reminiscent of internment camps during World World II. Perhaps most worrying to potential occupants is that they are required to have their palm prints taken to live here.

Local French authorities say they want to house up to 1,500 of the Jungle’s refugees to converted shipping containers. Philippe Huguen / AFP / Getty Images For many residents, leaving biometric data in France is the last thing they want. While the European Union is still grappling with how to deal with the massive increase in asylum seekers over the past year, generally someone who passes through a country where he or she could have sought asylum can be forced to return there to make a claim. And most of the Calais camp’s residents are headed to the U.K., not France. Job prospects are perceived to be much better in England because many refugees already speak English or have family in the U.K. One of them, Naqib Lodin, 24, worked as a pharmacist in Afghanistan before fleeing his country six months ago. During his four months in the Jungle, he volunteered as a librarian at Jungle Books and dedicated himself to learning English. “I’m alone, and I’ve found some friends here,” he says. “Language classes gave me something to do. Thinking too much isn’t good — it’s better for our mental health to have something to do.” Several posters drawn by Lodin decorate the walls of Jungle Books, including one that advises, “Didn’t make it to England — keep calm and come to English classes.” The message is autobiographical, he explains, describing how he hid underneath a truck to cross the channel, making it as far as Brighton before being sent back to France. He is not confident about trying again to reach England. “It’s too dangerous,” he says.

Philippe Huguen / AFP / Getty Images In recent days, aid groups and residents have been doing all they can to urge the government not to destroy the camp. The Good Chance Theatre, a U.K. arts project that organizes classes and events in the Jungle, has been instrumental in bringing attention to the camp. Earlier this month, actors from London’s Shakespeare’s Globe theater performed in the Jungle’s geodesic dome playhouse. On Sunday celebrities — including actor Jude Law, singer Tom Odell and playwright Tom Stoppard — visited to show their support and read letters, including those written by refugees living in the camp. “Dear People of Europe,” begins a letter written by a man who gives his name only as Hossein. “Children, women, fathers and brothers just want to live. Now they are fleeing from their home and countries, you call them refugees. They are humiliated in Europe. Children, instead of drawing sweet childhood memories, are drawing the cold of winter, lack of water and food, disease and standing in the camp’s long queues. This will put the history of the 21st century to shame.” Another letter, hung in the entryway to the theater, tells the story of Muhammed, a 26-year-old civil engineer from Afghanistan. The letter describes his past working as a translator for British troops and the subsequent threats he endured from the Taliban. He appealed to the British government, which, according to the letter, offered him $1,075 in aid to help him hide from the Taliban. After traveling through Turkey and Greece and finally reaching Calais, he has been unable to reach the U.K., his final destination, despite several attempts. The Sunday letter reading was performed in English and translated into Arabic, Farsi, Pashto and Kurdish. In addition to guest appearances by celebrities, the afternoon featured artistic performances by refugees living in the camp, including one by Ismail Nazari, a musician who fled Afghanistan after being tortured by the Taliban. During the performance, Nazari played his handmade dombura, a delicate, long-necked stringed instrument that survived the trip from Afghanistan to France. The 29-year-old currently lives in the Jungle with his wife and three children and sang a song dedicated to his mother.

In addition to communal spaces and social services set up by aid organizations across the camp, there are popular venues set up by refugees themselves. Lunch in one of the locally run Afghan restaurants features plates heaped with steaming rice, fried eggplant, spinach and chickpeas and warm rounds of chewy bread. Plastic cups of hot, milky tea are passed around, sweet on the tongue and warm on the fingers. Across the road, bags of lemons and oranges hang in front of a shop run by a refugee. There are several such stores scattered throughout the Jungle, selling snacks, drinks, toilet paper and cigarettes. Despite these suggestions of normalcy, it doesn’t take much to remind one that life in the camp is anything but. On Saturday afternoon, panic breaks out and people carrying a wounded man run through the mud-slicked thoroughfare of the camp. According to reports published that evening, an Afghan man was hit by a bullet in his spinal column during a fight that broke out between several camp residents and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. This, too, is life in the Jungle. Kathy O’Hare, one of the founders of Jungala Radio, a broadcast made for and by refugees, describes daily conditions as extremely challenging. “To put a deadline on a story wouldn’t function at all,” she says. “You have to remember that everybody comes in to work that day thinking they’re leaving tomorrow.” There is also the question of logistics. Internet connection is poor, and everyone is cold this time of year. “We start late in the day because people are so cold during the night that it’s hard to sleep. You also have the constant tear-gassing by police in the night, and that all contributes to lack of sleep and general psychological well-being,” says O’Hare."

They have done this by embracing the broken-windows theory, which erroneously argues that aggressive crackdowns on minor legal violations leads to a general climate of civility and lawfulness despite quantitative and qualitative analyses that have shown the idea to be more myth than theory. Broken-windows policing is supposed to revitalize poor and crime-ridden neighborhoods by stopping, frisking and arresting hundreds of thousands of poor, young and homeless people — most of whom are nonwhite — for a variety of minor nuisance crimes, giving them life time arrest records and involving them in an increasingly unforgiving criminal justice system.

While the images show symptoms of real problems that make life in cities more difficult for both those who are homeless and those who are not, the union’s actions were driven by the more cynical goals of resurrecting the widely discredited and deeply conservative broken-windows theory, pushing back against new accountability mechanisms and undermining the progressive politics of Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Despite this defense, the photos and videos were removed from Flickr on Friday. The SBA denied responsibility and objected to the move, saying, “The images were removed without our knowledge by Flickr for reasons we can only speculate on but add up to censorship at its worst.” The union promised that a website for the pictures was under construction and would launch soon.

The SBA’s recent posting of photographs of homeless people on the Flickr social networking site was in no way intended to demean or humiliate one of the city’s most vulnerable populations. The motivation for posting those photos, as well as photos of people engaged in criminal activity and quality of life offenses, was to illuminate the increasing sense of frustration among residents, workers and visitors to the city and to hold elected officials and purported civic leaders accountable for the diminishing quality of life in all five boroughs.

This public posting of photos and videos has sparked popular outcry and criticism. In response, the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA) has insisted on the value of the project:

Last week the New York Police Department sergeants’ union inserted itself into local politics yet again when it urged its members and supporters to document the declining quality of life in the city by taking pictures and videos of homeless people, panhandlers and low-level drug dealers and posting them on its Flickr page .

If the SBA was serious about addressing the quality of life in the city, its members would have spoken out over the last 20 years as the number of homeless people consistently increased.

The police in New York worry that their prime position will be displaced by de Blasio’s proposals to replace some police functions with targeted programs to address the underlying causes of disorder without involving the criminal justice system. His administration has put more resources into community-based anti-violence initiatives, stopped arresting people for possessing small amounts of marijuana, developed plans to keep juvenile offenders out of the court and jail systems and is putting together more meaningful services for homeless and mentally ill people so they don’t end up in the criminal justice system. All of this reduces the centrality of police in managing low-level crime and disorder problems.

The cops are also upset about a series of bills before the City Council that would enhance public accountability for their actions and discourage some of their more abusive tactics such as intimidating people into allowing searches of their person or vehicles in the absence of probable cause. They seem to think the homelessness campaign will illustrate recent attempts to reduce police power as enabling a public free-for-all in which homeless people are allowed to run amok in the streets. The truth is that aggressive quality of life policing has shown its ability to drive people out of public and into the jail system, but it has done nothing to improve their quality of life or reduce the level of homelessness.

Unfortunately, de Blasio has made himself vulnerable to these histrionic accusations because record numbers of people are homeless in the city and services for them, people with mental illness and people with substance abuse issues are clearly inadequate to meet demand. The mayor has called for more, but real improvements remain to be seen, especially in the area of supportive housing and safe haven shelters, which hold the best chances of getting people with serious mental health and substance use issues off the streets.

If the SBA was serious about addressing the quality of life in the city, its members would have spoken out over the last 20 years as the number of homeless people consistently increased. Their failure to do so may be tied to the fact that so many of the union’s members live in suburban counties rather than the city. They are essentially publicly degrading homeless people as a hammer to wield against a mayor they resent. And they’re doing it in the most callous way possible.

The irony is that de Blasio has done very little to directly undermine their position. This year, he authorized the hiring of 1,300 additional police officers. He has gone to great lengths to emphasize that he fully supports quality of life policing initiatives, including the deployment of more officers this summer to address low-level violations, all in keeping with the broken-windows theory that he explicitly supports.

This call to shock the public and embarrass the mayor is an ideological battle and an embarrassment. Police officers, like any other workers, have the right to organize themselves, and their union is not the only one to participate in politics. Still, the public, the media and politicians should judge the officers’ political actions critically, given their structurally powerful role.

And the police need to stop using vulnerable and disenfranchised people to make a political point. Groups like Picture the Homeless are documenting extensive abusive policing aimed at homeless people. Calls for more crackdowns — on homelessness, vagrancy and other minor crimes — will hurt the quality of life for all of us, not improve it."

Police estimated at least 879,000 people joined the nationwide demonstrations. Rousseff, who was re-elected to a second term by a whisker 10 months ago, has seen her approval rating dip over the past few months. There is now little confidence in her ability to govern effectively and get Brazil's economy back into the black.

Rousseff faces a skeptical electorate but impeachment is unlikely. Most Brazilian analysts agree that there are no grounds for impeachment without evidence of responsibility for crimes committed during her tenure. Similarly, while Rousseff's unsuccessful and interventionist fiscal policy during her first term set the current recession in motion, economic mismanagement is not an impeachable offense.

However, if forced through on a technicality rather than clear evidence of willful wrongdoing, Rousseff’s impeachment would be calamitous for political stability and therefore the economy, taking Brazil to dark places not visited since the military dictatorship that ended three decades ago.

Rousseff has the worst approval rating ever recorded by the Brazilian polling institute Datafolha. Only about eight percent of the 3,363 people surveyed across Brazil in early August thought highly of her, while a record 71 percent disapproved of her government. In the same poll, about 66 percent of Brazilians believed Rousseff should be impeached now.

I spoke with a cross-section of protesters at the demonstrations in São Paulo on Sunday. There was no consensus on Rousseff’s future. Some protesters said impeachment could rid the country of an incompetent leader, while others believed it was pointless because another “equally mediocre” leader would take over. Others came to simply voice their dissatisfaction with corruption and the government’s handling of the economy.

But the protesters’ grievances were largely justified. The economy, already in recession, is expected to shrink this year and next, while inflation and unemployment both swell. On Aug. 11, Moody’s credit rating agency downgraded Brazilian debt perilously close to junk territory and warned that the current political chaos was unsustainable. Brazilians are tired of Rousseff blaming outside influences such as the global financial crisis for the slump rather than shouldering some of the responsibility herself.

The sprawling corruption scandal at Petrobras has brought the country's biggest company to its knees and pummeled the economy. Dozens of politicians from Rousseff's ruling coalition are now under investigation. Rousseff chaired the Petrobras board of directors from 2003 to 2010, when much of the vast kickback scheme allegedly whirred into action. Her opponents argue that even if Rousseff did not benefit financially, it is highly unlikely she was unaware of the scheme, through which prosecutors say billions of dollars were skimmed off inflated contracts between Petrobras and construction companies and funneled to political parties, enriching everyone involved. She has denied any knowledge and has been cleared by investigators.

But this hasn’t stopped the impeachment advocates from mobilizing the public. There are alternative impeachment attempts afoot. Eduardo Cunha, speaker of Brazil's Lower House, is now leading the impeachment bandwagon after declaring war on the government over accusations, based on testimony from Júlio Camargo, a lobbyist turned state witness for the Petrobras graft investigation, that the congressional leader had taken bribes. Cunha denies the allegations and maintains Camargo was pressured into naming him, but prosecutors on Aug. 20 filed charges against him."

The real estate mogul and reality TV star who wants to be president put out a document he called a tax plan. Like many of his business deals, it is long on boastfulness and short on money to pay the inevitable bills. Trump told “60 Minutes” that his plan will work because “overall, it’s going to be a tremendous incentive to grow the economy and we’re going to take in the same or more money … We’re gonna grow the economy so much.” He would cut the top tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent, cut the corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and eliminate the estate tax so the children of billionaires inherit tax-free. (Most of the estate tax falls on economic gains that have never been taxed, as I showed in my book “Perfectly Legal”.) That sounds like more of the tried and failed Republican tax policies of the past 35 years. Trump says he can make up for the lost tax revenue partly by requiring hedge-fund managers to pay at the top tax rate and ending corporate tax deferrals — something I have championed for years. But there’s just dimes in these proposals to offset lost dollars. He would also eliminate the income tax for 75 million households, up from the 53 million households in 2013, by exempting the first $25,000 of earnings from tax, double that for married couples. Currently about 36 percent of tax returns show no tax owed, mostly because people are poor (about 35 million households) or have children who qualify for the $1,000 per child tax credit championed by Republicans in Congress.

Tax breaks for me, not thee

Speaking of children, assuming Trump is worth the $10 billion he claims (his election disclosures indicate its likely closer to $1 billion), his five children would save about $800 million each in taxes on their inheritances from his estate-tax repeal. That would seem to put his children in the same situation as hotel scion Barron Hilton, whom Trump once dismissed because he owed his riches to being a member of “the lucky sperm club.” Trump also says he would close loopholes to raise revenue, but does not say which. That’s interesting because Trump benefits from an outrageous loophole, a 1990s tax-code change that let’s people who work just 15 hours a week in real estate live tax-free. All you need is a enough buildings so that your annual write down for depreciation exceeds your income from other sources such as, say, a television show and royalties for putting your name on neckties made in China. Everyone who does not qualify for this loophole is limited to offsetting no more than $25,000 of earned income with depreciation.

Trump the would-be tax cutter also promises to be Trump the big spender.

I wonder if we will ever see Trump’s tax returns and learn just how much he saves because of this loophole. Early in his career, his tax returns showed that paper losses from real estate were so huge he escaped income taxes, as I revealed in “Temples of Chance,” my 1992 book on Trump and other casino moguls.

Laughable

When I read the Trump tax plan, vagaries and all, I literally burst out laughing at its fairy tales. But I also knew most people would not understand that his plan was fantasy wrapped in deception, Trump’s art of the con. Having spent five decades studying taxes I know the Trump tax is as realistic as human transporters. Having covered Trump on and off since 1988, I also knew that reporters would faithfully regurgitate his plan with no more than a dash of skepticism. The Trump tax cannot do anything but create economic disaster. But don’t take my word for it; take the word of one of the leading opponents of taxes in America, the nonprofit Tax Foundation. Its computer model shows that federal revenues would drop by almost $12 trillion in the next decade. That is well more than a third of what the government is expected to collect in individual and corporate income taxes in ten years after President Barack Obama leaves office so the annual federal deficit would balloon. Under President Obama the annual budget deficit has shrunk by two-thirds to 2.5 percent of the economy, which is less than the average of George W. Bush budgets. By contrast, Trump’s plan would put the deficit deep into double digits. But it’s actually much worse than that, as the Tax Foundation’s disclaimers show. Its computer model ignores such basics as “fiscal or economic effects of interest on debt” and “does not require budgets to balance over the long term.” The Tax Foundation also ignores the effects of spending cuts (or increases) on the economy overall.

National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden called it the “the most important tech case in a decade,” and in many ways he’s absolutely right. Apple has been on the front lines of the tech privacy fight ever since it improved the security of its devices such that no one, not even the company itself, would be technically capable of accessing their stored data. Now, facing a standstill in Congress, the U.S. government has ordered the company to build a custom version of the iOS operating system that would disable the iPhone’s security features, allowing FBI investigators to crack the passcode protecting the device by trying every possible combination — a method known as “brute force.”

The order is unprecedented. At stake is whether the U.S. government can legally compel a company to create software that sabotages its own products in the name of fighting crime. In a scathing letter posted on Apple’s website, CEO Tim Cook announced the company’s intent to fight the order, saying it would set a “dangerous precedent” that would be ineffective against criminals and “would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on companies like Apple to protect their data.”

What’s more, many details of the case cast doubt on the value or existence of data supposedly contained on the device. It suggests the government’s real goal is actually setting this dangerous precedent — not unlocking a dead criminal’s phone.

Evidence of this strategy can be found in the order itself — including in its legal justification, the All Writs Act, a law that was enacted 277 years ago. The Act broadly allows courts to compel individuals and companies to do pretty much anything, as long as it aids the execution of a court order and isn’t unreasonably burdensome. Needless to say, its invocation in a case dealing with advanced technology is bizarre and smacks of desperation to many legal scholars. As the CATO Institute’s privacy law expert Julian Sanchez puts it, “The FBI [...] is relying on an 18th-century law to grant it powers that our 21st Congress won’t.”

Secondly, the FBI’s assertion that the phone contains valuable evidence is at odds with the known facts of the case. The court order notes that Farook destroyed several other phones to hide evidence prior to the attack. It’s extremely doubtful he’d neglect to destroy the remaining phone if it had any evidence on it. Another reason to be skeptical: The device was actually owned by Farook’s employer, the San Bernardino county health department. Given the lengths he went to destroy evidence, it’s highly unlikely Farook would plan attacks using a company device, since it would be reasonable to assume his employer might be monitoring it. The phone was discovered by agents with the “Find My iPhone” feature turned on — a very strange setting to have activated on a device being used to coordinate terrorist plots."

At a small fraction of the cost of most private schools, parochial education provided African-Americans with their only realistic alternative to failing public schools before the charter school era.

The most prominent pop culture reference to the presence of African-Americans in Catholic schools is the opening scene of “Sister Act,” in which Whoopi Goldberg’s character, Dolores, is first shown as a child attending a fictional Catholic school in California, St. Anne’s Academy, in 1968. The sequel, “Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit,” provided most Americans with their first glimpse of burgeoning musician Lauryn Hill.

In 1919 the country’s small African-American Catholic community established the Committee for the Advancement of Colored Catholics, which sought to attract converts by expanding the church’s educational outreach. With the success of the all-black Catholic college Xavier University in New Orleans (founded in 1914), the committee believed that by filling in the gap where public funding for black schools fell short (often resulting in understaffed classrooms), it could make the greatest gains in recruiting African-American members. The Great Migration, the large influx of black people to the North, provided the Catholic Church and its parish schools with a golden opportunity. In 1945, all Catholic schools in Chicago were made open to black students, a stunning move in a Northern city now infamous for intense segregation through redlining.

Parochial schools have a long and rich history. The first official Catholic school open to African-Americans was founded in Washington, D.C., in 1827 by Sister Maria Becraft as a school for free black girls at the Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown. The Oblate Sisters of Providence, the first order of black nuns in the U.S., opened the St. Frances Academy for Colored Girls in Baltimore in June 1828, with offshoots soon appearing in Philadelphia and New Orleans.

One could write that off as owing to the paucity of black Catholics; they make up only 3 percent of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. However, this discrepancy belies the fact that for two centuries now, Catholic schools in inner-city communities have been serving African-American students whose families perceived parochial schools as better alternatives to the neglected and underfunded public schools in their districts.

When Pope Francis took his historic visit to the United States, much of the media attention was on the pope’s focus on the Latino community, particularly on the subject of immigration. This is understandable: According to Pew Research surveys, a third of U.S. Catholics identify as Hispanic. But there was little coverage of the pope in relation to African-Americans.

From grades 4 through 8, I attended an almost entirely African-American Catholic school in Philadelphia, Cecilian Academy. Remarkably, almost none of us were Catholic. The students were predominately Baptist and Methodist, with some Muslims and still fewer Catholics. Alongside the nuns (who were all white), there was an African-American Catholic vice principal who had been active in the civil rights movement. She combined her Catholic faith with black pride cultural politics and infused that into the fabric of the school.

During my time at Cecilian Academy (named after St. Cecilian, the patron saint of music), we learned traditional African songs, and we sang the black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” at our monthly Mass. We had an annual African-American history bee that was the event of the year. In the seventh grade, my class put on a play about the Harlem Renaissance, and in the eighth grade, we produced a musical about African-American jazz performers. (I played Ella Fitzgerald.) When I recall my time there, what strikes me the most is that this Catholic school had been transformed into a black pride center full of non-Catholics — and no one found it odd. I recently came across a volume of essays, titled “Growing Up African-American in Catholic Schools,” full of stories that speak to the kind of eclectic cultural experience I had in Catholic school. While Catholic schools in black communities were intended to evangelize us, we transformed Catholic schools into hybrid spaces to suit our own needs.

Cecilian Academy has since closed its doors, as has another Catholic church that served the African-American neighborhood where I grew up. The widespread closure of Catholic schools in inner-city neighborhoods has gotten some attention from journalists and researchers. According to the research from the National Catholic Education Association, from 2004 to 2014, nearly 2,000 Catholic schools in the U.S. were shut down or consolidated. The number of Catholic elementary schools in the 12 largest cities declined 29.5 percent over that period. Higher operating costs associated with the decline of religious orders (which once provided practically free labor in the form of nuns) have led to tuition hikes, driving down enrollment figures in cities like New Orleans where poor black families rely on small state vouchers. Finances alone aren’t the only issue, as inner-city Catholic schools, particularly those serve predominately African-Americans, have been shutting at faster rates than those in mostly white, Catholic communities, suggesting that the archdioceses have grown tired of investing so much of its resources into non-Catholic students who have historically not converted after attending parish schools. I went on to attend a public high school, and I haven’t attended a Mass since.

In the coverage of Francis’ speech to Congress, there was some mention of his reference to Martin Luther King Jr. in his address, an act many interpreted as a papal hat tip to Black Lives Matter. But in his visit to Our Lady Queen of Angels School in Harlem, the pope invoked another bygone era of black politics, when Catholics and African-Americans worshiped and studied side by side in far greater numbers than they do now.

I braved the crowds to see Francis in downtown Philadelphia. When his Jeep Wrangler sped by, I wondered what it must feel like for Catholics to see the pope, what it must be like to have a personal connection to that figure we saw drive by. Then I remembered that I too, as an African-American, have a claim on the complex history of the Catholic Church in the United States."

From November 2010 to September 2011, more than 250,000 communications between U.S. diplomats that were never meant to see the light of day were made public. They are available at WikiLeaks, the nonprofit media organization that accepts confidential information from anonymous sources and releases it to news sources and the public. A number of researchers have put together a treasure trove of information and analysis that can be immensely clarifying. (The recently released book from this research, published by Verso, is “The WikiLeaks Files: The World According to U.S. Empire.”)

Consider Syria, which is dominating the international news because of increased Russian military intervention as well as a surge of some 500,000 refugees from the region arriving in Europe. Why has it taken so long for Washington to even begin — yes, it is unfortunately just beginning — to reconsider the policy of requiring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to agree to resign before any meaningful negotiations can take place? After all, any diplomat could have told the White House that demanding the political suicide of one party to a civil war as a condition for negotiations is not how civil wars end. Practically speaking, this policy has been a commitment to indefinite warfare.

The answer can be found in diplomatic communications released by WikiLeaks, which show that regime change in Syria has been the policy of the U.S. government as far back as 2006. Even more horrifying — after hundreds of thousands of deaths, untold lives ruined and more than 4 million refugees fleeing the country — is the evidence that Washington has had a policy of promoting sectarian warfare in the country for the purpose of destabilizing the Assad government. A cable from the top U.S. embassy official (the chargé d’affaires) in Damascus in December 2006 offers suggestions for how Washington could exacerbate and take advantage of certain “vulnerabilities” of the government of Syria. Vulnerabilities to be exploited include “the presence of transiting Islamist extremists” and “Sunni fears of Iranian influence.”

Describing this strategy in “The WikiLeaks Files,” Robert Naiman writes:

At that time, no one in the U.S. government could credibly have claimed innocence of the possible implications of such a policy. This cable was written at the height of the sectarian Sunni-Shia civil war in Iraq, which the U.S. military was unsuccessfully trying to contain. U.S. public disgust with the sectarian civil war in Iraq unleashed by the U.S. invasion had just cost Republicans control of Congress in the November 2006 election. The election result immediately precipitated the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld as secretary of defense. No one working for the U.S. government on foreign policy at the time could have been unaware of the implications of promoting Sunni-Shia sectarianism.

The cables also show that U.S. support for efforts to overthrow the Syrian government beginning in 2011 were not a response to the Assad government’s repression of protests but rather a continuation of a years-long strategy by more directly violent means. They explain why the U.S. government could get so carried away by the protests and then the armed struggle that it helped to promote as to ignore what a large number of Syrians, were thinking: Whatever they thought of Assad, a glance at the mess in Iraq (even before the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) showed that a much worse fate for their country was possible."

Laws and cultural norms have shifted to create new opportunities, better access and a relatively more inclusive society. And yet people with disabilities, their caregivers, families and allies have never been more aware of the many barriers they face. We encounter these barriers not just in our own lives but also through social media, with individual struggles shared more easily, revealing patterns of discrimination and exclusion. For parents, that struggle is nowhere more apparent than in schools.

“The school district is not accountable for whether your child receives the best education for them or even a good education,” a lawyer for a rural Midwestern school wrote in a recent letter to the mother of a child with Down syndrome. “The district is legally required to provide the minimum … and that is what we are doing.” (Names have been withheld to protect the child from retaliation, since the dispute is ongoing.)

Here is the worst part: The attorney is not necessarily wrong. All schools have to do is the minimum and they can skate right on by.

I am acutely aware of these challenges. My son, Nico, has Down syndrome and has just finished second grade at a lovely public elementary school in a suburb of Chicago. His teachers and the school’s support team are well trained and appear to be people of goodwill. Yet I spent much of the year growing increasingly upset about the ways in which he is excluded from academic and enrichment activities.

He spends in-school social time with his classmates (recess, lunch, art, gym, music), but very little academic time. We regularly got notes about events in which he was not included. Sometimes we found out about opportunities only after they had passed, because although our son communicates effectively in many ways, expressive speech remains a challenge. While neurotypical kids generally tell their parents about upcoming school events, we sometimes miss messages buried in bags, if we get a message at all. Every Pajama Day or Spirit Day is an opportunity for Nico’s differences to stand out.

Class assignments were sent home with no guidance as to how or whether Nico might take part. During an annual musical performance in March, we received an email that said every child was to wear a shirt matching his or her mask, but Nico’s teacher told us she hadn’t seen a mask for him. Last month the teacher put on Readers Theater (in which kids acted out books) and told us in an email that “Nico would get to participate as an audience member.”

I am in regular conversation with parents across the U.S. who are struggling through much more difficult situations, whether from abuse, mockery or just general resistance to meeting a child’s needs. Sometimes school districts are resistant to change, claiming they are not required to provide the best option for students, instead opting to offer the bare minimum to students with disabilities. It’s too easy for special education to turn into baby-sitting.

In the past, children with disabilities faced two possibilities: Be diagnosed and segregated or be undiagnosed and have their needs ignored. These outcomes reflected the social and medical norms of their times. Today we’re much better at diagnosing disabilities. For example, the growth in autism diagnoses is largely due to diagnostic shifts in the Western world. Moreover, our school systems now offer a variety of models to discover the least restrictive environment (LRE) to provide a free and appropriate public education (FAPE), thanks to the 1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) and a series of reauthorizations, renamings and some expansions."

While the dispute over the Southern Kuril Islands (referred to as the Northern Territories by Japan) often does not receive the same attention as Japan’s territorial squabbles with China and South Korea, Tokyo is embroiled in a seven-decade-old row with Moscow over the islands’ sovereignty. Abe is wary of Russia’s increasingly close ties with China, as evidenced by their joint naval exercise in the Sea of Japan last month.

Abe’s desire to resolve the Kuril spat and enhance ties with Russia, which has the potential to become an even larger supplier of energy to Japan, prompted a diplomatic offensive after he took office in late 2012. He has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin more than 10 times since then and even took the politically risky move of attending the opening ceremony for the Sochi Olympics. (Leaders from the rest of the G-7 boycotted the event.) Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year and its continued meddling in eastern Ukraine have complicated diplomatic avenues for Abe. He faces the choice of salvaging his Russia policy or standing firm with the international community and especially Japan’s ally in Washington.

Through Abe’s diplomatic overtures, there was some hope that Japan and Russia might finally be able to resolve their territorial dispute and sign a peace treaty to officially conclude their hostilities from World War II. But relations have soured precipitously because of Japan’s imposition of sanctions against Russia for its role in Ukraine. Tokyo has been forced to apply the brakes on its engagement with Russia and postponed a long-planned visit by Putin later this year.

Abe’s pragmatic embrace of Russia is now in tatters. On the contentious issue of the Kuril Islands, both sides have failed to gain traction toward a compromise. Japan’s official policy remains that all four of the southern islands — Kunashiri, Etorofu, Habomai and Shikotan — be returned to its administration. Unofficially, Tokyo has been exploring potential compromises on this position such as splitting administration of islands or deferring the issue of sovereignty for the foreseeable future. While Russia contemplated splitting the islands in the early years of the dispute, Moscow has recently shown no willingness to cede any territory back to Japan."

Malik’s post was made from an account with another name, and officials provided no confirmation of how they connected it to her, but U.S. media outlets were eager to identify her as the mastermind of the plot. Within hours of the assault, the assassins’ apartment was thrown open to nearly 100 journalists and curious bystanders. Reporters scrambled to add some sinister flavors to otherwise banal contents of a humdrum household. With cameras in tow, gasping television anchors pilfered through baby toys and kitchen cabinets. They peered through closets where Malik’s clothes still hung and into the crib where her baby once slept. They scanned the toilet and the bathroom counter. “There are a lot of signs of faith,” a CNN anchor declared emphatically, pointing at a Quran lying on a bed at the apartment. The Washington Post labeled Malik an “enigmatic woman”; Fox News reported there was a “very serious possibility” that she radicalized her American-born husband, Syed Rizwan Farook. In the Conservative Review, columnist Daniel Horowitz — who, like presidential candidate Donald Trump, called for a ban on all Islamic immigration — questioned how many Maliks had already been admitted to the United States. Many in the media remain focused on efforts to pin most of the blame on a terrorist bride who came to the United States under a fiancée visa and then lured her husband into mass killing. The posthumous burning of Malik at the stake before a traumatized nation reiterates that terrorism is something foreign, imported and unrelated to the exclusions and alienations that are being bred at home. The notion of an ISIL plant as the instigator of grotesque carnage feeds into existing societal misogyny, in which the inexplicably evil is neatly made equal to the Muslim and female. The realities of escalating mass shootings, immigration laws that promote domestic abuse and a nation divided over gun control are too vexing — better ignored or covered up by a seductive story about a scheming terrorist bride who led her impressionable husband to murder.

Malik’s story

It is not possible to take apart a dead murderer’s motivations or her silent sympathies, but it is important to consider the known facts and conditions of her life. Few details are known of what Malik did in the days before the attack — her doings, her friends or her feelings. None of this is surprising; most South Asian women who arrive in the United States as brides lead solitary lives organized around taking care of the men who brought them here. Malik wore a burqa in public, but all women in Saudi Arabia, where relatives and acquaintances of hers said she was raised, are required to wear a burqa or abaya. So if conservatism equals radicalism, all Saudi women must be rounded up. Several media outlets cited Al-Huda religious school in Pakistan, where Malik took some classes, as a possible inspiration for her radicalism, but the school, while conservative, has no known links to militancy. Interestingly, the fiancée visa on which Malik came to the United States is difficult to obtain in Pakistan, where increased consular scrutiny often requires legal marriage to take place before validating immigration to the United States. The rules in Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally, may be different; if more than $1.25 billion in bombs can be sold to Riyadh, fiancé visas with less stringent processing than other Muslim countries could probably be added to the mix. Regardless, U.S. rules governing marriage-based immigration support the project of control and confine. Sponsored spouses may obtain work authorization only on the basis of the marriage. And they lose their status as legal permanent residents and could be deported if they do not stay married and cohabitate for at least two years. In lived terms, a wife cannot work without her husband’s permission, and she risks losing her right to stay in the country if the marriage fails.

In casting Malik as a scheming terrorist bride – female, foreign and radicalized – Americans avoid confronting the possibility that this was yet another act of domestic terrorism carried out by an American man."

This makes family visits and connection with the community harder, though studies show that inmates who receive more visits are less likely to re-offend after release.

Prisoners can’t vote in the United States and as a result they don’t have much sway over public policy decisions. But private, for-profit prison companies do, their voices amplified by big campaign contributions and millions spent on lobbying. Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, some of the candidates’ ties to the prison-industrial complex raise a lot of questions. For example, the GEO Group has contributed heavily to campaigns of Florida senator and Republican contender Marco Rubio. And Republican candidate Jeb Bush’s support of for-profit prisons goes back to the 1990s, when he oversaw prison privatization as Florida governor.

Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton is calling for criminal justice reform, which would reduce profits for private prisons and reduce mass incarceration. The election offers voters a choice between candidates who support the current system that allows corporations to profit from the misery of the inmates and those committed to fundamental reform, which includes changing inflexible sentencing laws and ending the for-profit prison system.

Washington’s contract with the GEO Group is part of the boom in for-profit prisons, whose inmate population increased by 1,600 percent from 1980 to 2009. The privatization of prisons and prison services accelerated during former President Bill Clinton’s administration based on promises of cost savings and better treatment for inmates. For-profit prisons have delivered on neither.

Government-run prisons frequently fail in rehabilitation, in providing medical care and in protecting prisoners from abuse. But private prisons do worse. Poorly paid and inadequately trained guards make for-profit prisons dangerous for staff and prisoners alike. In a 2001 study, the National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD) reported a higher incidence of assaults on prisoners by guards at private prisons than in state and federal prisons.

The U.S. Constitution prohibits cruel or unusual punishment of inmates. Increasingly, private prisons fail to meet even that minimal standard. One egregious example is the Bureau of Prisons’ contracts that require 10 percent of private prison beds to be set aside for solitary confinement. Because private prisons profit from keeping all beds full, this results in overuse and abuse of solitary confinement (PDF). This includes instances where immigrant mothers were punished with solitary confinement for protesting deplorable conditions at detention centers."

He is reviving a party that lost two elections by leaning to the right, and his version of the Labour Party gives the capitalist class an actual ideological opponent by simply agreeing with British voters (of all persuasions) on the renationalization of the railroads, scrapping nuclear weapons and tuition fees and taxing the rich.

They have reason to worry. Corbyn’s straightforward way of putting forth his arguments makes other politicians sound like soulless robots, with their PR-crafted platitudes. Syriza (in its admittedly watered-down state, after Alexis Tsipras signed up for more austerity, split the party and was forced to resign and call for elections) has endorsed him as its candidate of choice to lead Labour.

Activists on the far left who joined Labour just to vote for him are labeled entryists who don’t share the party’s values. (Though what those values are post–Tony Blair is unclear.) Right-wing commentators worry that he will drag the political center to the left and that the spotlight he would enjoy as the leader of the opposition would lend his ideas more credibility.

To give an example of how unlikely an occurrence this is, picture Bernie Sanders beating Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination by 25 points. But, as Sanders does in the U.S., Jez faces an uphill battle with public opinion. The mainstream press still regards Corbyn as an outsider; left-wing activists see him as a danger to Labour and British political life in general . His socialist politics are seen as outdated; the term “unelectable” always seems to come up in his news coverage.

Jez arrived at the right moment. After a resounding defeat in the hands of the Conservative Party in May, Labour suffered something of an identity crisis. Its former leader Ed Miliband resigned before the party could even begin thinking about who came next. Initially, Corbyn was regarded as a token candidate of the marginal left, but he has since inspired a wave of people to join Labour, and polls show he is the front-runner by a huge margin .

A 66-year-old pescatarian has electrified the British electorate, and if polls hold , he might just be the next leader of the center-left Labour Party come Sept. 17. Timid and ascetic, he is Jeremy Corbyn, or Jez to his supporters, and he has provided a much-needed shot in the arm for the anti-austerity movement in the U.K., winning him comparisons to the leaders of Podemos and Syriza.

But while Corbyn is a sound socialist with his heart in the right place, his charisma is limited. His ex-wife complained that, as a young man, he opted to photocopy political pamphlets and eat cold beans from a can over taking her out on dates. He is regrettably not the man to lead a mass movement of the left against austerity and neoliberalism.

But that doesn’t mean Corbyn can’t be the beginning of something. His main asset is to show those on the left that they need to up their game. That said, his party needs to be more realistic about his long-term prospects. Jez will not save Britain — but whoever comes after him could.

In trying to take Corbyn down, his critics have emphasized his foreign policy record. His association with Iranian state broadcaster Press TV — on which he hosted a show — and the fact that he called Hamas and Hezbollah his “friends” in the Palestinian territories fuel many accusations that he is too comfortable associating with anti-Semites. And yet somehow, Jez has displayed a remarkable Teflon quality: the barbs, true as they might be, fail to stick.

Others, including Allister Heath, the editor of the financial daily City AM, have attacked his economic policies, characterizing his Keynesian bent as a throwback to the socialism that bankrupted Britain in the 1970s. This is a vast overstatement. I can hardly imagine a Stalinist making a dedicated website called Corbyn for Business as a campaigning tool. In fact, many of Corbyn’s suggestions have been put forth repeatedly by mainstream economists like Paul Krugman.

Where his critics are correct is that his politics were shaped in a bygone era. Tony Benn, Corbyn’s political godfather, was a giant of socialist thought, and his influence is clear on Corbyn’s line, but as a result, many of the ideas Corbyn is putting forth are political zombies, hanging around because nothing better has emerged to take their place.

It’s been said time and time again that the British working class — the demographic to whom Corbyn and the radical left are appealing — has all but disappeared. The traditional Labour hinterlands in the north of England, conservative in their values, are falling for the lure of the U.K. Independence Party and its xenophobic populism; the urban, progressive but business-savvy Labour inner-city vote can’t exactly be reasoned with in the same way as miners in Wales. In short, Corbyn had been called upon to do too much, too late, with too little, and what’s worse, his tools are blunt, as the Labour Party brand is tainted, considered out of touch and too keen to please Big Business.

Make no mistake: Syriza and Podemos got where they were because they appealed to a young electorate by creating solidarity networks that operate locally, even if they feed into the main party and on many levels outside the political sphere. But can Corbyn find a point of convergence between state-controlled socialism and this new class of precariously employed, overeducated, skeptical young voters?

Corbyn doesn’t seem to support the nonhierarchical, independent-networks-working-together approach these other movements share, and he is in fact a product of the exact opposite mechanism: that of top-down, winner-takes-all parliamentarian politics. So he can inspire, but his clout is limited.

That’s why Corbyn should do his best but aim to groom the next Labour leader for the 2020 elections.

If Corbyn wins, the political classes will throw everything at him, and he should take it and put that Teflon coating to good use. In the meantime, his party should put its energy not into preserving his rule but into training the person who can succeed him — and succeed, period. With the political center shifting leftward, the ground will be ripe for a reinvented Labour Party. The big bet is not to succumb to I-told-you-so critics, as Syriza seems to be doing in Greece, but to frame any failures as mere groundwork for the British left’s eventual rebirth.

A victory for the British left in 2020 isn’t inconceivable, but a 70-year-old Corbyn becoming prime minister in 2020 is hard to imagine. If Jez realizes that he is a key player in a much bigger and longer game, though, he can go down in history as a great politician — and a man who saved his party from irrelevance."

Images of the devastation flit across the screens of the affluent world. For humanitarian aid organizations, these moments are big business. In offices and boardrooms far from the losses, the bounty of disaster relief amassed from well-intentioned donors is divvied up. A June 3 report by ProPublica and National Public Radio examines the gory details of at least one such case. Their investigation exposed how the American Red Cross, which collected billions of dollars in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, built only six houses out of the 130,000 it claimed to have erected. In addition to its refusal to provide an accounting for the $500 million raised as part of the disaster relief, the Red Cross spent far more on overhead costs than previously disclosed, by hiding the operating cost of its subcontractors. The American Red Cross’ deceptions and obfuscations in Haiti are neither accidental nor isolated. The success of transnational aid organizations depends on donors believing that they are an apolitical means of assistance, through which humanity comes to the aid of those afflicted by a disaster with no strategic strings or exploitive paradigms attached. In doing so, however, the world has failed to consider how these organizations are enabling the inequalities of power and privilege to replicate themselves, just as they did in a world divided between colonizer and colonized. While these divisions may no longer be explicit, they lie just beneath the aid-industrial complex’s deft rhetoric of local involvement and communal sustainability.

Reviving colonial stereotypes

The details of how the American Red Cross employees mismanaged disaster relief in Haiti point to how colonial stereotypes of native versus occupier are being relocated into the neocolonial aid machinery. As with the colonists of old, many of the aid workers in Haiti did not speak French or Creole. As a result, they either did not attend community meetings or, when they did, had no idea what was being discussed. In effect, there was often no communication between these workers and the communities they went to assist. Foreign Red Cross workers in Haiti occupied most of the top positions and enjoyed a host of perks. A project-manager position came with relocation expenses, home leave, rest and relaxation breaks, all of which added up to $140,000 a year. When the organization hired locals, they were relegated to lower positions. The highest paid Haitian employee made only $42,000 a year. Hiring Haitians for the lowest spots, however, enabled the Red Cross to claim that 90 percent of its workforce was Haitian. The disdain toward locals was not limited to discriminatory remuneration. It also came in handy when explaining failures, which were inevitably caused by local ineptitude. In the words of one Red Cross employee, the organization’s failure was due in part to “delays in Haitian customs.” Other reasons include the cumbersome Haitian land title system, which caused disputes among the natives.

Humanitarian aid organizations have the capacity to do great work, but they must break through endemic corruption and demeaning stereotypes that see communities as unable to make decisions about their own welfare."

“The situation in Flint is a human tragedy in which families are struggling with even the most basic parts of daily life,” he said in a statement. “While everyone acknowledges that mistakes were made, my duty as attorney general requires that I conduct this investigation.”

Schuette’s announcement came a day after Gov. Rick Snyder asked President Barack Obama to declare a federal emergency in Flint and for disaster relief assistance. Flint has been overwhelmed by a preventable lead-contaminated water crisis.

On Jan. 13, Snyder activated the state’s National Guard to help with his office’s response to the crisis. State health officials are looking to determine if a spike in Legionnaires’ disease cases in the Flint area is linked to the city’s drinking water.

None of these issues came as a surprise for residents of Detroit’s Boynton neighborhood. The 48217 ZIP code is the most polluted in Michigan. The crisis in Flint was compounded after the state’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) repeatedly dismissed complaints from residents about dirty tap water.

As in Flint, the DEQ has dismissed Boynton residents’ complaints about pollution and respiratory issues. Many of them sleep with surgical masks to block toxins from tar sand refining that engulf their homes daily. It is common for Detroiters to wake up with low-grade headaches; many rely on asthma inhalers to quiet persistent hacking coughs that are not from colds.

This is how we live in Boynton in 2016 — coping with irritating sores in the nose, constantly registering complaints to the DEQ about pollution to no avail, sharing dire news with neighbors about newly diagnosed health maladies — such as kidney failure, autoimmune diseases and cancer — and early deaths.

Boynton residents live with fear of early death due to chemical exposure from the nearby massive Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery, which in 2012 underwent a $2.2 billion expansion and processes filthy bitumen and tar sands from Alberta, Canada.

The DEQ ignored numerous complaints about the refinery, saying, it “is in compliance with emission release numbers.” In fact, the agency may soon approve Marathon's request for new permits, which would increase emissions for several air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, small particulate pollution and sulfuric acid mist."

The absence of American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians from conversations about police brutality and social inequality exemplifies the United States’ complicity to the continued marginalization and neglect of Native communities.

Not only do Native Americans need to be included in the debate over police violence against minority populations, but their inclusion must also expand beyond such discussions to other social issues. Native men and women, for instance, are overrepresented in the prison system and as victims of sexual violence. Yet black and Latino males have become the faces of mass incarceration. Native students are suspended and referred to law enforcement and even expelled from schools at disproportionate rates. And Indian reservations have disproportionately high rates of poverty and unemployment.

Most Americans are unaware that a Native Lives Matter campaign even exists. Established in 2014, it speaks to the historical and contemporary oppression of indigenous people in the United States. With the national spotlight on police and criminal justice reform, the Native Lives Matter movement has an opportunity to highlight numerous issues affecting Native Americans.

Even in states with large Native populations, Native Americans suffer the same fate. In Hawaii, for example, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders make up 10 percent of state’s population but are 39 percent of its prison population. Natives make up 38 percent of Alaska’s prison population despite being only 15 percent of the state’s population. Given this dynamic, the current focus on black and Latino males in the debate on criminal justice reform has rendered incarcerated Native men and women insignificant.

The oppression of Native people is not limited to the criminal justice system. Native American women are twice as likely to be victims of sexual assault as women in any other race. On reservations, women are ten times more likely to be murdered than other Americans. Last month, activists raised concerns about the rise in the number of Native women murdered and kidnapped in northern Minnesota. Activists fear that some of these women have been forced into a sex trafficking and allege that the police were being apathetic. These issues did not rise to the level of national crises because many Americans are oblivious to the plight of Native people.

To be clear, the Native Lives Matter movement isn’t simply calling for the inclusion of Natives into the conversation along with blacks and Latinos. The history and legacy of colonialism is critical to understanding issues that still plague Native communities. More than 120 years after U.S. troops overthrew the Kingdom of Hawaii, Hawaiian Natives account for roughly one-third of the state’s homeless population. They still have high poverty rates and are profiled as criminals."

The largely white, upper-middle-class audience laughed. Of course they had.

Marijuana is by far the most ubiquitous illegal drug in the United States: 49 percent of Americans have tried pot at least once, and more than a quarter of Americans under 30 have smoked up in the last month. If the aim of keeping marijuana illegal is to make it unavailable and discourage people from using it, it’s hard to think of a policy that has failed more miserably. Tens of millions Americans, including the last three presidents, have smoked pot, and it is widely and correctly viewed as benign. So it’s not surprising that Cooper got a bit of a chuckle for accusing everyone in the room of committing a crime.

In response, the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, came out against the legalization of marijuana. She made a brazen attempt to have it both ways, calling for “more research” and suggesting that marijuana should remain illegal but that no one should go to prison for it — an endearing paradox reminiscent of Bill Clinton’s 1992 claim that he smoked marijuana but “didn’t inhale.” But evasions aside, she wants to keep weed criminalized. Presidential candidates don’t typically tell an audience that half the people in it should be arrested and given permanent criminal records, yet that’s what happened. So why wasn’t she booed off the stage?

If you’re a white middle-class American, as most of Clinton’s audience was, your odds of facing legal consequences for marijuana possession are vanishingly small. You won’t be caught, you won’t be arrested, and if you are arrested you’ll get a slap on the wrist. The same goes for your children and your friends and your stoner nephew: You’ll all be fine.

That’s why, although a majority of Americans favor legalization (53 percent, including 68 percent of millennials), it hasn’t become a major political issue: White Americans see it as a matter of cultural politics rather than criminal justice policy — a way of signaling what side you’re on in the culture wars rather than a decision about who should be locked up.

That’s dead wrong. According to the ACLU, there were 8.2 million arrests for marijuana in the U.S. from 2001 to 2010 — hundreds of thousands a year, 88 percent of them just for possession. So why don’t most Americans care? How is it possible for a presidential candidate who calls herself progressive to stay on the wrong side of this issue?"

The clip shows him approaching a group of Mizzou students celebrating the firing of Mizzou President Tim Wolfe after an emotionally charged week of protests in which students of color relived their experiences of racial discrimination on campus. After a protest representative asks Tai to leave, he refuses, saying he’s a reporter doing his job. Then the crowd grows more agitated, and he is shoved. Not surprisingly, the media overwhelmingly took the side of the young reporter.

While neither side acted appropriately, it’s clear that both the media and the protesters have a lot to improve on. The protesters shouldn’t have pushed Tai, and he shouldn’t have inserted himself into a group of private citizens when they didn’t consent to have their pictures taken.

In observing the reaction to the fray as an activist with a bachelor’s degree in journalism from Morehead State University in Kentucky, I could take either side. And to everyone who says it’s impossible to be on both, let’s be honest; many journalists have an agenda. Whether it’s Matt Taibbi exposing the greed and corruption of Wall Street, Glenn Greenwald shining a light on the illegality of the modern surveillance state or Rebecca Solnit calling out the recklessness of the fossil fuel industry, we’ve all got our biases, and each of us has built a brand and an audience as a result of that agenda, including me. Protesters at the University of Missouri campus have a right to question the personal agenda of any journalist sticking a camera in their face.

As an activist, I’ve been the subject of many hostile interviews by corporate media reporters sent to protests with the goal of delegitimizing, discrediting and demonizing our cause and our comrades. While supporting a May Day protest in Detroit in 2014, a white reporter with Fox 2 Detroit asked me — a very white person in a crowd of black people — my opinion on Rep. John Conyers’ bill to give reparations to descendants of slaves, phrasing it as “Do you think it’s a good idea to give black people free money?” I explained that, in my opinion, it would be a tremendous boost to the economy and would likely create lots of jobs. Not surprisingly, the station left my interview out of the reporter’s segment.

At the same time, we journalists have not only the constitutional right to do our job but also the duty to report the biggest news of the day to our readers. Our editors have a right to send us to these locations with a microphone and camera handy, and we have the right to ask questions that people may or may not want to answer. One of the most important aspects of a healthy democracy is free media, with journalists able to access public documents, question public officials and document events that have a profound impact on our communities. Our purpose as an institution is to create national conversations about the most controversial issues of the day, which leads to more civic engagement, which creates tremendous value. In that respect, Mizzou protesters’ infringement of Tai’s First Amendment rights hurts us all."

While the recent international climate accords in Paris are an important step forward, the power of wealthy interests in the United States still hampers progress. In her new book, “Dark Money,” journalist Jane Mayer traces how the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and their right-wing allies have funded an elaborate climate change denial operation that has successfully derailed climate legislation.

The denial apparatus

Donors in the Koch network have good reason to oppose climate change, as their business model relies on the market failing to price carbon correctly, due to government subsidies and inaction. As Mayer notes, “Coal, oil, and gas magnates formed the nucleus of the Koch donor network.” Indeed, Koch Industries is one of the country’s largest producers of toxic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. As journalist Tim Dickinson reports, one of the first wins for the Koch brothers was torpedoing President Bill Clinton’s first-term proposal to create an energy tax, which, one high-profile Koch executive said “may have destroyed our business.” Though the Koch brothers claim to love markets, their overriding political goal is to prevent the pricing of externalities. Koch Industries, Mayer reports, increased its lobbying more than 20-fold to $20 million between 2004 and 2008, more than any other energy and gas company. Lee Fang, a journalist at The Intercept, has written about how major donors like the Koch brothers have funneled millions into organizations that deny climate change and actively work to oppose climate legislation. He recently uncovered a massive network of secret political spending aimed at funding climate change denial. A Drexel University study finds that there is an extensive network of organizations funding climate denial, with 140 primarily conservative foundations making donations totaling $558 million to 91 organizations between 2003 and 2010. They find that 5 percent of those donations, or $26.3 million, came from Koch-affiliated organizations. Big fossil fuel companies have spent millions funding climate denial groups, including money to support Willie Soon, a discredited researcher who inflated his credentials and denied climate change (Soon also received money from the Koch Brothers). In 2009, the year the American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES, also called Waxman-Markey after its Democratic co-authors, Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey) was debated, OpenSecrets reported that while pro-environmental groups spent $22.4 million on 489 lobbyists in favor of the bill, the oil and gas industry spent a whopping $175 million and hired 820 lobbyists to defeat it. As University of Massachusetts-Amherst political scientist Brian Schaffner and I have shown, Republican donors overwhelmingly oppose action on climate change, while non-donors on the right are more supportive. But the problem is even deeper. As the chart below demonstrates (using data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study), non-donors (of any party) are more supportive of Waxman-Markey than donors, and big donors (those giving more than $1,000) are the least supportive. Among big GOP donors, only 8 percent were supportive of Waxman-Markey. If politicians responded to voters, rather than donors, there would be more support for pro-climate policies.

In their extensive survey of the opinions of wealthy Americans published in 2013, Benjamin Page, Larry Bartels and Jason Seawright found that climate change ranked dead last among issues threatening the U.S., behind “loss of traditional values,” “trade deficits” and “inflation.” While the wealthy in their study generally favored reducing spending on the environment, the public strongly favored increasing spending. The authors also found that within their sample, the wealthiest respondents were least likely to support regulating the economy. When asked about whether the oil industry needed more regulations, the wealthy were modestly in favor of more regulation (5 points net), while the general public was overwhelmingly favorable of more regulations (50 points net).

Shifting the agenda

One of the most successful campaigns by the big money climate change denialists has been to pressure the GOP into increasingly extreme stances. Mayer writes that, “[President George W.] Bush had vowed during the campaign to act on climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, but once in office [Vice President Dick] Cheney countermanded him.” Instead of reining in greenhouse gas emissions, Cheney pushed for the 2005 energy bill, which included massive subsidies and tax breaks for dirty energy. The Kochs, belying their libertarian views, cashed in huge on the subsidies and lavish government contracts. Bush and Cheney also worked to undermine the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act.

Climate justice is an existential problem for the entire human race. But it’s also yet another example of how the will of the American people is being overridden by a small group of powerful interests.

As recently as 2008, Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain accepted the science behind climate change and pushed for action. Now that his close ally Sen. Lindsey Graham has dropped out of the presidential race after receiving negligible support, it is certain that the eventual GOP nominee will be a climate change denier. One reason for this shift is that the Koch-backed group Americans For Prosperity has encouraged members of Congress to sign a “No Climate Tax Pledge,” committing them to opposing “any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue.” In the 111th Congress (2009-2010), 46 percent of House GOP members and 26 percent of GOP Senators had signed the pledge. By the 113th Congress (2013-2014), a whopping 61 percent of House GOP members and 56 percent of GOP Senators had signed it. But Harvard University political scientists Theda Skocpol and Alexander Hertel-Fernandez have shown that the constituents of these “No Climate Tax” pledge signers aren’t on board with this approach. As they note, 73 percent of the residents of their districts support action to regulate climate change.

GOP legislators who stray from the denialism dogma can find themselves under attack from Koch-backed groups. Consider Graham: When he began working with then-Democratic Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman to co-sponsor a Senate version of ACES, the Koch network immediately went into action. American Solutions, a political group formed by former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich with ties to the coal industry, supported by key donors in the Koch network, attacked Graham for his support of the “gas tax.” Graham soon backed down.

Beyond politics

The actions of donors like the Koch brothers and their vast network go beyond politics. In 2010, David Koch funded an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution that predicted humans would evolve to adapt to climate change. Mayer reports that the Commonwealth Foundation For Public Policy Alternatives, a Pennsylvania think tank funded by secret money but likely tied to conservative publisher and Koch ally Richard Mellon Scaife, who died in 2014, “waged a war” to get a prominent climate scientist fired “and successfully lobbied Republican allies in the legislature to threaten to withhold Penn State’s funding” until they sanctioned the professor. This is just one example of the Koch brothers’ long-held strategy of taking over universities to win the war of ideas. The Kochs and other groups have waged an extensive denial war modeled after the tobacco industry’s earlier campaigns against regulation. The aim is to discredit science. As a leaked memo by conservative pollster Frank Luntz advises, “Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.” The result of the denial war has been that since 1992, gaps on environmental policy between Republicans and Democrats have opened faster than on any other issue. Asked whether they agreed with the statement “There needs to be stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment” in 1992, 93 percent of Democrats and 86 percent of Republicans agreed. In 2012, the percentage for Democrats was unchanged, but only 47 percent of Republicans agreed."

The speech that follows will be an attempt to save Russia’s international credibility that has been nosediving since Russia annexed Crimea and started backing separatists in eastern Ukraine. It is expected to present a Russian-led plan for ending Syria’s civil war, and in return for that solution push for the lifting of international sanctions on Russia.

Putin is making this move now for two reasons: He wants an out from his current entanglement in Ukraine and the Syria crisis is providing an excellent way for Russia to do that.

Putin is an improviser, not a master strategist. After months of walking himself into a corner by doubling down on Russia’s combat and arms support for dependent, but unreliable, separatists in eastern Ukraine, he has finally decided he wants a change. Western sanctions have stung, and together with low oil prices, have sunk the Russian economy into recession while making it harder for giant state-owned corporations, expected to pick up financial slack for the state, to balance their debt. Long term those factors put Putin’s hold over Russia at risk. Syria provides a potential out from the current situation.

Syria has long been fertile ground for Putin’s image abroad. His Sept. 2013 op-ed in the New York Times made President Barack Obama back off on airstrikes in Syria. Prior to the Ukraine-crisis, Putin was even nominated for a Noble Peace Prize for his role in negotiating with Assad. The Syria issue has projected a different Putin than the one the West sees in Ukraine, a Putin who urges caution and tries to moderate the fallout from other countries’ military adventures.

Putin’s speech will come at a time when the Syria issue has never had more importance to the bulk of countries sanctioning Russia. European Union member states have been overwhelmed by the flow of predominantly Syrian refugees. They have no plan for what to do with all of the refugees already in the EU, no plan for how to keep more out, and most definitely no plan for how to end the fighting in Syria. But Putin has a plan and it is already in operation."

Inocente Orlando Montano to Spain, where he faces criminal charges for helping plan the 1989 slayings of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 16-year-old daughter during El Salvador’s civil war.

Twenty-seven years after that brutal massacre, Montano and 16 other high-level Salvadoran military officials may finally face justice for their crimes. An amnesty law passed in the aftermath of the 1992 peace accords that ended the country’s bloody 12-year conflict has shielded the officers from domestic prosecution, through a blanket reprieve that runs afoul of international law.

The suit, filed by the U.S.-based advocacy group Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA) and the Spanish Association for Human Rights, has been winding through the Spanish National Court since 2008. Five of the priests killed were from Spain, providing a nexus to the Spanish courts.

Swank’s ruling is a resounding victory for justice for a conflict in which impunity has reigned. “Holding a senior military officer accountable for the Jesuit massacre is significant on so many levels,” CJA lawyer Almudena Bernabeu said in a statement. “First, we will be able to find the truth that the Jesuits and all Salvadorans have demanded for so long. Truth and accountability will give strength to all those who are trying to end the cycle of violence in El Salvador that has resurged to levels not seen since the civil war.”

Montano, 73, has been in U.S. custody since 2013 on charges of immigration fraud and perjury. The State Department is expected to approve the extradition order. Swank found that he could be considered a terrorist because he collaborated to carry out murders in his official capacity. He was present at key meeting when commanders plotted the murder of Father Ignacio Ellacuría, the University of Central America’s rector, who had been serving as an intermediary in peace talks.

Ellacuría’s death was intended to sabotage peace, but the Jesuit killings horrified the international community, galvanizing pressure to end the conflict. Washington provided more than $4 billion in assistance to the Salvadoran military during the civil war as part of its Cold War strategy, despite its brutal record of human rights abuses.

The Jesuit massacre triggered a congressional investigation led by former Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., whose withering report found that 19 of the 26 Salvadoran officers culpable in in the killings underwent military training at the U.S. Army School of the Americas — including Montano and the elite Atlacatl Brigade, a rapid deployment counterinsurgency unit that was dispatched to silence Ellacuría and any witnesses to his execution. The brigade had already left a trail of blood, including El Mozote massacre in 1981, during which more than 800 people, including 450 children, were killed. The findings coincided with the waning of the region’s strategic importance as the Cold War wound down and prompted Congress to begin withdrawing its support to San Salvador."
None,http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/12/turkeys-long-history-of-attacks-on-the-press.html,Turkey’s Long History of Attacks on the Press,"[u'Rafia Zakaria', u'Kareem Abdul-jabbar', u'James Ryan', u'Arthur Goldhammer', u'Musa Al-gharbi']","[u'turkey', u'erdogan', u'journalists', u'turkeys', u'turkish', u'attacks', u'long', u'erdogans', u'press', u'syria', u'syrian', u'war', u'history']","During World War II, Ismet İnönü’s government closed the top nine Istanbul dailies 44 times for printing articles deemed detrimental to Turkey’s precarious neutrality. Then, just after the war, on Dec. 4, 1945, as Stalin began to pressure Turkey over territory in the east, pro-government student protesters destroyed the offices of three newspapers — the left-leaning daily Tan, the weekly Yeni Dünya and the French-language La Turquie — along with several Russian-owned establishments that, in the view of the demonstrators, espoused a Soviet takeover of Turkey. Editors stood trial for articles they had written that accused the government of setting up clandestine propaganda newspapers and journals in the provinces — charges similar to the ones Dündar and Gül face today.

Clamping down on press freedoms has practically become a tradition during prolonged periods of political upheaval in Turkey. After Mustafa Kemal Ataturk led Turkish forces to victory over European powers and established the Turkish Republic in 1923, he quickly began to tightly manage the press. Cumhuriyet came into existence only with Kemal’s assistance, when two veteran journalists and the director of the Press Ministry were presented with the paper with a gift from Ataturk himself. The paper was often referred to as an official organ, despite its nominally independent status, and after a series of revolts and a tussle with Britain over the Iraqi province of Mosul, Ataturk sentenced many of the paper’s journalists, including Zekeriya Sertel, one of the founders of Cumhuriyet, to hard labor or exile for espousing communist views or for tacitly supporting the ancien regime. Ataturk’s nation may have been founded on many liberal principles — but press freedom was not one of them.

Many news outlets and journalism associations have jumped to criticize Erdogan’s personalization of his rule in Turkey as thin skinned or sensitive to insult. But the two men were not arrested for insulting Erdogan. It’s even more political: They had been reporting for more than a year on the surreptitious convoys to Syria, and Dündar’s coverage has been a consistent thorn in Erdogan’s side since he took over the paper in February. As some critics have suggested , this incident is thus much more closely tied to the overarching political transformation Erdogan is trying to effect in Turkey and in the region at large than it is about his personal paranoia.

As of this writing, Dündar, who received this year’s Press Freedom Award from Reporters Without Borders, is in pretrial detention in Silivri Prison. Similar instances over the period between parliamentary elections on June 7 and Nov. 1 triggered an emergency investigation by the Committee to Protect Journalists, and a separate report, released Dec. 15, found that the number of imprisoned journalists in Turkey “rose dramatically” in 2015.

On Nov. 26, the editor-in-chief and the Ankara bureau head of the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet — Can Dündar and Erdem Gül — were arrested and charged with belonging to a terrorist organization. Their arrests took place after their paper, Turkey’s longest running daily, published footage and articles that suggested that the Turkish security services were sending weapons to Syrian rebel groups — a charge the government denied.

The Democrat Party, elected in 1950, sentenced 79-year old Hüseyin Cahit Yalçın — the elder statesman of Turkish journalism — to 26 months in prison in 1954 for attacking the party in an editorial. It continued with cases opened against 866 more journalists before being deposed in a 1960 coup. Subsequently, Adnan Menderes’ administration raised alarm bells over a series of Soviet-friendly governments in Damascus and Cairo and attempted to use the potential crisis as an opportunity to flex their military muscle in the region. Much of the criticism Menderes drew in this period from journalists regarded the way in which his stance toward Syria and, by extension, the USSR was too aggressive even for Washington, thus endangering the special relationship formed between Turkey and the U.S. by signing onto NATO. Once again, attacks on journalists were viewed as a critical tool for managing the nation’s image at home and abroad.

These are merely a few examples of Turkey’s disregard for the press; one could just as easily go back to the Hamidian period or to the 1980 coup for similar examples. What unites these cases is that the Turkish Republic was in a moment of geopolitical crisis similar to the one it is facing today — often involving its historical rival to the north, Russia.

In this case, the crackdown speaks to how Erdogan — once seen as a major liberalizing force in the region — has, over the years, cultivated populist, majoritarian support to consolidate power and choke opposition. It’s clear that he wishes remake Turkish society in accordance with his conservative Sunni Muslim worldview; in foreign policy, this has translated to a new regional imperialism manifest through aid policies or militarily through a series of operations in Syria and Iraq.

The latest round of attacks on the press is also a reaction to Turkey’s increasingly perilous position regarding Syria. Erdogan’s party has surmounted the most significant democratic challenge by bouncing back in snap elections in November. At the same time, Turkey has suffered a series of attacks sponsored by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), reignited its decades-long war with the Kurdish separatist PKK and, most recently, shot down a Russian fighter jet for briefly entering its airspace. Erdogan has consistently viewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as the greater evil in the Syrian conflict, and Putin’s support of the Syrian regime has caused a perilous devolution in relations.

As troubling as these threats to press freedom are, Turkey is hardly unique in its neighborhood. In 2015, Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey a dismal 149th out of 180 countries, but it did manage to place ahead of Egypt, Azerbaijan, a suite of Gulf states (including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain), war-torn Syria and Iraq. This is a particularly troubling situation because as Syria and Iraq sink further into crisis, governments, civil society organizations and individuals alike increasingly rely on reliable reporting from reporters on the ground in Turkey.

Considering that Erdogan has recently taken unprecedented moves against foreign journalists, the critical job of reporting in dangerous places is becoming only more difficult. What remains to be seen is whether Erdogan’s heavy-handed policies can anchor his personal rule, a la Kemal through the mid-1920s, and evade further entanglement with Russia, as Inönü accomplished in World War II. Perhaps Erdogan’s attempts to meddle in Syria and stand tough against Russia will cause his demise, as Menderes learned in the late 1950s.

Whatever the outcome, the crackdown will exact a steep cost on press freedom in Turkey and make understanding an already confusing Syrian crisis more difficult."
None,http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/9/surveillance-selfies-at-the-stasi-museum.html,Surveillance Selfies at the Stasi Museum,[u'Joshua Kopstein'],"[u'past', u'united', u'east', u'museum', u'stasi', u'selfies', u'states', u'security', u'surveillance', u'war', u'history']","Two of the movement’s most influential activists — Deray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie — were labeled threat actors and assigned a high severity level when they participated in the Freddie Gray protests in Baltimore earlier this year, according to a crisis management report (PDF) prepared by the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance and sabotage under its first director, J. Edgar Hoover — most vividly remembered for the well-documented smear campaigns against civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. — might make one believe that politically repressive surveillance is something confined to a past era. However, recent revelations indicate the U.S. government has been regularly monitoring members of the Black Lives Matter movement since the early days of the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.

In the U.S. this myopic detachment persists even though surveillance remains a daily reality, not just under foreign dictatorships but also in our own backyard.

Being framed against the ephemera of East Germany’s ruthless surveillance machine summoned a recurring thought: Despite the revelations by WikiLeaks and NSA contractor turned whistleblower Edward Snowden, there is still a general belief in the West that oppressive forms of political surveillance belong to another time or place — contained in the snow globe of a turbulent era yet simultaneously quotidian and unremarkable.

The museum was an ideal destination for surveillance sightseeing, in an uncomfortable sort of way. Entering the Stasi’s old stomping ground — specifically the administrative offices and personal quarters of its longest-serving chief and visionary, Erich Mielke — was eerily ordinary, like stepping into a collection of carefully preserved living rooms. The offices are still furnished with modern carpeting and wooden desks adorned with rotary phones, typewriters and ancient switchboards. If not for the surrounding exhibition (which documents the history, victims and methods of the East German state), one might get nostalgic for a dead grandmother’s old parlor. In a reception room near Mielke’s office, a full-body mirror appears to scream for selfies. Naturally, I obliged .

These include landmarks such as Checkpoint Charlie, the famous crossing point between East and West Berlin during the Cold War; Teufelsberg, an abandoned U.S. National Security Agency listening post in the Grunewald forest; and the Stasi Museum in the former headquarters of the infamous East German secret police.

During a recent trip to Germany, I embarked on what I half-jokingly called a surveillance sightseeing tour in Berlin. More than at any other destination, the city’s vast collection of Cold War–related sites and history offers a wide array of surveillance-related attractions.

Germany’s surveillance history is different from the United States’ in many obvious ways. But the Stasi Museum shows there is much to be gained from prominently memorializing Washington’s mistakes.

The outfit maintained continuous monitoring of the protesters’ social media accounts, providing minute-by-minute updates of their movements and briefed classified partners at the NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade. The Department of Homeland Security monitored protests in Washington, D.C., even though a department memo to officials acknowledged it had “no current intel that these marches will be anything but peaceful” and an intelligence bulletin from the FBI noted that there is “no information suggesting violent behavior is planned.”

It demonstrates once again that the purpose of such surveillance has never been protection from vague threats to national security. As with the FBI’s crackdown on civil rights leaders in the 1960s and ’70s and leaders of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the monitoring was intended to intimidate those who dare to organize and galvanize popular opposition by marking them potential terrorists and criminals.

In view of these troubling parallels, the Stasi Museum represents a visceral kind of cultural-historical introspection that is rare in the United States. For example, only one of the 35,000 museums in the U.S., opened in December by a retired lawyer, is wholly dedicated to the foul legacy and history of slavery. Similarly, there is only one museum, which opened in 2013, remembering the brutal internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the 70th anniversary of which was commemorated last month, has no dedicated museum on U.S. soil. American self-reflection on the event is limited to a textbook remembrance of “necessary” acts of war, rather than the unspeakable crimes of mass murder committed by the U.S.

Today’s global surveillance looks nothing like its historical predecessors. But the security apparatus benefits from a similar collective amnesia. In tales of the Stasi, much attention is devoted to the extreme methods used against those deemed deviants and enemies of the state. These include home invasions and wiretaps on those designated subversives as well as the practice of placing sweat rags under interrogation chairs to preserve individuals’ scents in a jar and later give to sniffer dogs.

The focus on the physical manifestations of past surveillance tactics conceals the fact that their core functionalities have not only remained intact but also become optimized and automated. In the post-9/11 era, the Patriot Act and other measures ostensibly aimed at combating the menace of terrorism have reversed most of the legal prohibitions that addressed the past excesses of CoIntelPro, the FBI’s infamous surveillance and intimidation campaign against the civil rights movement and anyone else it considered subversive. As a result, we now live under a ubiquitous and infinitely more complex mass-monitoring regime that makes the arbitrary activation of state tyranny against anyone practically trivial.

Millions of NSA sensors secretly deployed on network switches and undersea cables around the world soak up the metadata and communications of countless individuals — known and unknown. Through the digital residue we produce as a consequence of using communications networks, the Stasi sweat rags have been reproduced at scale and the dogs replaced by cellphone-sniffing algorithms and Predator drones. “We are all living under martial law, as far as our communications are concerned,” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in 2011. “We just can’t see the tanks, but they are there.”

Germany’s surveillance history is different from the United States’ in many obvious ways. But the Stasi Museum shows there is much to be gained from prominently memorializing Washington’s mistakes. Yet remembering history is more than just erecting a museum. It’s also having the vigilance and courage to recognize when past evils creep into the present — even when they manifest slowly and in different forms."

(IFC), which funded the project, seeking remedies for harms to their environment, livelihood and health. The IFC is asking the district court to dismiss the suit, claiming absolute immunity for harms caused by the project, which would leave the plaintiffs without an effective avenue of redress.

“The IFC’s defense boils down to this: ‘We are above the law,’” Rick Herz, the litigation coordinator for the human rights and environmental advocacy group EarthRights International, which represents the Gujarat farmers, said in a statement on July 13. “It argues that it is entitled to act with impunity, contrary to its own mission and accountable to no one, even though the risks were so obvious from the start and the IFC’s failure to act [has been] so devastating for precisely the people the IFC is supposed to help and protect.”

The World Bank’s resistance to accountability undercuts its anti-poverty mission. Its latest insistence on insulating itself from liability follows recent damning revelations about the organization’s failure to protect critics. On June 29 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a leaked World Bank internal survey, which detailed a climate of intimidation at the bank, where nearly 60 percent of staffers said they could not report unethical behavior for fear of repercussions.

On June 22 Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a scathing report that denounced the bank for failing to ensure that critics of bank-funded projects can operate safely. HRW cited numerous examples of repression against human rights defenders, journalists and nongovernmental organizations in Cambodia, India, Uganda, Uzbekistan and other countries.

Speaking out against development projects can be deadly. Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 116 environmental defenders were killed around the world. The bank recognizes the importance of local inclusion to the success and sustainability of its development projects. Yet its policies fail to protect meaningful participation by affected communities. Critics, who often derive little benefit from bank-funded development schemes and may instead suffer grievous harm, have little voice in the projects and few avenues for effective recourse when they are harmed.

Typically, those aggrieved by development megaprojects are poor, marginalized and politically disempowered. That is precisely why they need protected space to organize and speak out against powerful actors that seek to squash their resistance. Last year the bank vowed to “explicitly consider … the voices of the poor.” But its policies fall short of protecting critics of both specific projects and its development policies.

The failure to encourage and protect robust civic participation occurs against the backdrop of bank’s refusal to adopt human rights standards, which undermines its mission and erodes its credibility as an anti-poverty organization. The organization’s aversion to the language of human rights is premised on its founding documents."

As I reported for Al Jazeera America last week, human resources departments routinely stick these clauses into their job postings in ways that are shocking and generally violate the Americans With Disabilities Act. Given that unemployment is one of the most important issues for the disability community, this is a problem. Why does it happen? And what can we do about it? Since publishing my original report, I’ve spoken to legal experts, federal officials, disability rights officials and, most important, disabled job seekers. They have clarified both the depths of the discrimination and the path forward. I also talked to some colleges and universities that I allege are discriminatory in their practices, asking the following questions: Why does the Tarrant County College district director of diversity need to taste or smell? Does a Lehigh Community College sociology professor really need to use hands to handle or feel? Why couldn’t a French professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock be blind? (I know of a blind French professor currently in the field.) Does the dean of fine arts at Eastern New Mexico University really need to lift 25 pounds? Should an accounting professor at Fisk University need to stand, walk or sit? Why does the director of first-year writing at the University of Texas at Arlington need to climb stairs and ladders? Jacenda Davidson, the vice president for human resources at Fisk University, wrote to tell me that staffers in her department “routinely include the essential functions as required qualifications” and that she would be happy to review and identify only “the specific essential functions of the vacant accounting faculty position” — assuming doing so would not fundamentally change the position. She did not answer whether her department would do this for all positions or why it excluded people who couldn’t stand, walk, sit, use their hands, reach with their hands, talk, hear, lift up to 25 pounds or have close, color and peripheral vision. She declined a request for a follow-up. Linda Baker, the executive director of college relations at Lehigh Community College, on the other hand, thanked me for making “a good point about ensuring that job descriptions mirror our openness to hiring people who have disabilities.” She added, “We are considering removing statements about specific physical demands and replacing those with a statement that indicates our willingness to accommodate employees with disabilities.” These points really matter in deterring and discouraging disabled applicants. Over the weekend, I spoke to numerous disabled jobseekers in diverse fields who have long lamented these clauses. A blind woman mentioned how many desk jobs require drivers’ licenses, when what’s really required is that employees show up for work (by whatever means). An academic in the humanities who uses a wheelchair wrote to me: Someone has taken a lot of time to describe the physical, mental and perceptual abilities of a “normal” person. I am disappointed that such normative language made it into these job ads. The academic job market is so trying and exhausting, and for someone with a disability, this sort of language stokes my worst fears, that I would be disqualified from a job because of my disability. It isn’t enough that I prove myself intellectually and professionally. Now I must also do so physically. These individuals wished that I not use their names, citing the fear of bias in their job searches.

Requirement creep, as I’ve been calling this phenomenon, is discriminatory and often illegal.

There are many jobs, of course, for which various abilities are required. A roofer should be able to climb a ladder. An electrical engineer may need color vision and manual dexterity. Nurses and nursing professors may well be required to lift heavy things. Moreover, in all kinds of work situations we are asked to do things not technically in our job description, especially in smaller offices. I am a university professor and a journalist. Per my job description, I teach, write, give talks, serve on committees and otherwise do nonphysical labor. I end up carrying stuff around all the time, and I’m happy to do it, but if I became disabled, I would in no way be less effective at the essential components of my work. Requirement creep, as I’ve been calling this phenomenon, is discriminatory and often illegal. Chris Kuczynski from the legal counsel office at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) expressed surprise at all these physical requirements in nonphysical jobs. He agreed with my conjecture that in most cases this language reflects a boilerplate clause that gets picked up and dropped into every job ad for an organization or company. That’s an explanation but not an excuse. “It’s certainly going to deter people from applying for these positions,” he said. It may be not just boilerplate repetition, though. Karen Nakamura, the Robert and Colleen Haas distinguished chair in disability studies and a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley, suggested that at least some of these clauses are intended to forestall workplace disability lawsuits. If the job description says an employee must lift 25 pounds and then someone throws out his or her back, the clause protects the company from a suit. How do we move forward from here? Kuczynski told me that the EEOC has a new strategic enforcement plan and that these clauses might fall under two of the six priorities: new and emerging issues and barriers to recruitment and hiring. An EEOC commissioner could simply choose to investigate “any kinds of standards that may be screening people out unintentionally or intentionally on a prohibited basis, including disability,” he said. However, the EEOC most often pursues employment discrimination when an employee or applicant contacts the agency. Theoretically, anyone who is disabled and would like to apply for any of these jobs but finds that one of those clauses excludes them by falsely listing a specific physical attribute as essential could go to the EEOC website and file a charge. In the meantime, the disability rights community is ready to start pushing back against these clauses. Lawrence Carter-Long, a public affairs specialist for the National Council on Disability, told me via email that these “thoughtless cut-’n’-paste” clauses discriminate, “without a doubt.” “Thankfully,” he added, “Job providers needn’t wait until they get sued before correcting or, better yet, preventing such mistakes. Clearly, this is now on the radar of the disability community. One thing is certain: In the Internet age, there is nowhere to hide. If employers don’t take the lead in addressing the issue, the disability community certainly will.” Applicants who do not identify as disabled may just skim past these clauses. I had not noticed them before. Disabled applicants, though, skip right down to these clauses when hunting for jobs. For years, perhaps their whole lives, they have dealt with the way society stigmatizes disability, and so they don’t even apply. In fact, various individuals familiar with disability and employment compared the situation to the well-known statistic that women won’t apply for jobs unless they are 100 percent qualified (whereas men apply if they are 60 percent qualified). In fact, it seems that many marginalized groups are generally less likely to apply for jobs unless they meet all the qualifications, including disabled job applicants. It’s likely that many of these companies and universities would be happy to accommodate disabled employees but their hiring processes close that door. These job ads provide the perfect opportunity to follow the maxim “Think globally; act locally.” We’ve got a national problem here in how we hire. Please look in your own communities, schools, organizations and industries. If you can, call them out and ask them to change. If you can’t because it’s not safe for you, let me know, and I’ll get to work."

In August, a union representing the New York Police Department sergeants launched a campaign to shame the homeless. Police officers and the public are being encouraged to submit photos of “homeless people, criminal activity,” among other activities, to a website and Flickr account created for this purpose.

While Pope Francis invites the homeless to dinner, cities across the United States have sought to criminalize their poverty. Since 2011, access to shelters and low-income housing has decreased amid a growing criminalization of homelessness. There has been a 60-percent increase in bans on camping in public; 18 percent of U.S. cities impose city-wide bans on sleeping in public; 27 percent prohibit sleeping in particular public places such as in public parks; 9 percent of cities even forbid feeding the homeless in public. In 2014, 33 U.S. cities increased restrictions or outright banned feeding homeless persons in public.

Unbridled capitalism places profits over people. The accumulation of extreme wealth it funnels into the hands of few elites is built at the expense of the majority. It becomes difficult to create bonds of community and solidarity in an environment of greater the inequality between rich and poor. Those living in poverty become invisible or dismissed as the problem.

However, these rationalizations blind us to the dark side of capitalism in which, in Pope Francis’ own words , “masses of people find themselves excluded and marginalized: without work, without possibilities, without any means of escape.”

U.S. leaders like to trumpet the successes of American capitalism and entrepreneurial spirit. Many commentator s have tried to absolve the U.S. from the Pope’s harsh critiques, suggesting that he doesn’t understand American capitalism or he’s referring to crony capitalism elsewhere.

Pope Francis will arrive in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 22, in his first visit to the United States. There is palpable excitement and anxiety surrounding his trip. The deepest angst is reserved for his appraisal of global capitalism. The Pope has criticized the pervasive and insidious greed of unbridled capitalism and “ the unfettered pursuit of money [as] the dung of the devil .”

Those excluded are no longer society’s underside or its fringes or its disenfranchised — they are no longer even a part of it.

The explicit goal is to shame those living in poverty. It dehumanizes those suffering and treats them as criminals. Last year the New York City Rescue Mission, a charity that provides support and shelter for the homeless, created a video experiment to see if people walking past a homeless person would notice if it was a family member. No one noticed the homeless enough to recognize their own family, underscoring both their invisibility and our culture of indifference.

In one extreme case on Aug. 19, two men in Boston severely assaulted a homeless Hispanic man assuming he was in the country illegally. The assailants claimed that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s immigration policy inspired their attack. The incident made national headlines thanks to the politics involved. Many such attacks go unnoticed everyday. “Exclusion ultimately has to do with what it means to be a part of the society in which we live,” Pope Francis lamented in 2013, “those excluded are no longer society’s underside or its fringes or its disenfranchised — they are no longer even a part of it.”

It is not just the homeless: Working families are also breaking under the weight of American capitalism. Pope Francis has recently criticized market economy for holding families hostage. He is right. The real value of the minimum wage has dropped 40 percent since 1947. Today, the average minimum wage worker is 35 years old, 48 percent are women and 27 percent have children. Long working hours, stagnant wages and economic pressures such as job insecurity and high living expenses are a threat to family life in the United States. Some 25 percent of mothers are forced to return to work only two weeks after giving birth. The United States is the only developed country without any guaranteed paid maternity leave.

Many aspects of the papal visit highlight the absurdity of capitalism’s exploitation. In Philadelphia, prison inmates and guards have hand-carved a chair for the pope’s visit. In New York, immigrant day laborers are building the altar for Madison Square Garden. These are not accidental selections, but mark the deep divide between capitalist societies that its victims among immigrants and prisoners, and the hope they see in Pope Francis’ mission. For Christians, this emphasizes the affinity between victims of today’s capitalist economy and the followers of another poor carpenter and prisoner, Jesus of Nazareth.

The Pope’s visit offers an opportunity to understand and acknowledge capitalism’s effect on the poor. In his speech to Congress and throughout his trip Pope Francis speaks is expected to call on all Americans to reject capitalism’s throwaway culture and build an inclusive culture of solidarity.

The U.S. must recommit itself to social justice by enacting policies and protections for the very poor. This includes permanent housing for the homeless, improved social safety net and expansion of low-income housing programs. Americans must also commit themselves to compassion, by treating the homeless with kindness and dignity.

Pope Francis is calling for a radical cultural conversion that places people and the Earth before profits. Guaranteed paid maternity leave would be one clear and easy place to start. Similarly, fast food workers around the country, who are demanding a livable wage, deserve greater protections. If the low cost of a hamburger and fries is more important than the person serving them, that is the throwaway culture of indifference. Pope Francis is calling on us to reject such practices in our personal lives and as a political community."
None,http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/1/oscar-voters-need-to-take-responsibility.html,Oscar Voters Need to Take Responsibility,"[u'How To Solve The Skills Gap', u'Hooray For Cultural Marxism', u'Rafia Zakaria', u'Purge The New York Times Op-ed Page', u'Malcolm Harris', u'Musa Al-gharbi', u'Kareem Abdul-jabbar', u'Arthur Goldhammer']","[u'studios', u'oscars', u'voters', u'oscar', u'nonwhite', u'movies', u'responsibility', u'stars', u'academy', u'need', u'white', u'action', u'market']","Once again, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has let America down. The Oscars are meant to represent the highest honor in filmmaking, and yet — with the exception of last year’s best director Alejandro González Iñárritu — the nominees in the major categories are uniformly white. The ballot has engendered boycott threats, boosted last year’s hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, and unloaded a truckload of industry excuses. But unless only white people made great movies last year, the academy is failing to live up to its mandate and recognize excellence.

Some commentators have stuck to a variant of the first idea: that Hollywood doesn’t make enough serious movies by and about nonwhite people. “There were an incredible number of films in 2015 that were primarily about white people. Talk to the studios about changing that, not the academy,” actress and academy member Penelope Ann Miller told The Hollywood Reporter. “There’s only so much we can do.” This argument has the virtue of being based on an undeniable fact: The voters are drawing from a rigged deck. The movies with nonwhite stars that were supposed to compete this year (“Concussion,” “Straight Outta Compton”) simply didn’t make it that far in the process, and the larger lack of diversity means there isn’t a glut of potential nominees to take their place. The Oscars, the argument goes, are the symptom, not the cause.

But that’s not exactly true. Kevin Hart is the most bankable comedy star working. There’s a market for Will Smith, Denzel Washington and Vin Diesel as action stars. And Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson can draw the crowds doing both these things. Sure, a handful of male nonwhite genre stars don’t redeem the industry, but they show there is a demand and an audience for them out there. The Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice awardees are considerably more diverse than the Oscars — Smith holds the career record with 10 — in no small part because the kids recognize action stars in their own category.

Perhaps we should think of the Oscars less as an award ceremony and more as a market for movies, complete with its own subgenre designation: Oscar bait. Last year, UCLA sociologists Gabriel Rossman and Oliver Schilke published a paper in The American Sociological Review that tried to quantify the Oscar-seeking market by looking at the way filmmakers from 1985 to 2009 incorporated the themes, genres, staff and other qualities of recent winners. They found that the market functions like a Tullock lottery — a kind of auction in which winning and losing bidders both pay at the end. According to their model, the studios are playing the optimal strategy: Films bait the Oscar voters; the ones that win nominations make money; the ones that don’t lose money; taken together, movies in this subgenre are as successful as movies outside it. The studios crowd one another for nominations until the expected rate of return on Spielberg’s latest matches a dumb comedy or an action flick."

This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will see fewer than 6,900 white-collar prosecutions, down from nearly 11,000 in 1995, the TRAC report shows.

The reduction in prosecutions for white-collar crimes was revealed in Department of Justice data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University.

The decline grows from our corrupt campaign finance system, which by its nature shifts the focus of elected leaders away from crimes in the C-suites to harsh enforcement of laws on the streets.

This year the number of federal white-collar crime prosecutions will be about 37 percent below 20 years ago, when Bill Clinton was in the White House.

Congress is starving federal white-collar law enforcement — a subtle and lucrative favor to the crooks and connivers among the political donor class. The move is costing honest people everywhere, damaging economic growth and perverting government.

No group of thieves benefits more from this trend than the bankers who sold mortgages they knew would never be repaid and then bundled them into packages of securities that were often bought by public employee pension funds.

This shift from already modest enforcement of federal fraud laws has received almost no news coverage — part of another related trend. As newsroom budgets shrink, we get more coverage of controversies and folderol and less scrutiny of government. The heavy lifting on serious news in America comes mostly from five major newspapers, all of which ignored the TRAC findings: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.

I reanalyzed the TRAC report to take into account population growth and found a nearly 50 percent decline in the prosecution rate, from 1 for every 24,400 Americans in 1995 to about 1 in 46,600 this year.

We’ve just seen a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors, who want and expect and sometimes get favors for themselves after the election’s over.

Insiders knew about these crimes — from compliance officers who were ignored to paper processors to honest real estate appraisers — as thoroughly documented by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in a report Congress paid for and then tossed aside.

Had the Obama Justice Department wanted to prosecute bankers, it would have been easy, according to William K. Black, a former banking regulator whose diligence in the savings and loan scandal a generation ago resulted in more than 3,000 felony convictions and more than 800 high-level bankers going to prison.

All prosecutors need are emails, memos and testimony instructing subordinates how to cheat, falsified banking records (which exist in abundance) and the transfer of funds by wire or sending documents by mail. Yet from Obama to Benjamin Wagner, the chief federal prosecutor in Sacramento, California, officials said they could see only bad choices, not crimes.

The White House, the Justice Department and members of Congress would not respond to Black’s calls and emails offering his help. They did not return my calls either, when I asked about their lack of interest. This should not be surprising to those who have followed the ongoing institutional corruption of our politics. By making massive campaign contributions, the donor class funds who wins elections and, as a result, purchases influence over our representatives. Predictably, politicians then look the other way at minor indiscretions, errors in judgment and outright frauds.

Consider what former President Jimmy Carter said on a radio show the other day about the effect of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which removed nearly all limits on campaign donations. Carter, advancing an argument I have made for several years, said of our democracy:

Now it’s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president. And the same thing applies to governors and U.S. senators and Congress members. So now we’ve just seen a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors, who want and expect and sometimes get favors for themselves after the election’s over.

Congress has cut the capacity of more than just the Justice Department to enforce the law against those among the oligarchs who engage in frauds. Our lawmakers have also slashed the budget of the Internal Revenue Service and other federal law enforcement agencies.

This fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, Congress gave the IRS $33.90 per American to administer and enforce the tax laws — down from $44.54 in 1995. What that means is wages, pensions and other verified income get thoroughly taxed through a mostly automated system while the largely unverified income of the donor class gets audited rarely and only lightly.

This lack of resources is so severe that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants passed a resolution in May asking Congress to appropriate enough money so that the tax police can ‘‘enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all.’’

Would that we had a lobby to promote all aspects of white-collar law enforcement. But I can’t figure out how vigorously pursuing frauds would be profitable for any major industry. On the contrary, lack of enforcement has been enormously profitable for many in the donor class. For the crooks among those at the top, that’s paradise. The rest of us who don’t have money to donate get a government that doesn’t pay attention to our concerns and needs."

Those pitched on the sweet fruit’s miraculous properties didn’t know the project was actually created for the United Fruit Co., the largest trader of bananas in the world.

The creation of front groups — independent-sounding but industry-backed organizations — as a public relations strategy dates at least as far back as Bernays’ day. But a new report by Kari Hamerschlag, a senior program manager at the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth; Stacy Malkan, a co-founder of the food industry watchdog U.S. Right to Know; and me shows that such tactics are continuing with ever more scope and scale today.

The report, released today, exposes the growth of food-industry-sponsored front groups and other covert communication tactics in the past few years. While food industry spin is not new, we’re seeing an unprecedented level of spending and deployment of an ever wider array of PR tactics. We argue this rise of industrial food spin is a direct response to mounting public concerns about industrial agriculture as well as a growing interest in sustainable food and groundswell for organic products.

Increasingly, the American public is raising questions about toxic chemicals used in farming, routine antibiotics used in livestock production and genetic engineering in agriculture. The booming organic food business is one sign: Sales of organic food and products in the United States are projected to jump from $35 billion in 2013 to $170 billion in 2025 — a direct threat to the profits of the processed food, animal agriculture and chemical industries engaging in such spin. According to a recent Fortune article, since 2009 the 25 biggest food and beverage companies — selling nonorganic processed and junk food — lost an equivalent of $18 billion in market share. “I would think of them like melting icebergs,” the article quotes Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow as saying. “Every year they become a little less relevant.”

In the face of this threat, we argue that the industrial food sector — from the biotech behemoths to the animal agriculture industry — is working overtime to defuse these concerns with well-funded communication efforts and a rash of new front groups. From 2009 to 2013, just 14 of these front groups spent $126 million to shape the story of food while presenting the veneer of independence. There’s the Alliance to Feed the Future, which produces Common Core–vetted curricula on healthy food for public schools. Its members include the Frozen Pizza Institute and the Calorie Control Council, which promotes the benefits of Olestra and saccharin, among other artificial sweeteners and fats. You don’t need to be an expert in food security to be skeptical to take advice about feeding the world from the trade council for fake sugar and fat."

There President Vladimir Putin convened back-to-back meetings of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit on July 8 and of the Shanghai Cooperation Council, (Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) on July 9. Putin and China President Xi Jinping dominated the announcements of plans for what looks to be a comprehensive blending of interests and resources of all the states for the balance of the century. In a video released to the media, Putin and Xi sat directly across from each other in a vivid demonstration of plain-spoken, all-business authority, as Putin welcomed Xi to “one of the most beautiful parts of our country,” and Xi called Putin “my old friend.” The result was a demonstration of the potential for British geographer Halfor Mackinder’s century-old theory that Europe and Asia form a supercontinent, with Russia as the central nation, the “Heartland,” of Eurasia. To translate this to present geopolitical terms, Russia and China look to be constructing a grand alliance of Eurasian powers that could counterbalance the U.S. and its Western allies. The Ufa confabs were starkly absent of any representatives from the West. And rather than Russia being isolated by the U.S.-directed sanctions because of the Ukraine crisis, it was the US and its NATO allies who were notably absent from the discussions.

BRICS

The five-year old BRICS association, with 40 percent of humanity and 20 percent of world GDP, made several announcements looking to bolster membership, enhance growth and most importantly to create an alliance that is independent from American-influenced institutions The New Development Bank, signed into life last year in Brazil, will consider new infrastructure projects by year’s end with what is promised to be “simple, clear and transparent” procedures. Also announced was a $100 billion currency pool to provide security from currency shocks. This pool is understood to supplement, if not compete, with the International Monetary Fund established at the end of World War II. The BRICS association soon aims to make it possible for mutual settlements between members to be in local currencies, not depending on the U.S. dollar. These steps by Beijing and Moscow seek to construct a basis for financial independence from the West by 2030. Russia and China have spoken in the past of a world currency other than the US dollar. Now the old friends want to go much further. In a surprise Russian television broadcast on Friday, July 3, a week before the Ufa meetings, the expanded Russian national security council appeared alongside Putin in order to lay out a vision for the decades ahead. Because of Western sanctions combined with the sharply reduced price of oil, Russia is suffering a severe recession right now that will deepen later this year. However, the television presentation was about the Kremlin’s ambition to be financially and economically independent of America and even Europe by 2030.

There is nothing to be gained by Washington pretending it can continue to project military and economic power into an ambitious Eurasia.

Shanghai Cooperation Org

The second day of the Ufa meetings was for the 15-year-old Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and its big dreams for Eurasia. Russia and China indicated they are looking to combine Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union with China’s massive infrastructure plans — the Silk Road Economic Belt. The combination would fall under the umbrella of the extant SCO. The advantage to Russia would be access to capital now unavailable because of Western sanctions. The advantage to China would be that it only has to cross “one unified tariff zone” to reach the rich West. Also, the SCO announced that observer states India and Pakistan will soon join as full members. Other Asian states are also lining up to join the SCO. Iran, Mongolia, and Afghanistan have observer status. Russia said it will invite Iran to join SCO fully as soon as possible, pending the success of the proliferation talks. Also, Putin said that “Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cambodia and Nepal are joining the SCO as dialogue partners.” The SCO also said it was working to establish a Development Bank and Development Fund. Russia has already joined with dozens of other nation in the “Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.” Chinese dreams for Eurasia are breathtaking in scale, reminiscent of a Jules Verne adventure. There is a proposal to construct an 8,000-mile underground railroad from China through Siberia and across the Bering Sea to Alaska and Canada. There is another proposal to tunnel under Mt. Everest. Of note, the SCO showed solidarity with Moscow on the Ukraine crisis. It issued a closing document that called for a peace following the Minsk 2 accords of last February. Also of note, Russia expressed solidarity with China in its present dispute with Japan and its neighbors in the South China Sea. Putin accepted Xi’s invitation to attend the September celebration of what is billed as China’s victory over Japan but what is understood by Japan to be a Chinese chauvinist provocation in the region. The Chinese Communist Party had nothing to do with the defeat of Imperial Japan in 1945 by Chiang Kai-Shek’s National government.

Last week his five-year ordeal in and out of New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex ended in suicide. Paradoxically, that made him part of a less familiar statistic: the number of black youths who take their lives every year. Both numbers speak to the multiple effects of systemic oppression on young minds.

Suicide in Browder’s demographic is more common than is often assumed. New research shows a recent rise in suicide among black children, even as suicide rates fell among other groups. Suspected risk factors include exposure to trauma and violence, a paucity of family connections and social supports in their communities and — in a sad twist on a headline we hear too much in the news — easy access to guns.

Suicide risk is elevated among people held in isolation (PDF), including many youths. Browder, who was accused of stealing a backpack and kept behind bars without ever going to trial, spent many months in solitary confinement. He joined scores of other youths who, without access to bail or decent legal assistance, are banished from human contact in conditions tantamount to torture, supposedly to maintain security.

Under public pressure, New York City officials recently announced plans to phase out solitary for younger inmates, starting with 16- and 17-year-olds and moving on to 18-to-21-year-olds by 2016. (Currently Rikers keeps in solitary about 100 people ages 19 to 21.) Though those reforms are a step forward, they won’t fix the problems that have long plagued the facility, including a lack of basic mental health services and other rehabilitative programs for young people. And they do nothing for the kids who, like Browder, have already returned to their communities, but remain deeply scarred and struggling to restore their lives.

While Browder almost beat the odds — he eventually fought his way out of Rikers, vindicated after a three-year court battle — the trauma resurfaced afterward in his emotional volatility and constant flashbacks. While we can only speculate on what ultimately triggered his suicide, we know that he was overwhelmed by the haunting memories of ferocious beatings and ritual humiliation by jail officers.

“Everything was just getting to me,” he recalled while discussing a past suicide attempt in an interview with Huffington Post Live in 2013. (He tried to hang himself on several occasions, in and outside jail.) “And I just couldn’t take it. But the correction officers, they didn’t want to hear me out. Nobody wanted to listen.” According to his family, days before his death, he faced the threat of more incarceration after another run-in with the cops.

Though it gets comparatively less attention than sensational gang shootings or drug crime, suicide remains a leading cause of death among young black men (PDF)."

The index rose by one-fifth of 1 percent — the smallest increase since the data series was launched in 1982. Without real growth in wages the economy cannot grow because the capacity of people to buy goods and services — what economists call aggregate demand — will remain flat. This is a problem that we can fix, and there are three obvious ways to address it. But it requires the involvement of government, which makes the rules governing the market. If there is one thing that centuries of experience have taught, it is this: Whatever the rules, businesses adapt.

Flat wages

The median wage — half make more, half less — has been stuck since 1998 at a bit more than $500 a week. In 2013 average pay declined from the previous year in 59 of the 60 salary levels the government tracks. Only jobs paying $50 million or more had higher average pay. Wages and salaries account for about 70 percent of total income, IRS data show. Total income — which includes proprietor profits, capital gains and other non-wage income — is growing only at the top. Just 1,361 households captured 8 percent of all the real increased income between 2008 and 2012, my analysis of IRS data shows. The rest of the top one percent, or 1.36 million households, got 43 percent of all the gains. Flat wages demonstrate that America no longer has a labor market, at least not as defined by the United States Supreme Court. The high court has held that a market requires a buyer (employer) and seller (worker) acting without coercion and a reasonable command of the facts reaching an agreement on price (pay). But instead of negotiating compensation, employers act like car rental companies: Employers set a price for labor, and workers can take it or leave it, often with no negotiating. Lawyers call these contracts of adhesion. They make for efficient commerce for transactions such as car rentals, but have no place in employment if you believe in competitive markets.

Minimum wage

One smart solution would be to slowly but steadily raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which $31,200 a year for someone who works full-time with no vacation. That idea has caught on the local and state levels, but not in Congress. Because of the upward pressure it would put on jobs paying up to about $20 an hour, about 70 percent of workers would benefit. Adjusted for inflation, the current $7.25 per hour federal minimum wage is about two thirds of what the wage was in the mid-1960s. America is a much wealthier nation today and yet we allowed the minimum wage to fall in real terms. Raising the minimum wage will reduce taxpayer costs for food stamps, cash assistance, medical care subsidies and a host of other government programs. These are really hidden subsidies for employers because they help them hold down wages. Opponents argue that raising the minimum wage is a giveaway program for teenagers. Yet more than three out of four minimum-wage workers are 20 years or older.

For the economy to grow and people’s lives to improve, we need Congressional action.

The federal minimum does not cover millions of workers, including tipped restaurant employees whose base wage is permanently fixed at $2.13 an hour under a law signed by President Bill Clinton at the behest of the National Restaurant Association. Congress first enacted the $2.13 base wage in 1991, making the minimum today in real terms worth just $1.22 per hour. A higher minimum wage does not cost jobs, as opponents of the law argue. A number of studies, including one that looked at counties that border each other across state lines with differing minimum wage levels, shows slight positive effects and almost no evidence of a negative effect on jobs. In the long run, a higher minimum wage will encourage greater investment in equipment to replace labor, but that may not reduce employment if aggregate demand grows and creates other jobs. Setting a minimum threshold for pay is as appropriate a government action to promote the general welfare, as called for in the preamble to our Constitution, as airline safety and regulations governing company stocks.

The attack left 58 people dead and many more wounded.

Nine months after Nigeria’s newly elected President Muhammadu Buhari vowed to squash the insurgency, Boko Haram’s threat still looms large. Buhari clinched a historic victory in March 2015 elections in large part because of his reputation as an incorruptible leader. His campaign emphasized Buhari’s experience as a general and former military leader as key to defeating Boko Haram and restoring law and order to Nigeria’s war-torn northeast.

As per his campaign pledge, shortly after taking office, Buhari moved the military command center in charge of the operation against Boko Haram to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State and epicenter of the insurgency. The swift change signaled that the era of languid military operations against the insurgency had come to an end.

But the fight against Boko Haram has stalled since that initial push to dislodge the insurgents from the territory they captured in 2015. Buhari’s administration has claimed that the group is “technically defeated,” but Boko Haram’s recent deadly attacks on markets and villages suggest otherwise. The Buhari administration has routinely underestimated the threat posed by the insurgents while overestimating the effectiveness of the Nigerian military’s counterinsurgency campaign. Buhari must engage in military action and reform — not just rhetoric — to get the job done.

The territorial gains against the insurgency are encouraging, but Buhari’s government has yet to seriously degrade the group’s capabilities. Boko Haram’s ability to overrun vast territories remains intact. As the dry season, which is typically favorable for ground offensives, draws closer, observers are wondering, ‘What is Buhari waiting for?’

Buhari has failed to shift into a total war mode because of a narrow, poorly fitted definition of what victory against Boko Haram looks like and a misplaced trust in the executive leadership for guidance in the fight against the insurgency. In an interview with the BBC last December, Buhari insisted that the insurgency was no longer capable of mounting ‘conventional attacks’ against the state and local communities. This sort of analysis overlooks Boko Haram’s modus operandi and ability to engage in ambush hit-and-run attacks.

Structural issues within the security sector, including a culture of impunity, an unprofessional military and a corrupt bureaucracy, have further complicated efforts to establish lasting stability. Instead of celebrating half-victories, Buhari’s government should redouble its military efforts and prepare the Nigerian public for a long, difficult fight and by engaging in a robust planning for a post-conflict rehabilitation.

Some displaced residents have returned to their villages and towns amid notable improvements in security. Urban centers boast increased military presence. Businesses and schools have resumed in cities such as Maiduguri. However, despite these improvements, Buhari’s campaign against Boko Haram — Operation Zaman Lafiya — has lacked serious follow through. Rural areas across the North East remain contested. Boko Haram’s raids in Dalori on Feb. 1, in which 65-100 residents were killed and the entire village was burned to the ground, illustrates the fact that the Nigerian military has not fully reclaimed all territories. In fact, the military has not led robust operations in Boko Haram’s strongholds — most notably the Sambisa Forest, where a number of insurgent cells that were forced out of urban centers and rural holding have been regrouping for months."

Bush and Barack Obama to interpret their counterterrorism mandate broadly, to include targets ranging from the Taliban to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Boko Haram and other Al-Qaeda affiliates around the world. The U.S. drone program, which aims to eliminate high-value targets from these organizations and disrupt imminent terrorist plots against the United States, has been a key component of their efforts. However, critics have questioned the program’s effectiveness for some time. For example, U.S. officials didn’t always know whom they were killing or what group the targets belong to — let alone whether or not they committed any grievous crime or posed a meaningful threat to U.S. personnel or interests. Moreover, those killed in the drone strikes were generally not high-value targets, but low-level militants, a term denoting any military-aged male killed in the campaign. A cache of leaked military documents released last week by The Intercept confirms these shortcomings. But perhaps more important, the documents reveal not only that the drone program is ill-suited to achieve its purported goal, but that it is actually counterproductive in many respects.

Undue popularity

Until now, the U.S. drone program has enjoyed overwhelming support from lawmakers and the American public as a way of achieving critical U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives with minimal costs, commitments or complications, notably without putting American boots on the ground. However, Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIL have all actually been gaining in strength despite unrelenting U.S. strikes due in large part to popular outrage at collateral damage of the strikes and the erosion of governance in the areas most affected. Nonetheless, U.S. policymakers continue to insist that it is possible to remotely contain, degrade and eventually destroy these groups by properly tweaking existing policies. The Pentagon’s own assessment, detailed in The Intercept’s report, casts doubts on this prospect. The program is inefficient and often misses intended targets, because of a lack of on-site special operations and intelligence support in countries of operation. Drones are best used as a compliment — not a substitute — for boots on the ground. To deprive aerial campaigns of ground support is to condemn them to failure.

Costs of misuse

Warfare is increasingly asymmetrical, fluid and urban. It is no longer feasible to achieve victory by simply bombing enemy formations and other “hard targets.” Identifying critical assets, or even distinguishing combatants from non-combatants, have become complex and fraught. Effective air campaigns require tactical air control party teams on the ground to help identify targets. Without these assets, the U.S. government is forced to rely extensively on signals intelligence — a typically uncorroborated metadata from phones and email accounts — to identify and track their targets. There are myriad problems with this approach. First, phones and email accounts often have several possible or actual users that shift over time. Moreover, if the target believes they are being monitored, as terrorists usually do, it is easy to obscure information, or even feed misinformation to those eavesdropping. Since this method is so unreliable, potential leads should always be corroborated by other, more trusted means. In this regard, there are few alternatives to deploying intelligence agents to the field.

Overreliance on unmanned systems pushes the government toward military overreach by creating the impression of a ‘clean war.’

Due to limitations in the size of the drone fleet and its capabilities, remote surveillance cannot serve as an adequate substitute. And it would be fruitless to upgrade the fleet because there is also a critical shortage of drone operators; their numbers are insufficient to manage even the existing sorties. Additionally, thousands of analysts would be required to process the deluge of content produced by any expansion and to translate it into actionable intelligence. And then scores of new aides would have to read the resultant reports and advise commanders or policymakers accordingly. The logistics and cost of recruiting, clearing, training and coordinating all of these, especially in an era of budget sequestration, would be prohibitive. It is also difficult to employ foreign intelligence services in the countries of operation because their methods are often inconsistent with U.S. standards and interests. In some instances host governments have portrayed domestic dissidents and political rivals as terrorists, using U.S. counter-terrorism campaigns to consolidate their power. In many cases, there are even direct lines of communication between local authorities and the militants being targeted, meaning closer cooperation could jeopardize, rather than enhance, U.S. operations. There are also opportunity costs of overreliance on unmanned systems. It is impossible to capture and interrogate enemies with drones. Nor can drones effectively seize a target’s laptops, cell phones or documents. As a result, even when strikes do kill the intended target, precious intelligence dies with them. In other words, every single sortie destroys troves of actionable intelligence — eroding, rather than augmenting, our understanding of the organizations being targeted.

The Taliban now controls about 30 percent of Afghanistan — more than it controlled at any other time since 2001. Public confidence in the Afghan national unity government is waning because of continued attacks in Kabul and the threat of violence from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The economy is in free fall. The partial withdrawal of foreign military infrastructure means that hundreds of thousands of people are now unemployed or soon will be. Corruption among government leaders remains rampant.

In Kabul people don’t need a 230-page report to understand the deteriorating security situation. On Feb. 1 a Taliban suicide bomber killed at least 20 police officers in an attack near a police complex, wounding 29 others. It was the latest in a series of assaults in the Afghan capital this year and yet more proof that the U.S.-led “war on terrorism” is not working.

A more effective way to combat violent extremism is to offer something in its place, and I don’t mean weapons. Every time a suicide bomber detonates his charge in Kabul, I am reminded that Afghanistan must do a better job on the battlefield of ideas. That is the only war in which we stand a chance of winning.

Young people in Afghanistan are looking for opportunities, hope and inspiration. And if they can’t find those things, they will leave. They are already fleeing the country in unprecedented numbers. “Afghans accounted for 20 percent of the million-plus migrants to the European Union in 2015, second only to Syrians fleeing their own civil war,” the SIGAR report said. Afghanistan issued more than 2,000 passports a day in Kabul last year, a sixfold increase over 2014, mostly to men and women under the age of 30, according to SIGAR. And last fall Afghanistan’s Refugees and Repatriations Ministry launched a social media campaign in an effort to stop the exodus of young people.

“Don’t go,” the ads implored. “Stay with me. There might be no return!”

But many Afghans would rather take their chances in another country than stay in or return to their homeland, where the odds are stacked against them. If 14 years of foreign intervention and billions of dollars in international aid have taught us anything, it is that answers to Afghanistan’s problems are not going to come from abroad. If we are to build a lasting and sustainable democracy, we will have to do it ourselves.

Afghanistan is on the brink. In some ways, the country has made great progress. Under Taliban rule, it had almost no independent media, and women were confined to their homes, deprived of the right to go to school, work or move about without a male companion. Today 28 percent of the Afghan parliament is made up of women. There are four female ministers in the unity government. And robust and diverse media are striving to hold leaders accountable."

In Tampa, I led an independent research project on the effects of HOPE VI from 2000-09. We interviewed relocated households and homeowners in two receiving neighborhoods, and tracked socioeconomic conditions in all relocation sites in the county.

If concentration is the problem, then the solution should lie in de-concentration: Just move people into more wholesome environments and let them thrive. Actually, we already tried that. For nearly two decades, from 1992 until 2010, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) demolished hundreds of public housing complexes under the HOPE VI program, allegedly to rescue residents from the effects of concentration. Most families were relocated into private housing using vouchers. During that same period (1994-98), a HUD experiment called Moving to Opportunity (MTO) was launched in five U.S. cities, and randomly selected public-housing families were deliberately relocated into census tracts in which poverty-level households constituted less than 10 percent.

Data from concentrated neighborhoods do reflect worries for youth growing up there. Correlations between high poverty rates and adverse medical, domestic, educational, employment and criminal justice outcomes seemingly confirm that these places are toxic. Jargowsky and other analysts imply that these problems are greatly aggravated by residents’ collectively inappropriate values, behavior and choices.

Jargowsky issued a much cheerier report (PDF) on the same subject in 2003, based on observed changes through the 1990s, when the number of high-poverty tracts actually declined slightly instead of increasing. Since then, however, we appear to have headed in the other direction. Much of this has been driven by the national economy, which tanked in 2008. Poverty rates spiked and have stayed high. Growing concentrations of poverty are consistent with rising rents and widespread refusal of landlords to accept housing vouchers.

Such arguments fail to consider that the only neighborhoods poor people can afford overwhelmingly have underfunded schools, overly aggressive police, substandard housing, inadequate health care, exploitative businesses, paternalistic or corrupt services, few legal job possibilities and too much crime. Correlation is not causation. Distressed conditions in these neighborhoods were not caused by an absence of “role models” or inadequate social capital. In fact, there is far more social capital in high poverty neighborhoods than Jargowsky and others have assessed. But that reality is ignored in this latest round of warnings about the growing dangers of concentrated poverty.

Jargowsky’s thesis, embraced by many other urban analysts, is that large numbers of poor people living together in distressed surroundings will generate a local culture that lacks social capital and adequate “role models” and reinforces negative behavior . Inappropriate lessons learned on the streets of poor, segregated neighborhoods are viewed as a major cause of individual failure.

Residential clustering of very poor families, especially of ethnic minorities, is increasing. Widely reported analyses by Paul Jargowsky, a fellow at the Century Foundation and professor of public policy at Rutgers University, show a growing number of neighborhoods in which poor households exceed 40 percent — the threshold measure of a demographic condition called “concentration.” He associates concentrated poverty with riotous protest and police violence, along with high rates of school dropouts, teen pregnancy and incarceration. Concentrated poverty apparently brews a toxic mix of lawlessness and despair that is contagious, lethal and growing.

Relocation is not the answer to poverty or its concentration. We cannot abandon or demolish whole neighborhoods because too many poor people live there.

Nationally, formal evaluations of both HOPE VI and MTO showed no measurable improvements in the economic wellbeing of relocated adults or educational success of children. Few benefits were found for either program, and there were several negative outcomes. Boys faced particular problems in new neighborhoods. Recent research (PDF) with young male adults who grew up in MTO low-poverty neighborhoods revealed significantly higher levels of conduct disorder and PTSD than counterparts who stayed behind in public housing. Another, more positive study of the MTO data suggests that children in families who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods before age 13 now earn more on average as adults, and are more likely to be married. However, those who moved when they were older have fared worse than those who grew up in public housing. Although results are mixed, the most that can be said is that relocating families with young children, preferably only girls, might yield benefits in the next generation.

Many relocated families have returned to old neighborhoods, to reconnect with kin and friends, regain access to transit, and/or escape unpleasant conditions. Relations with new neighbors had been one source of unpleasantness. Relocated families we interviewed in a low-poverty Tampa neighborhood reported both social and physical isolation, as well as overt hostility from their new neighbors. Housing was better, but transit and other services were worse. Many of their old ties were severed, and new social connections intended to open opportunities and mentor youth weren't forming. Interviews with a large sample of surrounding homeowners confirmed the reported hostility: They worried about property values and safety, and were angry at the government for endangering them with “these families.”

That fearful hostility, infected with racism and fed by real economic concerns, reflects the ugly history of racially concentrated poverty and resistance to desegregation. Well into the second half of the 20th century technocrats confidently advised builders, bankers and public officials to avoid residential mixing of races. The templates of cities, suburbs and transit followed that rule, as did realtors, insurers and lenders. Too many still quietly accept it. Jargowsky concedes all this, but he leaves unquestioned the ongoing folklore about cultures of poverty and the dangerousness of poor people of color.

The same scurrilous racial stereotypes that originally justified segregation (i.e, “concentration”) were invoked as reason to remove people from places where they may have wanted to stay and scatter them into other neighborhoods where it was believed they could learn better ways to live.

Under the HOPE VI plan, containment changed to coerced dispersal. The logic had not changed — just the tactic. Relocation was justified by claims that public housing fostered a pathological social environment, an argument that validated negative images of public-housing tenants and fueled hostile reactions in receiving neighborhoods. MTO was nearly shut down in Baltimore due to resistance in white neighborhoods. These deeply rooted beliefs are the real problem — and policies that are effectively based on them are both wrong and counter-productive.

Relocation is not the answer to poverty or its concentration. We cannot abandon or demolish whole neighborhoods because too many poor people live there. We need to fix distressed neighborhoods and enforce fair housing laws. In reality the vast majority of people who live in these stigmatized areas have middle-class aspirations and are doing their best to give their kids a chance.

Not well known to those who live in other neighborhoods are the many residents who devote their time to helping neighbors and working for change. Our policies need to support and reward that work. We must invest in decent schools and services, demand more respectful and effective policing and through media coverage, educational materials and public meetings actively challenge racist stereotypes that have caused generations of damage to our people and our cities."

All that’s left to do is to activate your behavior-monitoring device — the gadget hanging from your neck that tracks your tone of voice, your heart rate and your physical movements throughout the day, sending real-time reports to your supervisor.

A scene from a dystopian movie? Nope. It’s already happening in America. Welcome to the brave new world of workplace biosurveillance.

It’s obvious that wearable tracking technology has gone mainstream: Just look at the explosion of smart watches and activity monitors that allow people to count steps and check their calorie intake. But this technology has simultaneously been creeping into workplace: The military uses sensors that scan for injuries, monitor heart rate and check hydration. More and more, professional athletes are strapping on devices that track every conceivable dimension of performance. Smart ice skates that measure a skater’s jump. Clothes measure an athlete’s breathing and collect muscle data. At this year’s tryouts in Indianapolis, some NFL hopefuls wore the “Adidas miCoach,” a device that sends data on speed and acceleration straight to trainers’ iPads. Over the objection of many athletes, coaches and team owners are keen to track off-the-field activity, too, such as sleep patterns and diet. With million-dollar players at stake, big money seems poised to trump privacy.

Now employers from industries that don’t even require much physical labor are getting in on the game.

Finance is adopting sophisticated analytics to ensure business performance from high-dollar employees. Cambridge neuroscientist and former Goldman Sachs trader John Coates works with companies to figure out how monitoring biological signals can lead to trading success; his research focuses on measuring hormones that increase confidence and other desirable states as well as those that produce negative, stressful states. In a report for Bloomberg, Coates explained that he is working with “three or four hedge funds” to apply an “early-warning system” that would alert supervisors when traders are getting into the hormonal danger zone. He calls this process “human optimization.”

People who do the most basic, underpaid work in our society are increasingly subject to physical monitoring, too — and it extends far beyond the ubiquitous urine test. Bank of America has started using smart badges that monitor the voice and behavior patterns of call-center workers, partnering with the creepily named Humanyze, a company specializing in “people analytics.” Humanyze is the brainchild of the MIT Media Lab, the fancy research institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology dedicated to the “betterment of humanity,” which, incidentally, receives a quarter of its funding from taxpayers. Humanyze concocted a computer dashboard complete with graphs and pie charts that can display the location of employees (Were you hanging out in the lounge today?) and their “social context” (Do you spend a lot of time alone?).

Humanyze founder Ben Waber points out that companies already spend enormous resources collecting analytics on their customers. Why not their employees?

A growing number of workers are being monitored by GPS, often installed on their smartphones. In the U.S. the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officials need awarrant in use GPS devices to track a suspect. But employers don’t worry over such formalities in keeping tabs on employees, especially those who are mobile, such as truck drivers. A Washington Post report on GPS surveillance noted a 2012 study by the research firm Aberdeen Group, which showed that 62 percent of “field employees” —those who regularly perform duties away from the office — are tracked this way. In May, a California woman filed a lawsuit against her former employer, Intermex Wire Transfer, for forcing her to install a tracking app on her phone, which she was required to keep on 24/7. She described feeling like a prisoner wearing an ankle bracelet. After removing the app, the woman was fired."

I’m talking about the Democratic primary, although the Republican side is usually interesting in its own special way. Beltway pundits are beginning to think that Bernie Sanders has a good shot at the nomination. And it may be even better than they think.

A New York Times/CBS poll released late Wednesday showed Hillary Clinton leading Sanders, 48 to 41 percent — down from a 20 point lead a month ago. Sanders showed a nearly 2-to-1 lead among voters under 45 years old. A Monmouth University poll released on Jan. 12 showed Sanders ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire by 14 percentage points (53 to 39). A Quinnipiac poll released the same day showed Sanders erased Clinton’s lead in Iowa and was ahead by 5 percentage points.

On the standard political story, victories in Iowa and New Hampshire could provide momentum for Sanders and change the dynamics of the race. But the way in which this happens is also important for understanding the present situation. The Iowa caucuses will be held on Feb. 1, just 18 days from now. New Hampshire Democrats will vote on Feb. 9. The voters in these contests are the ones who have been paying the most attention to the candidates and to the issues. And Sanders is leading in both of them. This means that the national polls, which still show Clinton in the lead, may be skewed by the lack of engagement of these voters. The numbers could change quickly once people get to know a little bit more about Clinton’s challenger.

This is what happened in 2008, when a freshman senator from Illinois named Barack Obama scored an upset victory against Clinton, whose nomination had been considered inevitable. In fact, two and a half weeks before the Iowa caucuses — which is where we are now, Obama was trailing Clinton by 6 points there and was about even in New Hampshire. And he was down by as much as 29 points to her nationally.

And at that time in the 2008 presidential primary race, Obama was not quite even with Clinton in South Carolina. But after he won Iowa and voters got a closer look at him, he beat Clinton there by 29 percentage points.

History could repeat itself, and it is clear from Clinton’s escalating criticisms of Sanders that she is worried about it. Another hefty chunk of déjà vu: MoveOn.org, one of the most powerful Internet grass-roots forces in the Democratic primary — or the country, for that matter — voted overwhelming on Sunday to endorse Bernie Sanders. MoveOn was a key player in the 2008 primary and mobilized tens of thousands of volunteers as well as money for Obama. With its endorsement this week, it has pledged to organize its 43,000 members in Iowa and 30,000 in New Hampshire. This could easily make the difference in Iowa, where 239,000 votes were cast in the 2008 caucuses (a record turnout)."

Every year since 1974, the United Nations General Assembly has passed a laudable Egyptian-sponsored resolution calling for the Middle East to become a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Starting five years later, the U.N. began repeatedly passing an Egyptian-authored resolution calling on Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which it would disarm and place its nuclear materials under international inspection. But these resolutions are nonbinding, and the leading Arab state’s calls to focus on Israel’s arsenal of at least 80 nuclear warheads are usually ignored by Western powers.

That reality is unlikely to change this year. But it should.

The July signing of the Iran nuclear accord is certain to produce political clashes at the U.N. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won’t be able to resist railing against the deal in front of the world. But the expected focus on the Iranian nuclear program makes the U.N. General Assembly, which opens its 70th session on Tuesday, the perfect opportunity to probe another nuclear program in the Middle East — one that has actually produced a weapon, unlike Iran’s.

The Iran accord, which curbs the country’s nuclear enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief, was a victory for advocates of nuclear disarmament. It blocks the Islamic Republic’s ability to build a nuclear weapon, making the world, especially the Middle East, a safer place.

A probe of Israeli warheads, on the other hand, has been delayed by the United States for too long. But it’s an issue that needs to be taken up to avoid dangerous tensions, setbacks to nuclear disarmament and other states in the region pursuing their own nuclear and chemical weapons programs.

It is now Israel’s turn to renounce nuclear arms, as Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif argued in a July column for The Guardian. Of course, Zarif wants to score points against a state that has long railed against virtually any move Iran makes, be it political or military. But his main point — that the Middle East would be safer without nuclear weapons — is sound."

The son of the Palestinian Authority president Tareq Abbas is already said to own villas in Amman, Jordan and a rooftop pad in Beirut, Lebanon.

Now, according to a review of official British Land Registry records from 2012, the world can know Tareq registered - under his legal name - the purchase of a $1.5m luxury two-bedroom flat in Merchant Square East, one of London's many high-end developments.

Realtors hawked Tareq's newest address as a ""prestigious waterside building"" in a ""chic, contemporary style with high-specification amenities and furnishings"" within walking distance of an area full of ""traditional old English pubs and new bars and restaurants"".

The building itself is part of ""regeneration"" taking place around Paddington Basin to increase investment and property value.

Tareq's flat has stayed largely unoccupied since he bought it, which seems to indicate that he does not need the rental income he could derive from its purchase. A quick calculation shows he could fetch about $4,300 per month in rent.

It was so left to apparent neglect that lawyers representing Merchant Square threatened to sue him in 2014 for ""breach of obligations"" for more than $6,700 in unpaid parking and storage fees, which he later paid.

Tareq failed to respond to Al Jazeera's questions about his finances or how he came to own the place. No doubt he is aware that most Palestinians, with an average yearly gross national income of $3,060, couldn't afford to rent the London apartment of their president's son for even a single month.

Nor is Tareq the only multimillionaire in the Abbas family. The president's eldest living son, Yasser, made his fortunes from, among other things, the monopoly sale of US-made cigarettes in the occupied territories, offering Lucky Strikes and other carcinogens to Palestine's tobacco-addicted.

Which must leave Palestinians wondering: are their financial blessings merely the result of being ""Grade A businessmen"", as Yasser once famously remarked?

The brothers Abbas enjoy a personal wealth that eludes nearly all their compatriots. Average Palestinians could hardly be faulted for questioning whether Papa President played a part. (Attorneys for Yasser claim the reverse is true - that ""politics often affects the business of Mr Abbas negatively"".)

Thankfully, the public now has more information from which to form a view. As recently reported in Ha'aretz, leaked records from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca show Tareq Abbas as having at least $982,000 in shares of the Arab Palestinian Investment Company (APIC), a British Virgin Island incorporated firm where he serves as a board member.

The same tranche of Panama Papers also revealed that the Palestinian Authority's billion-dollar investment portfolio, the Palestinian Investment Fund (PIF), owns 18 percent of APIC.

Incidentally, President Abbas, as head of the Palestinian Authority, wields significant influence over the PIF's activities. I presume his children would have us believe their dad leaves the room any time APIC or his children's business pursuits are mentioned in the course of his official duties.

Little wonder that a May 2016 poll reported on by the Associated Press showed that almost all Palestinians - 95.5 percent - believe there is corruption in Abbas' government.

But you won't hear much public airing about these complaints within the little Area A statelet President Abbas lords over like a mini Caesar. This is territory, of course, where dissidents are disappeared and tortured, websites are closed, and journalists are surveilled and harassed.

But that doesn't stop people from thinking that corruption is rampant. Since his own kids do so little to correct that widely held impression, one can only conclude they don't give a damn. Why should they?

The last time Abbas faced the voters was 10 years ago, and no future poll is in the offing.

As for managing negative publicity, Tareq should know a thing or two about how to minimise it. He has held a variety of profitable leadership functions with the Ramallah-based Sky Advertising Company over the years, and now serves as Sky's Chairman of the Board.

During Tareq's tenure, the firm has helped to bring in an eclectic range of international heavyweight companies, including Qatar's Ooredoo/Wataniya Mobile, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), even the BBC World Service.

Left off Sky's corporate website is Tareq's earlier involvement in a controversial US government contract, as previously revealed by Reuters news agency. His Sky Advertising Company took a sizeable piece of a $2m tender from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) back in 2006.

Sky's specific mission was to ""improve the image of the United States in the occupied territories"", which then, as now, is sorely in need of improving.

Former US President George W Bush's 2002 ""roadmap for peace"", endorsed by President Abbas, aimed for a Palestinian state by the end of 2005. The music stopped as 2005 came and went, and no doubt the embarrassed and double-crossed Palestinian Authority officials went scrambling for chairs.

The Americans may have sent them on a fool's errand. But at least they were charitable enough to throw the president's kid a contract to make some money.

Alas, nearly 10 years later, we learn that Tareq was kind enough to recycle his hard-earned occupation dollars back into the Western economy.

To the country, no less, that gave rise to Lord Balfour and his declaration promising another people a home on the land where his father once lived. The octogenarian long ago ceded his own right to return and live in Safed some day.

And the two-state prospect President Abbas held out for all these years is now more remote than ever.

As for his son, if there won't be Palestine, there will always be London. And I suspect the child of privilege does not care if you know he can enjoy it at any time.

The group wasted no time in announcing the elevation of its military commander, Qassim al-Raymi, to become the group's new leader.



Many are wondering what this means for the organisation and what direction it may take under Raymi's leadership.

Al Jazeera's recent investigation, ""al-Qaeda Informant"", provides new insights - and staggering claims - about the possible double-role Raymi played within the group.



The documentary film presents the testimony of Hani Mujahid, a former AQAP operative who doubled as an informant for the Yemeni security services. Mujahid describes Raymi, as ""a creation of Yemen's National Security Bureau"".

Like Raymi, Mujahid is a Yemeni who joined Bin Laden's call to the holy war. Between 1998 and 2002, Mujahid became close to both Raymi and Wuhaishi, fighting alongside them in Afghanistan.

Mujahid fled to Pakistan in 2002 where he was captured and interrogated for months in 2004. He was deported back to Yemen and jailed for two years. Raymi and Wuhaishi would also return home, ending up in a Yemeni prison until they escaped by digging a tunnel in 2006. Around the same time, Mujahid walked out, rejoined his former peers, and began informing against them.



A key allegation of the film was Raymi's alleged relationship with Colonel Ammar Mohammed Abdullah Saleh, the feared number two of Yemen's National Security Bureau. Colonel Saleh allegedly served as Hani Mujahid's handler. He is also the powerful nephew of Yemen's then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh.





Mujahid described a time when he met with Colonel Saleh to debrief him on a three-way secret meeting in Shabwa province between himself, Wuhaishi, and Raymi. He says he failed to recount a few of their conversation details. Colonel Saleh astonished him, saying words to the effect of ""you have forgotten so and so and so"". Mujahid sat ashen-faced.

""He reminded me of the entire story. I was mesmerised. Because in that session there was only myself, Abu Huraira [Raymi] and Abu Basir [Wuhaishi]. So, how did Ammar Muhammed Abdullah Saleh know this? He said to me clearly: Look, you see this chair you are sitting in now? Before you there was Abu Huraira [Raymi], sitting in it.""



Mujahid began to contemplate whether Raymi fits the informant profile. Unlike his deputy, Wuhaishi was quiet, extremely pious, humble and soft-spoken.

""Raymi loves to joke. He is always smiling. But at times he is a little mischievous. He tries to provoke you.""

Mujahid began to wonder whether Raymi was really a government informant just like him. For obvious reasons, it was never a question he could put to him.

In time, additional dealings with Colonel Saleh would provide Mujahid the evidence he needed. Mujahid admitted carrying money from Colonel Saleh to Raymi with the former’s full knowledge. Colonel Saleh instructed him to tell Raymi that the money ""came from a local charity"".



For Mujahid, Raymi's mask of cooperation with the Yemeni government was again revealed just ahead of the September 17, 2008 attack against the US embassy in Sanaa that killed 19 people.

In the months of planning before, Mujahid went to Colonel Saleh to announce AQAP needed explosives. Mujahid claims that Colonel Ammar arranged the explosives, instructing Mujahid to tell Raymi that a local sheikh in Khawlan province would provide them.



In light of Wuhaishi's death and Raymi's ascension to lead the world's most lethal branch of al-Qaeda, much of Mujahid's testimony - soundbites that didn't make the final cut - deserve further review.



Mujahid pointed out to Al Jazeera in 2014 how many of AQAP's leaders have been eviscerated in the US-led drone campaign. Every one - that is, except Raymi - who has also miraculously survived Yemeni security force raids as well as cruise missile strikes.

Mujahid intimates that, because Raymi was collaborating with Ali Abdullah Saleh’s government, he had all along been spared:



""Qassim al-Raymi comes from Rima…How is it that this man is not getting killed? It is impossible for someone to come from outside of the tribe and live in a strange tribe. His looks, his dialect are different, and when you are a stranger, you become an easy target for the Americans. The sons of the tribes can hide. Indeed, many of the leaders whom Ali Abdullah Saleh could not contain were liquidated using drones as well as in ground ambushes.



…I know many shabab who were offered to work in the National Security Bureau but they refused. As a result they were severely harassed by the security. They were forced to go to Abyan and to Hadramout where they were liquidated with drones upon the assumption that they were leading figures within Al-Qaeda organisation posing a danger to the USA.



…Many of the veteran Al-Qaeda shabab have had suspicions about Qassim al-Raymi and they talk about these. Some of these shabab were quite close to Sheikh Osama bin Laden. For this reason, there has been real animosity between the shabab in Taiz, in Sanaa and in some of the provinces - and these are the veteran shabab - and Qassim al-Raymi. It has gone as far as threatening to kill each other.



Why? Because they are convinced that the man is playing with al-Qaeda organisation an intelligence game and they have realised that he does indeed have ties with Ammar Muhammed Abdullah Saleh.



Al Jazeera was able to corroborate Mujahid’s claims and activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But his allegations whilst working in Yemen remain just that. We do not know if Mujahid was fibbing, embellishing, score-settling or, as one veteran intelligence official remarked, ""prey to a conspiratorial mindset"".



Perhaps. Alternatively, Raymi has survived these years for a reason. That line of thinking would suggest Raymi is part of a sinister double-game that has shielded him from capture and drone targeting all these years. Even in life Mujahid told us that Wuhaihsi was more or less a ceremonial figurehead within AQAP, with Raymi pulling the real strings.

Was Wuhaishi's killing the ultimate power play? Could his location have been given up by a rival within AQAP or by security services loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh?



These are incredible claims, ones seemingly unimaginable in scope and audacity. Yet given how the unthinkable always seems to prevail in today’s world, they deserve further investigation.



To that end, Mujahid has said he is willing to testify before any international organisation. Since Mujahid’s testimony in our June 4 broadcast, a Spanish prosecutor asked to reopen a criminal case investigating a 2007 AQAP attack in Yemen’s Marib province that killed eight of its citizens. Yemen’s exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi also issued a decree removing Ammar Mohammed Abdullah Saleh from his diplomatic posting in Ethiopia, calling for him to face a military trial. He is believed to have sought refuge in the United Arab Emirates.



A criminal investigation that vets both Mujahid and Yemeni officials named in our film may be the surest way to understand whether Raymi was a controlled asset or outright Yemeni government informant. Alternatively, given Colonel Saleh's close relations to the American security services - during years it believed Yemen was its partner in the ""global war on terror"" - these may be answers the West just does not want to know.



Suffice it to say, many AQAP victims would like to know. For Nasser Wuhaishi, Anwar al-Awlaki and the many dozens of other unlucky AQAP leaders killed by drones as Raymi escaped, I suspect they might too.

Special Services Division and Raza v. City of New York. Both lawsuits alleged the NYPD had engaged in discriminatory and unconstitutional surveillance of Muslims in the years following 9/11. The settlement puts in place some additional safeguards to protect over-surveiled communities from unwarranted or discriminatory policing at the hands of New York’s men in blue. Most of these changes will be made via revisions to the Handschu Guidelines, the set of rules put in place in 1986 to restrict NYPD infiltration of political and religious groups,

This should come as good news for anyone concerned about the effects of 9/11 and the war on terror has had on our civil liberties. But unless we acknowledge the limitations of the settlement, we risk portraying the NYPD as a reformed institution, while the full impact of its invasive and potentially unlawful surveillance activities are brushed under the rug.

In the fall, I reported a series of stories for Gothamist about an undercover NYPD detective, “Mel” or “Melike,” who joined the Islamic Society at Brooklyn College in the spring of 2011 after taking the shahada, or profession of faith. The group of young Muslim women Mel infiltrated and befriended taught her how to pray and welcomed her into their homes. They invited her to join them on social outings and brought her to Islamic education classes and talks. In time, Mel was privy to some of the most intimate and important moments of their lives, once even attending a wedding as a bridesmaid. The undercover detective maintained contact with some of the former students until as recently as January of this year. The investigation at Brooklyn College did not result in any arrests.

Nothing in the settlement would necessarily prevent what happened at Brooklyn College from taking place again. Yes, New Yorkers will benefit from more specific language about what can prompt an investigation, firmer time limits on investigations, additional constitutional protections and greater consideration given to the potential harm of the use of undercover agents. Yet in some respects the Handschu Guidelines will remain murky and incomplete, a fact which the NYPD has previously exploited to expand their surveillance activities. For example, the Guidelines do not explicitly prohibit undercover agents from having contact with former targets or community members after an investigation has closed. That’s how the NYPD justified “Mel” maintaining relationships with some Brooklyn College students for so many years. The new time limits outlined in the settlement will only apply to open investigations.

Similarly, even without an ongoing investigation, the NYPD can still attend events “on the same terms as members of the public generally.” It remains unclear what specifics the NYPD holds to establish that an event is “public” or if a common parlance understanding of “public” might sometimes be reinterpreted to suit investigative needs.

Then there is the question of oversight. The settlement mandates the formal creation of a Handschu Committee — which will include a civilian lawyer appointed by the Mayor alongside NYPD officials — to review and ask questions about proposed or ongoing investigations."

While it appears that President Enrique Peña Nieto’s ruling party coalition will retain its slim majority in the lower house of Congress, the triumph of independent candidates at the state and local levels shows that disenchanted voters are welcoming outside reformers to challenge the status quo.

The elections took place at a complex political moment. Recent polling has shown that distrust for political institutions is at an all-time high, mainly because of corruption scandals and ongoing violence.

Last November, journalists uncovered a conflict of interest involving Peña Nieto’s wife, who it was revealed had used her position as the First Lady to buy a luxurious residence at a discounted price from a government contractor. Peña Nieto tried in vain to address the revelations. The incident only affirmed widespread perception of politicians as corrupt and indifferent to the public good and likely chipped away at the popularity of the president’s ruling coalition in Congress.

The elections also took place eight months after the abduction in Guerrero state of 43 students from a teachers’ college. The fate of the students, who were presumably kidnapped by police and handed over to a drug cartel, remains unknown. The students’ disappearance triggered protests in every major city, but the political elite merely pointed fingers at each other and avoided taking responsibility.

Observers called the campaign period one of the most violent in recent memory: Eight candidates were killed, as well as a number of campaign staff members. Protests erupted in the southern states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, where teachers threatened to boycott the elections. The federal government sent soldiers to Guerrero before the election to ensure things ran smoothly, but on Sunday there were reports of violent clashes between police and protesters. The elections saw the lowest turnout in 15 years, with early results reporting that only 40 percent of voters showed up at the polls."

In 2015, the president finally saw some victories. The “new era of American diplomacy” he promised during his first run for the White House finally bore fruit; his diplomatic efforts are making foreign relations a little bit better. But in other ways, circumstances also got a lot worse in 2015 — not necessarily because of things Obama did, but sometimes because of things he didn’t do, namely large-scale military interventions. 2015’s heady mixture of success and failure make it the banner year to assess Obama’s two-pronged foreign policy doctrine that has dominated his two terms in office: a reluctance to become entrenched in new wars except for limited interventions (usually airstrikes) and the dogged pursuit of diplomacy. But which — unwillingness to fully engage military or the readiness to pursue diplomacy — will win out when it comes to Obama’s foreign policy legacy? First, the diplomacy: Just before ringing last year in, Obama announced a dramatic shift in America’s Cuba policy, ending decades of broken relations with the Communist dictatorship and promising further openings to come between the U.S. and the island nation. It would prove to be a harbinger for the year. Midway through 2015, the Obama administration, along with the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany, inked a nuclear agreement with Iran, addressing what he and his implacable critics had both said was one of the greatest threats to the world, the potential for Iran to acquire the bomb. Then, to round out the year in December, the White House joined other world governments and signed a landmark climate change agreement at a United Nations conference in Paris. All three are remarkable achievements, requiring staunch focus in the face of opposition from powerful special interests and lobby groups. And yet Obama’s foreign policy accomplishments during his penultimate year in office are likely to be overshadowed — not necessarily in importance, but in public perception — as the year that the Syrian civil war finally caught up to the rest of the world, including the U.S. Refugees flooding Europe from the Middle East reached a breaking point and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) continued running amok, both in Syria and Iraq and, importantly, in the West. Obama’s approach to the Syria crisis has followed another of his pre-Oval Office stances: “I'm opposed to dumb wars,” he said in 2002. Though calling for regime change in Syria, Obama took small steps such as arming some small revolutionary factions, but never threw the full strength of the U.S. military behind the effort. Now, his diplomatic inclinations to end the war will, despite continuing proclamations that Bashar al-Assad must go, will likely mean the pursuit of a deal to end the war that might leaves Assad in power.

Though ISIL’s rampaging through 2015, with Obama’s underwhelming response, is likely to dominate the news, the real story of the year is the successes of diplomacy."

That makes sense, since they’re both members of the same political party; we’re not watching a rematch of “Rocky IV” here.

But conservatives aren’t the only ones calling Sanders a capitalist stooge. At Vox, Ezra Klein explains that “Sanders isn’t a socialist. He’s a democratic socialist. The difference is big, and it’s real.” In Klein’s version, Sanders and Hillary Clinton represent two sides of the (capitalist) Democratic Party: one that trusts Big Business and one that doesn’t. Hillary is a “new Democrat” who holds a special place in her heart for corporate executives, and Bernie is an “old Democrat” who wants to regulate and tax them and use the proceeds to fund public-welfare programs. Sanders shares his politics with the mainstream center-left parties just about everywhere else in the world.

At The American Conservative, a publication one might expect to be frothing with rage over the Bolsheviks on TV, Samuel Goldman writes that “Democrats are not socialists, and neither is Bernie Sanders.” While socialists seek popular control over the means of economic production, Goldman argues, Democrats support “regulated competition and redistributive policies that direct private profits toward the relative losers in market exchange.” It’s New Deal–style welfarism, he writes, not socialism. I guess conservatives won’t call you a socialist unless you don’t want them to.

For years, Barack Obama has been trying to convince a sizable portion of Americans that he is not, in fact, a socialist. To be fair to the president, he’s really not. But now that the Democratic Party has an openly socialist candidate in Bernie Sanders, commentators aren’t quite so sure they believe him. After a debate performance in which Sanders was made to answer for his ideology and declared himself an anti-capitalist, publications across the ideological spectrum were questioning his leftist bona fides in a way that seems even stranger than watching presidential candidates debating capitalism by name.

Even though Sanders wants his city and country to be shrewd when negotiating with big corporations, he still plays by their rules.

As the one proud socialist on the Senate’s left fringe, you might think Sanders isn’t used to this precise kind of ideological scrutiny. That isn’t the case. He has been hearing that he’s “just a Democrat” for 30 years. In the pages of the November-December 1986 edition of Socialist Review, Sanders — then the mayor of Burlington, Vermont — was denounced as a sellout in blistering terms. In his essay “The Bernie Sanders paradox: When socialism grows old,” political theorist and fellow Vermonter Murray Bookchin wrote of the mayor, “To mock his stolid behavior and the surprising conventionality of his values is to conceal his commitment to ’30s belief in technological progress, businesslike efficiency and a naive adherence to the benefits of ‘growth.’” Like Heer, Bookchin doesn’t see the big difference.

Bookchin was working from an ideological rivalry with Sanders — he was a libertarian socialist, which has more in common with anarchism than Denmark — but as a politically engaged resident of Burlington, he got a close look at how Sanders’ beliefs translated into action. He was not impressed by what he saw. “Bernard Sanders’ version of socialism is proving to be a subtle instrument for rationalizing the marketplace — not for controlling it, much less threatening it,” he complained.

In particular, Bookchin focused on a lakeside development plan aggressively backed by the mayor. While residents used town-hall democracy to ask for open space and public access, the Sanders administration backed a proposal for a Radisson Hotel expansion, a parking garage and luxury condos with the classic developer argument that the plan would provide jobs and tax revenue. It’s the kind of classic sellout move that belongs in a kid’s movie or a Counting Crows song, and when Sanders asked the public to approve a city bond for the plan, he was turned down not by arriviste yuppies but his working-class base.

“The ultimate effect of Sanders’ aging form of ‘socialism,’” Bookchin wrote, “is to facilitate the ease with which business interests can profit from the city.” He even went so far as to compare Sanders’ taxpayer-funded development plan with Ronald Reagan’s trickle-down economics. “This ‘managerial radicalism’ with its technocratic bias and its corporate concern for expansion is bourgeois to the core — and even brings the authenticity of traditional ‘socialist’ canons into grave question.”

In short: Even though Sanders wants the city (or country) to be shrewd when negotiating with big corporations, he still plays by their rules.

For Bookchin, the rise of Bernie Sanders was a matter of grim concern for the whole American radical community and a personal disappointment. He’s not running for mayor as a radical anymore; he’s running for president as a Democrat, and the country, from the right to the left, seems to realize that. At least Sanders’ campaign offers a clarification about what capitalism is and what it means to be against it — even if he doesn’t realize what side he’s on."

He plays the violin. He plays sports. He volunteers. He owns one share of stock in Tesla. So he’s clearly going places. I’d invest in him if I could,” the President told the press corps.

These days “investable” is high praise for a 13-year-old, and Antonio was in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building as a poster child for the latest round of federal education reform. But there’s a central contradiction in American education rhetoric between the universalism and the outstanding example: How can every student be exceptional?

The name of George W. Bush’s 2001 No Child Left Behind Act was roundly panned in liberal circles as another egregious example of the administration’s doublespeak — John Kerry called it “one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky.” The law’s plan was to raise every student to adequate performance in testable subjects and create a floor for American education. It didn’t work out that way (unsurprisingly), but the law’s framing stuck. After all, no politician wants to run on leaving some children behind to ignorance and menial employment.

As a name, “Every Student Succeeds” ups the ante on “No Child Left Behind.” Adequacy is by definition a low standard, and being merely satisfactory doesn’t necessarily lead to better life outcomes than inadequacy. If public schools are preparing some students to succeed (and they had better be), then the schools must set up all students to succeed, or at least provide them the opportunity. “We want to make sure that through this piece of legislation, with our hard work, with our focus, with our discipline, with our passion, with our commitment, that every kid is given the same opportunities that Antonio is getting,” Obama said.

The President says he’s talking about opportunities, but he’s also talking about outcomes. It’s one thing to want all kids to have access to advanced classes, music instruction, sports teams and volunteer work. It’s another to expect them to take advantage of all of them at the same time. President Obama described Antonio as “doing his part” with his full load of curricular and extracurricular activities, but every student can’t be prepared for college: There just aren’t enough seats. Because admission is limited and competitive, only the top two-thirds or so can be, by definition, prepared for higher education. No matter how hard they work, how brilliant they are, the lowest-scoring cohort will be labeled unprepared and accused of not “doing their part.”"

At 36, former Pittsburgh Steeler Antwaan Randle El has trouble walking down stairs and remembering things he was just told. Even legendary coach Mike Ditka now says he wouldn’t let a child of his play the sport.

The game is dangerous for players. It’s hard on their families, friends and girlfriends. And as a recent spate of lawsuits suggests, it is miserable for those whose job it is to support them: the cheerleaders.

Unlike the players, the cheerleaders, who frequently work 10 or more hours a day, earn next to nothing. Over the last two years, cheerleaders have filed lawsuits against the Oakland Raiders, the Cincinnati Bengals, the Buffalo Bills, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the New York Jets and other franchises. The suit brought by a cheerleader for the Raiders claims the team violated the California Labor Code by paying her and her colleagues just $1,250 for an entire season — equivalent to less than $5 an hour.

Last year the Buccaneers were forced to pay $825,000 to settle a class-action lawsuit. The Raiders had to pay $1.25 million in 2014. But the women whose suits have succeeded haven’t become rich overnight. The Buccaneers’ payout resulted in each cheerleader receiving about $3,445 a season for up to five seasons. The Raiders agreed to pay each cheerleader about $6,000 for each season worked from 2010 to 2012 and $2,500 for the 2013 season. That’s essentially minimum wage, the absolute least that they should have made all along.

The NFL brought in an estimated $12 billion last year — 14 percent more than the year before — with the money split evenly among the 32 teams in the league. This means each team gets hundreds of millions of dollars. Players are the most important part of the game, and accordingly, they get about half of the NFL’s revenue. Cheerleaders get a fraction of a percent, usually only after they sue. By contrast, NFL mascots make a minimum of $23,000 per season for leading the fans in doing the whip nae nae.

Most teams argue that their cheerleaders are independent contractors rather than regular employees, meaning they don’t need to be paid minimum wage. This claim is belied by both the hours cheerleaders are expected to work and the conditions under which they do. Regulations related to personal appearance show that cheerleaders aren’t just grossly underpaid; they are routinely humiliated. Before the squad was disbanded, cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills, known as the Buffalo Jills, were ordered to do jumping jacks so their supervisors could see if their flesh jiggled. The team dictated the color of the women’s hair and issued them detailed instructions about vaginal freshness."

Greece’s landscape is indeed beautiful, and its olives are delicious, but Greece’s global competitive edge is in science, education, technology and entrepreneurship. The problem is that the country has done little to foster this native talent.

While Greeks make up less than 0.2 percent of the global population, they represent approximately 3 percent of the most influential (that is, most cited) scientists in the world. These great minds flourish mostly away from their native land. Greece has an astonishingly high 6.2 physicians per 1000 inhabitants, but thousands of Greek MDs have migrated to Germany and other countries lacking well-trained doctors. In computer science, seven of the 200 most-cited scientists worldwide are born and educated in Greece, but living elsewhere. Greece remains one of the top countries with regard to the proportion of its people attending university. Numerous Greeks feature as entrepreneur leaders in Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the City. Fifteen of the 100 most influential shipping industry people worldwide are Greek, again, mostly operating in other countries.

As I mentioned in my recent Dimitri Trichopoulos memorial lecture combining data from citation databases such as Google Scholar and from biographies and obituaries, among the 32 most-cited Greek scientists who had died by November 2014, only four died in Greece: one while fleeing to avoid being killed by his enemies, one by accident, one from cancer shortly after repatriation and one during vacation. If one could somehow count people not where they live but where their roots are, Greece may have been the leading hub for science, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship in Europe. Needless to say, this is not the case.

A main reason is that Greece has been so poorly run that talented Greek nationals have been fleeing the country of their own volition. Mediocre governments on the right and the left were silently tolerated because they were receiving sufficient European funds to distribute to their party followers. State mechanisms remained hostile to private innovation. When economic crisis hit hard and funds dried up, the state’s incompetence became floridly evident. It was thus wholly unsurprising when, in early 2015, radical left and far-right parties jointly rose to power.

There is no sense in debating whether Greek politicians are more corrupt than their European or American counterparts; personally, I am convinced they are all the same. However, any system runs on inertia until major crisis sets chaos in motion. The current government rightly identified that blunt austerity is leading nowhere. However, instead of working on pro-growth solutions, it mobilized the national psyche to total absurdity with pleas to “dignity,” “pride” and “democracy.”"

They often assess data without considering the larger context, which can lead them to exaggerate the good or bad news. And since most economists and economic reporters move in herds, we get dramatic tales of booms and busts in the business section that don’t necessarily correspond to anything in the real world.

We were treated to one such artificial boom late last year and at the start of 2015. It was based on positive economic data in the second half of 2014 that showed the economy growing at a 4.1 percent rate through the last three quarters of 2014. MSNBC headlined a web piece, “U.S. economic growth soars, reaches 11-year high”; Newsweek headlined a Reuters piece it ran, “Boom: U.S. economy takes off in the 3rd quarter.” The usually astute columnist Matt O’Brien told readers: “The economic boom is still very much alive.”

This bout of euphoria quickly faded with the winter frost. Suddenly, commentators were complaining that consumers were no longer prepared to spend the way they used to. A Washington Post piece speculated that consumer psychology had been permanently changed by the 2008-09 recession. The Wall Street Journal went a step further with one of its economics reporters writing a column to “stingy American consumers” begging them to spend more money. (Incidentally, the latest data show that American consumers are spending more — although probably not as a result of a letter from the Wall Street Journal.)

There is a banal explanation for this rapid switch from boom to bust, as well as for the original boom itself: the weather. The weather was unusually bad throughout the Northeast and Midwest this year, and snowfall in major metropolitan areas such as Boston hit new records. When it’s cold, when there’s a lot of snow on the ground and when the streets are blocked, people are less likely to go out to dinner or shop for clothes. They are also likely to put off buying a car or looking for a new house. As a result, consumption is likely to be much weaker than would otherwise be the case.

Of course, Boston and dozens of other cities get snow almost every winter; this routinely disrupts peoples’ regular consumption patterns. That’s why our data are seasonally adjusted; it doesn’t matter that we get six inches or a foot of snow in the Northeast if that’s what was expected. It only skews the numbers when we get six feetof snow, which was the case in Boston this year. So when winter is worse than usual, the economy — in real life, and particularly in the papers — suffers."

The SDGs aim to eradicate poverty, build sustainable cities and combat climate change. Unlike the Millennium Development Goals, which were largely assigned in a top-down manner in New York and Geneva, the SDGs were conceived more democratically after three years of deliberation by a group of representatives from 70 countries. In addition to government representation, there was a high-level panel that included representatives from civil society, the private sector and academia, alongside local and national governments. In fact, the U.N. conducted the largest consultation in its history to shape the SDGs. These conversations included thematic and national discussions in addition to door-to-door surveys that sought feedback from a variety of stakeholders.

Perhaps as a result of this collaborative process, one of the objectives calls for “responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels,” calling for a new type of civic engagement that isn’t limited to elections and includes citizens in local governance and political decision-making.

What does it mean to engage citizens in governance? That’s a tricky question, not least because the definition of governance varies immensely from country to country. This is in part because of different structural, political and societal frameworks. For example, several countries are resource rich but give citizens little say in how their wealth is allocated or managed. In Albania, Tanzania and Mali, for example, greater transparency and accountability for the extractive industries will be a key issue for more inclusive government.

The lack of a common definition of governance complicates ambitious global attempts toward political development, but the United Nations’ SDGs treat this diversity of opinions as a strength. Instead of imposing specific targets and the means to achieve them, the SDGs will rely on local governments and civil societies to forge their own paths toward nationally relevant targets. To this end, there are 48 countries taking part in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to create an international standard for the management of natural resource revenues."

Coates and Samori are riding an escalator to exit the theater. Samori, who is doe-eyed beautiful, moves too slowly to suit a white woman on the escalator; the woman pushes him and says, “Come on.” Her tone is not described, but Coates reports his furious response in vivid detail. His rage leads to a loud argument with the woman and then with bystanders who come to her defense. Coates pushes one of the defenders, to which the defender responds, “I could have you arrested!”

Coates is a black man, a member of a socially constructed people who, he points out, have existed in America longer as slaves than as free citizens. And while it might be tempting to interpret the woman’s push and her words as ambivalent, or perhaps even as benevolent, for Coates they must have been stunningly resonant with the social disregard and legal erasure that black parents endured in slavery and in post-slavery apprentice systems — in which black children were apprenticed to former masters, sometimes against their parents’ wishes — and that they continue to endure in the racially disproportionate surveillance of clumsy child welfare systems.

As slaves, Coates’ people lived what sociologist Orlando Patterson calls a social death. A slave had no legally recognized family status. Slaves were the property of owners rather than the children of parents. Enslaved parents had no legal right to supervise, or even to keep custody of their children — who could be disciplined at will by owners or sold at any time to distant masters. We can only imagine the psychological consequences of the slave parent’s legal and social incapacity, but we have historical records and slave narratives to guide us.

We have a letter written by a freedman to the governor of North Carolina in 1869 to ask how he could bring to justice a white man who ordered his son about and then beat and cursed the father for protesting. We have the autobiography “My Life in the South,” published in 1879, in which Jacob Stroyer reports that when he was “too small to work” he was given chores in a stable and beaten when he was unable to mount a horse properly. The child ran crying to his biological father, but the father could do no more than say, “Go back to your work and be a good boy, for I cannot do anything for you.” We have an interview in which a former slave recalled a time when a master tied his father up, “pulled down his breeches and whipped him right before Mammy and us children.” We have James Pennington’s memoir “The Fugitive Blacksmith,” first published in London in 1849, in which he recalls having seen his father given “fifteen or twenty” lashes that ended with the words, “I’ll make you know that I am the master of your tongue as well as of your time.” The sight, Pennington wrote, “created an open rupture” within his family.

The escalator push may also have resonated for Coates with contemporary stories of child welfare systems that interrupt, rather than support, the efforts of black mothers and fathers to raise their children. I think of a devoted father whose child was removed from his care because a $5 bag of marijuana was found in his room by staff of the shelter where father and child were living. I think of mothers who lost custody of their children because the mothers themselves had been subjected to domestic abuse. In his autobiography, Malcolm X recounts being placed in a foster care system that he came to perceive as “modern slavery.”"

Much ink has been spilled to explain Trump’s astonishing rise. Danielle Allen in The Washington Post attributed his ascent to “a solidly right-wing ethno-nationalist voting bloc.” Others say his success stems from an ideological gap between conservative elites and their constituency or from the growing perception that the country is on the wrong track. According to The Economist, some of Trump’s supporters see his boorish behavior as “a sign of authenticity.”

True, there are many lenses through which one can analyze Trump’s success in the polls. But the least analyzed aspect of his foray into politics is one that has taken shape over a much longer time frame: the vanishing distinction between politics and entertainment.

Political life has long borrowed from the theater. Trump’s latest bid is the apotheosis of what historian Daniel Boorstin called “pseudo-events” in his 1961 seminal book, “The Image.” Boorstin described a pseudo-event as an occurrence that is manufactured mainly to generate media coverage, whose “relation to the underlying reality of the situation is ambiguous” and whose “interest arises largely from this very ambiguity.”

Trump’s candidacy is a farcical made-for-television event. His previous political false starts lent an ambiguity to his intentions this cycle that generated enormous media coverage even before he formally announced his candidacy. This was followed by yet another speculative cycle about his possible bid as a third-party candidate.

“Donald Trump is summer’s biggest TV hit, and ratings gold for cable news,” read a recent headline in The Los Angeles Times, synopsizing his appeal. The story described CNN’s giddiness over landing the second Republican prime-time debate, which — with Trump as the headliner — will command steep ad rates. “He’s the Simon Cowell of politics,” Jeff Gaspin, a former NBC executive, said of the real estate mogul’s brand, referring to the former “American Idol” judge. “Why was ‘American Idol’ so successful? Because Simon said, ‘That’s the worst thing I’ve ever heard’ and made 16-year-olds cry…Trump has got that unfiltered honesty.”

That might be true. But unlike Cowell, whose success has always been tied to entertainment, Trump is importing entertainment wholesale into electoral politics. His greatest insight was that style trumps substance, especially in the early stages of primary season. (At the Iowa State Fair last month, a typical attendee waited in huge crowds to see Trump “because he’s a celebrity,” and numerous supporters have pointed to his blunt rhetoric as his core appeal.) In an August poll that asked his supporters what they most liked about him, only 14 percent cited his policies.

Trump avoids any discussion of policy specifics, and he openly mocks rivals for their perceived wonkiness, implying that a presidential campaign’s worst sin is not a paucity of ideas but having the audacity to take them seriously. This was evidenced by his recent self-parodying appearance on “The Tonight Show” with comedian Jimmy Fallon, in which Trump jocularly summed up his job creation plan as “I’m just gonna do it” and, when asked for clarification on his economic policy, added, “Look, I’m really rich.”"

Living was against all odds, as prospects for basic health and meaningful opportunity were grim. Any graph measuring India’s economic progress since then will show a drastic growth curve. However this curve tells an incomplete story. The promise of growth hasn’t been realized by improvements in many health outcomes. Nearly 70 years later, millions of India’s children continue to face the same dire circumstances my father did.

The economic changes are mirrored by vastly changing demographics. India is set to surpass China to become the world’s most populous country as early as 2022. Soon, for the first time in history, a majority of people in India will be living in cities. India’s public health system, already fractured by resource constraints, will struggle to bear the added weight. Politicians would be wise to view these demographic trends as even more reason to prioritize the health of their citizens, particularly children.

The timing is opportune. According to recent data released by the World Health Organization, India has some of the worst public health indicators in the world. It is home to a majority of the world’s most polluted cities, and Delhi, which tops the list, has levels of air pollution six times higher than levels considered safe. More resonant than the numbers, though, is the image of India’s urban-dwelling children choking on the exhaust of economic growth. And recently leaked data show that India has the highest rates of underweight children in the world and trails its neighboring countries in terms of infant mortality and child immunization rates.

In his Sept. 25 address to the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit — a talk that noticeably eschewed the topic of health — Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “There is no cause greater than shaping a world, in which every life that enters it can look to a future of security, opportunity and dignity.” It is exactly for this reason that Modi should prioritize the health of his people."

The global protests even forced the Chinese Foreign Ministry to address the allegations in press conference with reporters on July 6. “Uighur is one of the 56 ethnic minorities in China. More than 10 million Uighur Turks are living happily and peacefully,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing, denying the ban. “These people have the freedom of religion under the Chinese Constitution.” There is little independent reporting from Xinjiang, but China routinely denies allegations of religious persecution against its Uighur population. The ruling Communist Party is officially atheist, and therefore some implicit bias is to be expected. But it is erroneous to conclude that the Uighur crisis is solely religious. The Uighur nationalists’ desire for more autonomy has long been at odds with China’s centralization policy. If anything, Chinese authorities are using the “war on terrorism” as a cover to demolish the Uighur people’s nationalist aspirations.

A struggle for autonomy

The Uighur struggle for self-rule arguably dates back to the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty conquered the Xinjiang province and incorporated it into China. Uighur nationalists organized several uprisings against the dynasty, which ruled China until the early 20th century. In 1949, Mao Zedong’s forces thwarted Uighur aspirations by imposing total control over Xinjiang, setting off the protracted tensions that have characterized the Uighur-state relations to date. The Chinese government often blames violent episodes in the troubled province on Uighur separatists, attributing at least 200 violent incidents, including bombings and assassinations, to them from 1990 to 2001. But the violence and Uighur demonstrations have decreased since the late 1990s. Tensions escalated again in 2008, when a military police unit in Kashgar in western China was attacked during the Beijing Summer Olympics. The government blamed the Uighurs for the attack. Members of the Uighur diaspora contend that the Chinese government is committing genocide against their people. For example, the U.S.-based Uighur Human Rights Project, which advocates for human rights in East Turkestan, says close to 700 Uighurs were killed from 2013 to 2014. “Although these numbers should not be considered definitive … they are indicative of deterioration in security conditions since Xi Jinping became Chinese president,” the organization said earlier this year. In addition to the routine scapegoating for violence, the Uighur people have had their civil rights seriously compromised. Last year Georgetown University professor James Millward wrote that most state institutions in Xinjiang allegedly require Han ethnicity as a condition for employment. He added that the state interferes in the Uighur community’s cultural practices — for example through teaching only Mandarin in schools and restrictions on weddings, funerals and pilgrimage, or hajj.

The Muslim character of the conflict in Xinjiang is but one aspect of the Uighur people’s long struggle for freedom and autonomy.

Out of China’s 20 million Muslims, Uighurs account for approximately 6 million. Muslims in China are spread across the country, with most of them living outside Xinjiang and majority of them being Hui, who are closely related to the Han, who make up the majority of the Chinese people. But the state has been far more tolerant of the Hui than of the Uighur population. “It seems clear that Hui Muslims have been granted so much more latitude because almost none have challenged secular authorities,” writes Gardner Bovingdon in his 2010 book, “The Uyghurs.” In fact, according to him, in Ningxia province a Sufi sect of Islam was even allowed to establish a “virtual religious state,” with several mosques and hundreds of thousands of followers. So much latitude, he says, that the leader or the movement openly proclaims listening to Osama bin Laden and meeting several “fundamentalist clerics” in Pakistan. In his book “The Thistle and the Drone,” American University professor Akbar Ahmed recounts a conversations he had with a Hui Muslim named Emma, who spoke positively of the Chinese state, telling him, “Chinese Muslim minorities have the same rights and obligations as the other Chinese … They can be Chinese and be Muslims as well.” According to Ahmed, Emma said that she visited mosques and met with imams in northwestern China and that most local Muslim leaders and mosque committee members spoke highly of their relationship with the state. He concludes that “too many of them [Uighurs] are seen as urchins and thieves” and “relatively backward in economic and educational condition, which will be a problem in the long run.” Emma told Ahmed that she believed “[the Uighur people] were different from the Hui,” citing their desire for independence.

I had just fooled around with an acquaintance of mine, and my period was a few days late. Though there was no real penetration and fertilization was practically impossible, I convinced myself that I was carrying a fetus and that my life was over.

I took a pregnancy test. It came back negative, but I was still terrified. What if it was wrong? What if I had taken it too early? I frantically scoured the Internet for information. I was just a few months shy of my 18th birthday and learned that the law required my parents’ consent for an abortion. I knew I would never carry out a pregnancy at such a young age and that my conservative, immigrant parents would never agree to the procedure, so I considered my choices, which included traveling to a state without parental consent laws or asking my friend’s mom to take me to the clinic and pose as my own mother. On top of it all, I worried about the cost. I was hysterical — until I finally got my period.

This experience demonstrates how abysmal my sex education was. The overarching message that girls received in my high school health class was that if we had sex, we were going to get knocked up. Our school’s teen pregnancy rate was very high — we had a daycare full of students’ babies — so it seemed quite plausible to me. (My own vagina was also enigmatic to me. It wasn’t until I was in my twenties that I fully understood the components of my genital region, that I learned I urinated out of my urethra and not my vagina.)

What I needed was information and support, but I didn’t know where to turn. Unfortunately, our education system has not improved much since I was a teenager. Sex education continues to be under attack in the United States despite the overwhelming amount of evidence that a comprehensive curriculum can save young people’s lives. Teaching children about the importance of using condoms and getting tested for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, can keep them from making detrimental choices. Experts estimate that one person age 15 to 24 in the U.S. is infected with HIV every hour of every day. But while some developing countries such as Guatemala and Indonesia are taking important steps to improve their sex-education programs, our country keeps gutting them indiscriminately.

According to a new report from the Guttmacher Institute, only 22 states and the District of Columbia require that public schools teach sex education. Additionally, parents are allowed to opt their children out of sex education programs in 35 states and in D.C., while three states require parents to consent in order for their children to participate in such programs."

With recent campus demonstrations against alleged racial discrimination and in favor of free college tuition, America may be facing a wave of student protest to a degree not seen since the 1960s. While the media focus on college campuses, very few journalists are acknowledging the activism that has been occurring at the high school level. Just in the past year, high school students across the country have protested against racist police brutality, curriculum changes, budget cuts, the expansion of charter schools, standardized tests and other youth-related issues.

After the white police officers responsible for the 2014 deaths of unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner were not indicted, high school students across the country organized solidarity protests in Seattle; New York; Denver; Oakland, California; Minneapolis and Boston. In February, about 250 high school students in Santa Fe, New Mexico left school to protest constant testing and the state’s new mandated exam. In June, Milwaukee high school students walked out of class to protest against the county executive takeover of low-performing schools. And this fall, high school students in Allentown, Pennsylvania, organized a district-wide student walkout demanding the resignation of the superintendent, the inclusion of a student representative on the school board and summer youth employment opportunities. There were also student walkouts in Chicago; Berkeley, California and Philadelphia that occurred this fall.

High school activism is not limited to disruptive activities. Numerous youth organizations operate around the country to tackle issues concerning school closures, at-risk youth and the school-to-prison pipeline, among others.

It would be naive to assume that every student involved in these protests understands and cares about the issues, but it would be equally naive to argue that they are puppets serving adults’ ulterior motives. Too often, authority figures refuse to give youth activism respect because they assume that children cannot think for themselves. Even more pernicious, authority figures often belittle children’s grievances by arguing that youth activism is the work of outside agitators or claiming that students protest simply to skip school.

Considering the constant labeling of today’s youth as narcissistic and obsessed with their digital devices, it is disappointing that most adults do not appreciate youth activism. As long as the cultural belief that “children should be seen, not heard” continues, students’ voices will remain absent from discussions about school policies.

This recent wave of activism in high schools is not without precedent. Indeed, it is reminiscent of the often forgotten 1960s and 1970s high school student movement. With the exception of the 1968 East Los Angeles blowouts, a series of walkouts conducted by Chicano high school students, high school activism from this era has faded from public memory.

This is unfortunate, because high school activism has taken place in almost every major U.S. city, as well as in some suburban and rural areas. It has occurred in public, private, parochial and boarding schools. In 1969, the National Association of Secondary School Principals surveyed more than 1,000 public and private school principals about social unrest in secondary schools. The survey revealed that 56 percent of junior high schools and 59 percent of high schools reported disturbances."

It’s a dramatic show of confidence, and a sharp contrast to the Chinese economy’s rocky summer in which stock markets took the steepest plunges since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Shanghai composite index has fallen 38 percent since June, prompting government intervention through a barrage of restrictive measures intended to pump the prices back up. Beyond its international ramifications, the latest stock market rout was yet another reminder of how much the economy affects the image and stature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders.

The CCP has long used seeking profit for the middle class as an excuse for putting economic opportunism above democratic reform. The effect of the financial downturn on the citizens wallets and savings is likely to challenge the CCP’s narrative and grip on power. A staggering 80 percent of urban Chinese have invested in some sort of equity, putting around 30 percent of their money into stocks, according to Credit Suisse, a leading global financial services company. And this is taking place as China’s tries to bounce back from the slowest growth rate since 1990. After hitting a record 10.4 percent growth in 2010, China’s economic progress has decelerated by around 30 percent over the past five years. This will create financial pressure for anyone in China looking for a stable middle class lifestyle, not just for those who own stocks.

Among other protective measures, the CCP has stepped in once more to discourage shareholders from selling their stakes in anticipation of another crash. Chinese regulators and several government agencies have teamed up to monitor investor behavior so much so that individuals owning more than 5 percent of shares in a company are prohibited from selling.

To be sure, this is not unique to China. Regulators around the world often investigate hedge fund managers and investors to detect or eradicate illegal activities such as insider trading. But China has opted for a more direct route, allowing state agents to intervene in ways that influence and alter the course of the economy. Since June, officers from China’s Ministry of Public Security have partnered with federal regulators to examine the transaction records of large investment and brokerage firms in Shanghai and Beijing in an effort to reduce the stock markets’ volatility. Many managers have been told to stop selling shares, while others have been jailed for unspecified financial crimes. Moreover, the CCP has directed brokerage firms and other financial entities across China to buy up billions of dollars worth of shares, while also warning the news media not to publish stories that may discourage domestic or foreign investment."

Instead, they lent me books and checked on me in my dorm room when I didn’t come to class. They let me read Vonnegut in physics if I really needed to. They renewed my scholarship. They kept inviting me to things, even if I was sullen or withdrawn, and they never, ever forced me to do anything.

I was difficult that year. Like all teenagers, I was not yet fully formed, so my anger was strange and unpredictable — inchoate, inarticulate. I didn’t go to class much. I read voraciously, but rarely the books I had been assigned. I read “Slaughterhouse Five” in the middle of a science class one week. At one point, someone told me my GPA was 1.9. I don’t think I ever checked it myself. My dad and my adviser, Dr. Black, spent hours in worried phone meetings wondering if I would ever turn in my junior term paper.

So I got on an airplane and went home to my high school. Not to Chicago, where my family was — where my dead mother was — but to Chatham Hall, a prep school in Virginia that had given me a scholarship the previous year. In retrospect, it seems like such a strange thing to have done. But my first instinct was to fly to school first, then on to Chicago the next day. My best friend met me at the airport and we went together, back to our strange little school community in the middle of nowhere. Susu, the school chaplain, met us on the front steps and embraced me. Her parents died when she was a teenager, too, she told me.

On the last morning of my visit, the phone rang in the kitchen; I was in another room. A few minutes later, Mila’s mom came in and handed me the phone. She was holding her mouth like people hold their hands when they’re suddenly self-conscious and don’t know what to do with them. On the phone, my father’s voice cracked. My father, it’s worth noting, is given to burying the lede; he once spent 15 minutes telling me about the music at my great-uncle’s funeral mass before admitting that the real reason he was calling was that my little sister was in the ICU. But all I remember him saying, without introduction or embellishment, was this: “Your mom died.”

I’ve been thinking about the year I was 16 a lot this week. Eighteen years ago this weekend, a school friend and I went to Long Island to visit her family for fall break. I don’t remember much about the trip except that the fall leaves were geranium-red and the sky was blue and the sound was cold. It was my first visit to the Northeast.

Earlier this week, a 16-year-old black girl was brutally assaulted by a cop in her South Carolina classroom after she refused to comply with orders to surrender her cellphone and leave the room. She suffered multiple arm and back injuries as a result of the altercation. It has since been reported that she was recently estranged from her mother, uprooted and placed in the foster care system.

The academic dean at the time was Claudia Emerson, a poet who would later receive a Pulitzer Prize for her own meditations on loss in “Late Wife.” Claudia, bless her, devised a plan to prevent me from failing Spanish by — well, no. You know what? I failed Spanish because I preferred to go talk to her. But she did arrange for me to take a Spanish class at a community college in the Chicago suburbs that summer, and for my grade in that class to magically appear on my Chatham transcript so that no one would ever know I had failed Spanish. So I could reinvent myself later as a good student, the kind of student who would not fail Spanish.

My high school was a safe place. Safe when I was difficult, safe when I was sullen. A place to think, to ask questions, to reinvent and regrow as I mourned.

I can’t stop thinking about the 16-year-old girl in South Carolina. You’ve probably seen a tiny cell phone video of her as a man twice her size looms over her, grabs her by the neck, flips her over the chair, and drags her across the classroom. When I watch this video, my whole body tenses as that man stalks toward her. I hope yours does, too.

I recognize that slouch in the cramped desk, those closed shoulders. Sullen, withdrawn, maybe looking at her phone. Her high school is not a safe place for her to think or ask questions or mourn an estrangement. Half a second after that flash of recognition, the policeman is bearing down on her neck.

For years after my mom died, I struggled with hyper-vigilance. The persistent expectation that something was about to go terribly wrong was embedded in my very muscles and nerves and peripheral vision. I was perpetually raw, scanning the horizon for the next disaster. I would jump at shadows at the corners of my vision, convinced that someone or something was bearing down on me. I’m still easily startled when people approach me from behind or touch me unexpectedly.

In the midst of my privileged mourning, I chafed at how authority figures treated me like a victim in the first months after my mother died. But no one ever took my sullen silence as license to victimize me. No one ever bore down on me. Here is white privilege again: that even my most aggressive moments raging against the machine at 16 were framed (rather to my frustration) as part of a sad story in which I was a victim, not a threat.



Conversely, even the calm silence of the black student in the video in the moments before she is assaulted is construed as aggression. My teenage sullenness was called grief by teachers even when it wasn’t. Her grief is willfully ignored — and, when it cannot be ignored, stamped on with brutality and violence.

I am not black. The mere assertion that my life matters does not start any national debates. I have lived in a world where not only my life, but most of my thoughts and feelings, were assumed on their face to matter. When my world was upended, the adults in my classrooms did everything they could to make me feel safe.

So I try to imagine myself sitting in that classroom reading Vonnegut 18 years ago, ignoring my teacher. I imagine something emerging on the horizon of my vision, grasping my neck and slamming me into the ground during that, the most vulnerable year of my life. The world would have tilted disastrously."

By then, nearly 100 other Americans had already lost their lives at the hands of police since the beginning of the year.

But Kassick’s case departs from what has become a tragically common narrative. For starters, the cop who shot him was charged with criminal homicide — a rarity in such scenarios.

Even rarer is that the officer accused of firing two bullets into his back while he was lying facedown on the ground is a woman. She is one of only two female cops ever to face a murder charge in the U.S. for killing a suspect while on duty, according to available data and independent research.

The chances of getting shot by a female cop are slim, and it’s not just because there are so few women in police departments. Data show that female cops discharge their firearms at rates far below their male counterparts, face significantly fewer civilian complaints and are less likely than men to resort to unnecessary physical force when arresting someone.

The evidence is not just statistical. As a veteran female officer explained recently, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid damaging relationships with her colleagues, “I’ve never been in a fight on my own, because I never had to. I’ve only been in fights instigated by my male counterparts.”

Studies also show that female police officers are more inclined to view their job as a public service than men do and are better at communication, de-escalation and trust building — all hallmarks of community policing.

“All the things people are saying they want in their police forces, women are already naturally good at,” said Penny Harrington, a former police chief of Portland, Oregon, and a co-founder of the National Center for Women and Policing (NCWP), in a phone interview this week.

Law enforcement is one of the least gender diverse of any public-sector profession, with male officers accounting for more than 88 percent of the nation’s municipal police forces. Discussions of diversity in policing have focused almost exclusively on hiring more minority officers — which, for all its potential benefits, has been shown to have a negligible impact on levels of excessive force.

If we’re serious about curbing police violence, a good place to start would be to increase the recruitment and promotion of female cops. Unfortunately, the last concerted effort to reduce gender disparities in policing fizzled out in the absence of sustained political pressure.

For most of America’s history, the policing profession was almost exclusively white and male. In 1970 women accounted for less than 2 percent of sworn officers, with most relegated to gender-specific units or clerical positions. That began to change in 1972, when the Supreme Court expanded Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to the public sector, holding police departments accountable for hiring discrimination for the first time."

It was the first direct electoral defeat for the leftist coca grower union leader since he first won the presidency in 2005.

The vote was 51 percent to 49 percent against the ballot question, with 99.5 percent of the ballots counted, a margin of just over 150,000 votes, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal reported. The outcome of Sunday's referendum also blocks Vice President Alvaro Garcia from running again.

Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, helped lift millions out of poverty by more equitably distributing natural gas revenues, spurring the creation of an indigenous middle class.

However, his governing Movement Toward Socialism party has been buffeted by scandal. The vote closely followed a revelation that Morales may have been personally involved in influence-peddling.

And Bolivians have been losing patience with his now-entrenched Movement Toward Socialism.

The vote also closely followed a revelation that Morales may have been personally involved in influence-peddling.

""Evo's traditional opposition among the affluent and middle class was joined by a wide swath of voters who have long been a part of his political support,"" said Jim Shultz, executive director of the left-leaning Democracy Center political advocacy group.

""Their turnaround isn't about moving rightward,"" but rather a rejection of corruption that reflects a belief ""that 20 years is too long for one person to be president,"" he added.

Until Sunday's ballot, Morales had won nationwide elections, including a 2009 rewrite of the constitution, with an average 61.5 percent of the vote.

The referendum's margin of defeat coincided almost exactly with two unofficial ""quick count"" samples announced Sunday by polling firms.

The results showed allegations of vote fraud by some members of the opposition to be unfounded, said Jose Luis Exeni, a member of the electoral tribunal.

The vote count had been unusually slow and Vice President Alvaro Garcia said earlier Tuesday that the outcome would be a ""cliff-hanger.""

He claimed a right-wing conspiracy was ""trying to make disappear by sleight of hand the rural vote that favors Morales."" Garcia provided no evidence to back the claim.

Organization of American States observers reported no evidence of fraud, and the OAS delegation's leader, former Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez, left Bolivia on Tuesday.

President Barack Obama has made similar pledges in the past. However, immigration reform has remained at a standstill during his administration.

Congress’ failure to pass immigration reform and thereby create a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants has led to a variety of piecemeal reforms, mostly outside of the legislative process.

In 2012 Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which granted work permits and temporary relief from deportation for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors. In November 2014, Obama signed an executive action, which established deportation priorities and sought to expand DACA to the parents of children brought to the United States as minors.

But even these limited efforts have faced stiff resistance. Earlier this year, a federal court issued a temporary injunction on Obama’s program. In a move more favorable to migrants, another federal court has recently ruled that the administration’s policy of detaining migrant families is untenable.

About 300 U.S. cities and counties have refused to comply with requests to detain people on immigration charges. However, on July 23, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act, which aims to block federal funding for these localities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement laws. (Obama has vowed to veto this law if it makes it through Congress.)

Despite his administration’s failure to shepherd comprehensive immigration reform through Congress, Obama’s executive action has provided temporary deportation relief for a select group of undocumented migrants. The president’s executive action created a priority enforcement program, which according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a think tank in Washington, “targets enforcement to noncitizens who have been convicted of serious crimes, are threats to public safety, are recent illegal entrants, or have violated recent deportation orders.” The program offers “a degree of protection” from deportation to 87 percent of undocumented immigrants living in the United States, according to the MPI report. In other words, if an undocumented immigrant is apprehended but does not fall into a priority category, he or she is unlikely to be held for a subsequent deportation.

There are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States who continue to live in a state of fear and vulnerability. Many of these individuals have lived as second-class members of our society for decades. That a vast majority of them are no longer an enforcement priority may bring a temporary respite, but these priorities could change at anytime with a stroke of the bureaucratic pen."

This new relationship between the administrative class of the UW system and the ruling Republican Party has eroded whatever remaining distance there was between state government and state universities, turning the university into an agent of the Republicans.

Before Walker came along, there was a clear wall between the politics of the ruling party and the people appointed to serve the interests of university students and faculty. But under Walker’s watch, the state government began to interfere. He has stacked the board of regents, which governs the university system, with lawyers and businesspeople eager to do his will. The regents appointed fellow Republican Raymond W. Cross, chancellor of the UW colleges and extension, as system president. Cross, who has never taught or served as an administrator at a research university, quickly appointed as staff advisers two Republican operatives, James Villa and John Yingling. Villa is a former Walker chief of staff and campaign aide; Yingling was a chief of staff for Republican state Sen. Alberta Darling, a co-chair of the legislature’s powerful Joint Finance Committee.

By the time Walker signed into law his third biennial budget on Sunday, he and the Republican-controlled legislature had cut the UW system by over $500 million since 2011. The budget has frozen tuition — thereby preventing budget balancing through more tuition revenue — since 2013. It has also eliminated tenure protections in state law, passing tenure policy to the UW board of regents.

As troubling as these implications are for higher education, it is crucial to be aware of the much greater implications for national politics, should Gov. Scott Walker prevail in the presidential bid that he announced this week. Walker’s authoritarian takeover of the University of Wisconsin system can serve as a preview of how he would govern the country.

The University of Wisconsin system has become ground zero in the Republican war against public higher education. Over the past several months, academics, politicians and journalists have pointed out the implications of the Wisconsin GOP’s draconian cuts to the university system’s budget and its vicious attacks on tenure, academic freedom and shared governance for higher education (public and private) nationwide.

Walker’s party-line authoritarianism was in plain view at an emergency meeting of the University of Wisconsin at Madison faculty senate on June 9, where Blank repeatedly tried to persuade the packed auditorium that faculty should trust her and the board of regents to protect tenure, shared governance and academic freedom. When one senator protested that 16 of the 18 members of the board were the governor’s appointees, Blank placated him by saying the votes would be “subject to senate approval.”

Later that week, news came out that the Wisconsin Senate voted along party lines to approve Walker’s latest nominee, Mike M. Grebe, to the board of regents. He is the son of Michael W. Grebe, a former Walker campaign manager and the president of the conservative Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Blank’s confidence in the goodwill of the UW board of regents was immediately revealed as misplaced trust in authority.

Such blatant political quid pro quo should provide a stark warning to the American public about how power would flow in a Walker presidency. Academic and scientific expertise would be ignored in the face of corporate interests, and anyone who disagreed with him would be silenced or disempowered, just as he has done with labor unions, teachers and public employees in Wisconsin.

But as we were reminded by a recent AP article, the chain of power does not start with Walker. It has its roots in wealthy conservative organizations such as the Bradley Foundation, the various Koch family foundations and the American Legislative Exchange Council, among whose largest funders are billionaire brothers Charles Koch and David Koch. In an article for The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Saul Newton, a student at the UW Waukesha campus, traces the Bradley Foundation’s war on the UW system back more than 20 years, when the foundation’s president at the time, Michael S. Joyce, accused the university of transferring “moral and spiritual authority away from civil society into the hands of the modern, centralized state” and insisted that “our common project must be to hasten the demise of progressivism.” Newton writes that Joyce prescribed doing so “by demolishing public institutions, specifically public education.” Thus it was to nobody’s surprise when Walker named Michael W. Grebe as his presidential campaign manager.

Equally chilling is that this Republican daisy chain extends to the day-to-day operations of the university, with system and campus administrators unafraid to abuse their government-authorized power down to the smallest incident.

I know from experience: Last month two armed, uniformed campus police officers paid me a visit in my office. They wanted to question me about a playful reference on Twitter to “armed insurrection,” which was brought to the attention of my administration by staff of the University of Wisconsin system. The officers suggested that my tweet could be taken as a threat and wanted to know whether I was planning any kind of violent intervention at the board of regents meeting being hosted on my campus later this week. Shockingly, I was not.

Since Walker took office in 2011, his administration has been a laboratory for executive Republican power grabbing. This unbridled power has included the legislature’s passing of Walker’s Act 10 reforms in his first administration, which stripped public employees of their bargaining rights; the recent passage of right to work laws; the evisceration of the state’s world-renowned Department of Natural Resources; and the ongoing destruction of tenure, academic freedom and shared governance. In every case, these political actions have involved reducing checks on executive power by public agencies, universities and especially the citizens of Wisconsin in order to pay back those who have spoken out against the governor and his policies.

We have seen in Wisconsin a preview of what the next stage in the evolution of Republican executive power would be, as Walker and his cronies have carefully coordinated the revision of state law in the service of executive power. Let us hope that American voters aren’t fooled into believing that a Walker presidency would be any different."

When my son woke up crying an hour and a half later, Drew shook me awake. I sat up in bed, dazed. Not yet 72 hours into my new role as mother, fatigue apparently turned me into Teflon.

“I’m drawing a blank,” I admitted.

“You have to feed the baby!” His annoyance teetered on outrage (though we have laughed about this since). The stupor lifted. I got out of bed, scooped our son out of the bassinet and put him to my breast. Drew placed his pillow on my side of the bed to support me as I spent the next hour nursing our newborn. Then, along with the baby I slept for two hours before Drew woke me up again because my child’s cries didn’t.

Funnily enough, the fact that Drew is a light sleeper and I am a heavy one has helped to set the tone for our renegotiation of household duties now that we have a child. Because I am breastfeeding our son, for the past 9 months I have shouldered the bulk of the responsibility for his care, providing nearly all of his sustenance and most of his comfort. Yet, in the middle of the night, when breastfeeding can feel the most isolating (and maddening), Drew more often than not has spent some of that time awake with me, alleviating the sense that I am parenting alone. As our son has gotten older and doesn’t require night feedings as much, Drew often forgoes waking me and rocks our son to sleep.

In her book “Nighttime Breastfeeding: An American Cultural Dilemma,” Johns Hopkins medical anthropologist Cecilia Tomori calls this kind of partner support “men’s kin work.” According to her research, men provide valuable breastfeeding support mainly by creating “new divisions of household labor that better accommodated the needs of the new mother.” In my case, her finding is true. One of Drew's jobs post-baby has been to alert me to our son’s nighttime cries. Additionally, he now does laundry, makes most of our home-cooked meals and always does the dishes. Between caring for my child, work projects and trying desperately to scratch out a little time to read and exercise, dinner and laundry barely make my after-thought list. Drew, like a lot of decent, non-lactating partners in relationships that have produced kids, has picked up some of the household slack. Instead of being “Mr. Mom,” which with a breastfed baby is nearly impossible, Drew, has become “Mr. Wife,” adding some domestic duties to his docket. He will never lactate, but he can load the dishwasher."

But the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership that Congress must soon give a straight up-or-down vote threatens our liberties as Americans and is likely to add almost nothing to U.S. economic growth. I have been a longtime critic of the agreement, especially since WikiLeaks obtained a draft of its intellectual property provisions, showed a clear bias in favor of corporations. Since Washington made the text public in October I have come to see some very real benefits in the agreement — but not nearly enough to warrant making it the law of the land. What I see now is a pact that would make government subservient to corporations, posing a real threat to freedom and self-governance.

Does little on tariffs

There are two chief reasons to reject the TPP. First, the partnership does little for the U.S. on tariffs. In fact, the TPP was only minimally about U.S. tariffs on imports, which overall are insignificant at 1.5 percent, amounting to only a fraction of a penny of each dollar of federal tax revenue. However, the same is not true for exports: Some U.S.-made goods are subject to tariffs of up to 70 percent. Tariffs on U.S. goods imposed by the 11 other countries fall to zero, encouraging more exports of machinery, automotive parts and other manufactured products. But these issues could be resolved in bilateral negotiations without expanding corporate powers. Second, the agreement would allow foreign corporations and governments to challenge federal, state and local laws in every other partnership country. The arbitration panels will likely to be composed of trade lawyers agreed to by each side. Despite some precedents in existing treaties, this raises fundamental questions of sovereignty, especially since corporate agent­s, not judges in courts of law, would make decisions binding on the body politic. That no case brought against the United States under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), for example, has resulted in damages should not blind us to the fact that huge damages could be awarded under the TPP. The TPP would create a system of arbitration run by insiders, who could be advocates one day, arbiters the next, an arrangement almost guaranteed to produce corrupt backscratching for the benefit of corporations and at the expense of we the people. Worse, no matter how economically damaging, unfair or just plain wrong the decisions of TPP arbitration panels, the rulings will not be subject to review by any court. This is justice of, by and for corporations, which means it cannot be justice. You could even pay more taxes to cover damages awarded by these unaccountable arbitration panels. More than $400 million in damages have been paid and $14 billion is sought under trade agreements already in effect.

Minimal gains

Supporters of the pact try to divert the public from these issues with promises of big economic gains that imply more jobs. Take the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which is sponsored by Wall Street mogul Peter Peterson. News reports last week cited a Peterson estimate that if the agreement were approved, American exports in 2030 would grow by an extra 9.1 percent, or $357 billion, in 2030.

For people to remain free and governments to remain sovereign, corporations must remain subject to state control, not the other way around.

That sounds terrific. The problem is in a related fact all the news reporters missed because they read the press release, not the actual study. The report predicts that imports will rise by the exact same $357 billion as exports, making the net result a big fat zero, as economist Dean Baker pointed out in his invaluable Beat The Press blog. Actual results will be not much better than zero, at least for America, the World Bank estimates. It projects the American economy in 2030 will be larger by an extra four-tenths of one percent. That’s roughly equal to the economy of metropolitan Oklahoma City. Australia, Canada, Chile and Mexico would see growth increase by a fraction of one percent to about 2 percent. On the other hand, the World Bank expects Vietnam’s economy to surge by an extra 10 percent and Malaysia about 8 percent. Some countries that are not part of the pact, such as Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines, can expect their economies to shrink, the World Bank predicted. That could lead to social upheaval. It also raises questions about China, which is not part of the pact and which has become increasingly bellicose under President Xi Jinping. Would Beijing react to the pact by creating its own economic trading zones, by disrupting the deal, by reviving the communist party’s xenophobia or becoming even more aggressive in the South China Sea? In the U.S., advocates have failed to make the case that the pact will reduce our huge trade imbalances. Existing trade rules enable people to buy goods cheaply, especially Chinese goods, but at a terrible cost of lost manufacturing jobs and steadily draining American assets. If past experience is any guide, that will only continue with new agreements. NAFTA and our bilateral deals with China and South Korea have resulted in their exports to America growing much faster than our exports to them — a boon to foreign workers at the expense of American workers, especially in manufacturing. Global capitalists are indifferent to these imbalances because they benefit no matter how individual countries fare. For each dollar of goods we sent to China last year they sent us more than $4 of goods; the trade imbalance ran close to $1 billion per day. With Seoul the ratio is less, about $1.60 to $1, with an annual trade imbalance of $26 billion. America has done better in services — accounting, banking, information technology, law — but those represent a minority of total trade.

They are protesting the appointment of an actor, Gajendra Chauhan, whom they see as grossly unqualified, as the chairman of the institution. What might appear to be an issue affecting only the school’s students has become the subject of a raging national debate, in part because of the influence that cinema wields on the Indian psyche. But more important, it demonstrates a larger pattern of troubling intrusion into educational and cultural affairs by the government formed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The FTII is one of numerous institutions of higher learning funded by the government. Other premier institutes cover technology, management, medicine, architecture and statistics, among others. In his book “The World Is Flat,” New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman writes that the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) “were one of the best bargains America ever had,” since 1 in 4 IIT grads settle in the United States. FTII graduates pervade the Hindi film industry and are among its best technicians. The school has a rather misleading reputation as an artsy space in which learning is second to pretentious politics. FTII graduates have gone on to direct critically acclaimed and commercially successful Indian movies. One of Bollywood’s most successful filmmakers in recent years, Rajkumar Hirani, whose latest movie, the satirical “PK,” is India’s highest-grossing hit of all time, is a graduate. Filmmakers who have lectured there include Academy Award recipients Satyajit Ray (director of the “Apu” trilogy) and David Lean (director of “Lawrence of Arabia” and “The Bridge on the River Kwai”), and among its alumni are some of India’s finest actors — Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi.

In this context, Chauhan, the government’s pick for chairman, appears extremely ill suited. The Indian media haven’t tired of pillorying his body of work, which includes films such as “Jungle Love,” “Vasna” (“Desire”), “Jungle Ka Beta” (“The Son of the Jungle”) and various other B-grade — semipornographic or forgettable — movies. His main qualification appears to be his affiliation with the party in power; he was the BJP national convener for culture, responsible for promoting “the party’s ideology through cultural activities,” as he put it in an interview with The Indian Express.

Equally worrisome is the selection of other FTII officials. (The FTII’s governing council is elected from the ranks of its society members and, according to its website, “is responsible for making all major policy decisions of the institute.”) One society member, Shailesh Gupta, is an FTII graduate who made an over-the-top propaganda film in support of Modi before his election. Another society member, Anagha Ghaisas, apparently doesn’t know the difference between fiction and documentary, according to a 2014 court order regarding a disputed payment."

Last year, sales of organic products topped $39 billion.

That’s the good news. The bad news is that most natural food companies steer clear of political battles that can have a significant effect on their business model.

Here’s how Politico reporter Helena Bottemiller Evich recently described the problem:

There is virtually no ‘good food’ industry lobbying strategy in place, as the vanguards of healthier eating have largely ignored Capitol Hill, leaving the traditional food and beverage powerhouses — which spent more than $36 million last year on lobbying — to push their agenda … The gap between the growth in the market and who’s playing ball in D.C. could be a challenge for the greater food movement and segments of the industry that could benefit from certain federal policy reforms.

In other words, the growing organic and natural food industry cannot keep relying solely on the marketplace for their success.

The conventional food industry has had a decades-long head start in D.C. — and knows far too well how to play the game. The Grocery Manufacturers Association was formed more than a century ago, and in recent years has been leading the (largely successful) opposition to the labeling of foods containing genetically engineered ingredients — a key issue for the organic foods sector.

The pesticide and biotech trade group CropLife America, whose original name was “The Agricultural Insecticide and Fungicide Association,” has been undermining organic agriculture since 1933.

Numerous other junk-food companies and trade groups are filling the void left by the good-food sector. There are notable exceptions to the gap, such as the Organic Trade Association, along with a smattering of companies joining non-profit organizations in the GMO-labeling fight. But more firepower is needed.

For example, the natural food industry could focus on stopping “The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act,” an ironically named bill that has already passed the House, from moving through the Senate. The legislation would not only prevent states from requiring the labeling of GMO foods, but also mandate a federal definition of the word “natural” — a problem that has plagued the industry for years. Given that the junk-food industry is pushing the bill, it’s likely that such a definition will water down the term and allow, for example, foods containing genetically engineered ingredients to be labeled “natural.”

There are other issues in which the organic- and natural-food industry should get engaged. Congress continues to debate improvements to school nutrition guidelines that should be a no-brainer, such as requiring a half-cup of vegetables. The federally subsidized lunch program feeds some 31 million children (PDF) every single day — a huge potential market. While most organic and natural foods are priced too high for penny-pinching schools, the sector could join the fight for higher government-reimbursement rates. Moreover, without the natural-food sector, the only voices being heard are the pizza and the junk-food lobbies."

A fresh round of sectarian violence could put progress on a Syrian deal on hold for months to come.

Even when negotiations on Syria resume, they will at best be the start of a complicated, slow process that could take months or years.

But there is something the United States can do right now to help Syrian civilians: It can press Turkey to allow human rights advocates and refugees seeking protection to cross the border from Syria. President Barack Obama got one thing dangerously wrong in his Dec. 7 televised national address when he billed the border closure as an achievement in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In fact, it’s the opposite.

Listening to Syrian human rights activists in the Turkish border city of Gaziantep, it seems the closure doesn’t deter ISIL from crossing in and out of Syria. Rather, it prevents civil society activists from doing their vital work in the fight against ISIL and against the repression of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. To the limited extent that international attention has been paid to the danger of Turkey’s border closure, it has focused on the very real harm to refugees trying to flee Syria. Even less discussed is the threat to Syrians trying to support civil society in their country.

Gaziantep has become a hub for such activists, who are running dozens of programs in Syria that promote good local governance, expose corruption and fight sectarianism. In other words, they’re trying to prevent exactly the sort of grievances that ISIL feeds on. Activists can dissuade potential recruits from joining ISIL — if they can reach them. If civil society leaders are prevented from offering people a credible alternative for a brighter future, ISIL wins.

The effective closure of legal crossings since last July for all but humanitarian emergencies and a few other exceptions is strangling the work of these activists. Very few can cross through the legal checkpoints, and it can take weeks to get permission to get on the humanitarian list approved for crossing."

“You all have to come now,” it read, warning that two City Council members, backed by Mayor Betsy Hodges, introduced a last-minute budget proposal for $605,000 to fortify the station, in the northern part of the city, calling for shatterproof windows and a higher fence around the building in the aftermath of the occupation, all so that the officers could feel safe.

But what about the community where the officers operate with impunity? At the occupation of the 4th Precinct station, the police defaulted to militarized tactics. Officers armed with pepper spray, rubber bullets and batons attacked grieving and peaceful community members, including elected officials and their relatives. One high school student suffered a concussion when the police beat her and dragged her by her hijab. After white supremacist vigilantes shot five black community members, the police took 15 minutes to respond to the scene, less than a block from their headquarters, then pepper-sprayed people helping the victims. Since the occupation ended, many community members have reported police retaliation for their involvement in the protests.

All this state-sponsored violence was funded by taxpayers.

And then some city officials, in a move that demonstrates how out of touch they are, announced plans to reward the police for their punitive law enforcement tactics with a new pot of public money. Dozens of community members flocked to the council chambers to oppose the funding and called for major police reform in Minneapolis, forcing the council to nix the proposal.

It was a modest win for community residents demanding change — which could serve as a blueprint for what transformative justice looks like beyond the police and their use of force.

American taxpayers spend $126 billion a year to fund police departments nationwide. Yet throughout the country, black people are underprotected and overpoliced. North Minneapolis is no exception. The protests at the 4th Precinct station were sparked by the fatal police shooting of Jamal Clark — the final straw in a year that saw unprecedented levels of mistrust between underresourced communities and the police.

While the protests put this tension on display for the world to see, North Minneapolis residents experience aggression by the police every day. An American Civil Liberties Union report in May demonstrated what many in the community already know: that black people in Minneapolis are nine times more likely to be arrested for low-level offenses as white people are.

Meanwhile, African-Americans in the Twin Cities region are more than three times as likely as whites to be unemployed. Nationally, black Americans are twice as likely as whites to be unemployed."

Cao often finds himself waiting alone on the side of Chef Menteur Highway, a road that stretches out into the industrial emptiness of Eastern New Orleans. Cao, who is Vietnamese, lives in Village de L'Est, a small suburban enclave in East New Orleans known for its large Vietnamese community.

A bus passes the station. “No, that’s out of service. They play you when they do that,” Cao joked. “All the tourists that come here, you know the first thing that they go on is the streetcar, and they are like ‘Oh, public transportation must be good,’” Cao said, arching an eyebrow and twisting his lips into a cynical half-smile. “I am like, ‘No, just ‘cause the streetcar comes every five to 10 minute for you, does not mean [public transportation] is good.’”

Before Hurricane Katrina, there were several buses connecting Village de L’Est with the city, but now, a decade later, there is only this one.

“I know exactly why they fix the streetcar,” Cao said. “‘Cause they make the most money off of it. The tourists go there.” The sun begins to set, and the highway darkens slowly from east to west, as the bus arrives 30 minutes late. Cao is gender fluid; he said that on the bus he sticks out as “a minority within the minorities.” When he dresses femininely in bright heels and knee-length cotton skirts, Cao keeps music blaring in his headphones and tries not to make eye contact with anyone. After being robbed, harassed, and propositioned while waiting for and riding the bus, Cao now carries a pink, spiked, hard plastic knuckle so he can defend himself."

The scenario has played out in Custer County and elsewhere in western Oklahoma at least three times in recent years. This is the third in a three-part series exploring the case of Mah-hi-vist Goodblanket, an 18-year-old member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, shot by sheriff's deputies after his father called 911. See also parts one and two .

The Black Kettle National Grassland is a vast expanse of red earth topped with wind-whipped prairie grasses in western Oklahoma. A walking path there features an audio tour, in which a computerized voice calmly details how the U.S. Cavalry, led by Gen. George Armstrong Custer, surprised and then slaughtered a peaceful band of sleeping Cheyenne on November night in 1868, killing men, women and children.

He then took prisoners and ordered the gruesome slaughter of 875 of the horses at the encampment near the Washita River and the present-day city of Cheyenne.

Today, 60 miles east in Custer County — named for the officer — the battles fought in the local Native American community are still fierce and deadly. Poverty, mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse are huge problems in Oklahoma, home to 39 federally recognized tribes.

“The alcoholism and drug addiction rates are staggering in the Native American population. It’s staggering,” said Rosemary Stephens, the editor and chief of The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribune, based at tribal headquarters in tiny Concho, west of Oklahoma City.

Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal lands are scattered throughout Custer County and elsewhere in western Oklahoma.

The killing of two Native Americans by law enforcement has fed racial tension in the majority-white law enforcement forces and minority Native population, she said.

“Custer County,” said Stephens, “is our Ferguson.”

In Custer County, law officers killed two mentally ill Native Americans in separate incidents in 2012 and 2013. Unlike with the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in August 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, marches, commentary and a cohesive call for change hasn’t followed the deadly force incidents in rural America.

Benjamin Whiteshield was in the midst of a paranoid episode on June 27, 2012, and went to the Clinton Police Department for help. He held a wrench to protect himself; he thought he was being followed. A Clinton officer fired a shot, striking him in the mouth and killing him.

Mah-hi-vist Goodblanket’s father, Wilbur Goodblanket, called 911 on Dec. 21, 2013, after his son started thrashing around the home and breaking windows. Mah-hi-vist Goodblanket, 18, had oppositional defiant disorder, a behavioral disorder marked by angry outbursts, trouble controlling temper and other symptoms. He was in the midst of a mental episode when Custer County sheriff’s deputies shot him. The department maintained that he was armed and throwing knives."

Electricity should be cheap in New York because the state’s capacity to generate power far outstrips demand. Its surplus is huge, as much as 63 percent in May, and never less than 4.6 percent, New England Power Coordinating Council reliability reports show. Prices should fall when demand is below capacity. But when capacity falls short of demand by even 1 percent, electricity market prices soar. Demand in New York is falling, primarily because of “a decrease in upstate industrial” electricity use, the Northeast Power Coordinating Council’s latest report shows. Yet instead of enjoying cheaper power, New Yorkers pay 40 percent more than the average for the 48 contiguous states, federal pricing data show. Adjusted for inflation, electricity in New York costs almost 17 percent more than a decade ago (though it is down a bit from last year). So why does capacity-rich New York suffer the fifth most expensive electricity among the 48 states? The answer lies in the Alice in Wonderland rules of the Pubic Service Commission, the regulator; the Independent System Operator, which runs the so-called markets; and the independent power producers.

Publicly available secrets

The regulator, the operator and the producers all agree, at least for the moment, that the electricity market must be veiled in secrecy to protect trade secrets and prevent collusion by the bidders (which would be a crime). Assemblyman James F. Brennan was skeptical and asked to see the data. He was refused, prompting a Public Service Commission inquiry into whether the data should be disclosed. Lawyers, economists and executives for the System Operator and the power companies have told the commission that the data must remain secret or a truly competitive market will not exist. Marc L. Potkin of Entergy, the New Orleans-based electricity company, warned regulators of “the potential harm to the competitive markets” if producers know each other’s costs. Entergy subsidiaries “take extensive steps to protect the confidentiality of this data and have not knowingly released their confidential Information on the internet or through any other avenue,” Potkin told the commission. “Entergy does not publish this data nor does Entergy otherwise provide — or intend to provide — this data to the public.” Potkin also testified that the company keeps the data secret because disclosure “may either confuse, or, worse, mislead” people. Yet that very data on Entergy power plants is all publicly available, much of it published by Entergy. Utility economist Robert McCullough demonstrated this in a 190-page report filed on behalf of Assemblyman Brennan. McCullough devoted six pages to examples of what Potkin told regulators must be kept secret but that Entergy publishes in various places. McCullough then went on for page after page showing how other companies making similar claims either publish the data or how “any reasonably competent analyst” can distil the facts from a host of published reports.

What we see in the New York case is, at its most blatant, how democracy that should serve people is being perverted into government of the corporations, by the corporations and for the corporations.

The Independent Power Producers of New York, the electricity makers’ state trade association, insists that heat rates, which determine the efficiency of each plant, must be held in confidence. Yet Massachusetts publishes the heat rate data for each New York power plant. If McCullough can figure all this out, so can the competing power producers. And if the insiders all know each other’s costs, there is simply no reason for secrecy. The power plant witnesses were careful to not assert that they do not know or cannot figure out the heat rates and other cost factors of their competitors. If they could not, it would suggest gross incompetence and invite litigation by securities lawyers over corporate mismanagement. If I knew, I would tell you what the System Operator and the producers’ trade association think about McCullough revealing that the facts they insist must not be revealed are already disclosed in other places. Unfortunately, neither responded to my emails and calls.

A state-sanctioned cartel

In previous columns back to May 2014 I have documented how Wall Street manipulates the rules, notably in New England’s so-called market, to inflate electricity prices. The New York Independent System Operator rules do something a little different: They help prevent prices from falling. Thus they run against the traditional reasons for antitrust laws, better called the competitive market laws. Professor Robert H. Lande of the University of Baltimore, an antitrust specialist, reminded me that the railroad and other cartels of the late 1800s were not formed to jack up prices, but to keep them from falling. That is exactly what the New York Independent System Operator does through its secrecy and other rules. What New Yorkers now suffer is a state-sanctioned cartel, something far worse than what Congress anticipated when it passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 that made any conspiracy to raise prices a felony. The New York legislature has institutionalized price gouging and made it legal. The case Assemblyman Brennan brought about has now produced the best evidence, in a two decade long history of mounting evidence, that the electricity markets are shams. This case carries huge economic consequences for New York, and yet beyond my own work I cannot find any serious coverage in the news. Brennan’s case also should be considered in light of the huge discounts that New York state government agencies have awarded to industrial customers such as Alcoa and Yahoo. Industrial electricity customers are paying 28 percent less than a decade ago. Alcoa got a 30-year deal worth at least $5.6 billion in below-market electricity rates. For each smelter job Alcoa maintains producing aluminum it gets all of its labor costs paid plus $90,000 per worker each year.

Heightened focus on the nation’s police is long overdue. But it’s also worth noting that the vast majority of defendants who are wronged by the criminal justice system suffer their greatest harm not at the hands of police, but by a system of adjudication riddled with deficiencies. In his new book, “Unfair: The New Science of Criminal Injustice,” Drexel University law professor Adam Benforado explores the nature of these defects — which include wrongful convictions, false confessions and bad verdicts — by focusing on new discoveries in the cognitive sciences. Among other things he highlights recent studies that reveal how acute problems with our trial system are rooted in the subconscious drivers that influence the way individual investigators, witnesses, jurors and even judges make sense of the world around them. This has prompted courts to begin exploring ways of mitigating the impact so-called “implicit biases” on judicial procedures. Understanding the limitations of the human mind — and how judicial practices have learned to exploit them — helps explain the stark disconnect between the American ideal of justice and our ability to properly dispense it. More importantly, it could offer clues into ways of improving our justice process to make it more equitable, impartial and fair.

To err is human

Despite the prominent role eyewitness testimony plays in prosecuting criminal cases, it is widely accepted that human perception is highly malleable, particularly during times of anxiety and stress. In the days following the Ferguson shooting, for instance, a version of the events took shape based on eyewitness statements that included Brown having his hands up in surrender when he was gunned down by Officer Darren Wilson. Yet after interviewing nearly two dozen eyewitnesses who originally made that claim, investigators from the Department of Justice found most of their accounts unreliable because they conflicted with physical and/or forensic evidence, or contradicted earlier statements. This last point suggests that the recollection of some witnesses had actually evolved to fit the dominant narrative. This isn't surprising. As early as the 1970s researchers proved what philosophers and linguists have been arguing over for centuries: What people remember about a particular situation or event is easily influenced by the language others use to describe it. Neuroscientists now say that contrary to earlier theories that viewed memories as static impressions, the mere process of recalling an event can change one’s recollection of it. The consensus among legal experts is that mistaken eyewitness testimony is responsible for more wrongful convictions than any other form of evidence; but since these witnesses are usually convinced of their own version of events, detecting a false memory from a genuine one is nearly impossible without an alternate finding of fact. Criminal investigators can turn these tendencies to their favor, knowingly or not, with something as simple as a strategically placed a photograph or a disapproving facial gesture. Last year — in response to a growing number of exonerations tied to faulty eyewitness testimony — the National Academy of Sciences called for sweeping reforms to improve the reliability of eyewitness testimony, largely by adding safeguards to lessen outside influences on witness testimony. While this is an encouraging step, many of the deficiencies that make humans unreliable witnesses negatively influence other aspects of the judicial process, including some of our most sacred institutions.

‘America's hyper-adversarial trial system not only unfairly favors parties that can afford to assemble the best teams; it deliberately obscures the path to justice.’

At the top of this list is our jury system, which reformers identified decades ago as a source of judicial inequity. And it’s hard to argue against them. During Jim Crow, all-white juries across the South regularly ignored the facts to acquit white defendants accused of crimes against blacks. And as recently as 2014 it was demonstrated that juries are more likely to sentence black defendants to death. Even in apparently ideal circumstances, civilian juries are poorly equipped to impartially navigate conflicting interpretations of law and fact. For example, research shows that two-thirds of jurors don’t understand judges’ instructions even though they say they do. During deliberations, “holdout” jurors who take positions contrary to the majority report being bullied, sometimes successfully, into changing their vote. These issues are even more pronounced when we use civilian juries to decide whether to bring charges against someone. That's because grand juries operate under procedures that unilaterally favor the state, which explains why they so rarely return charges on police officers. There have been periodic calls over the years for the U.S. to follow the lead of nations such as France, Greece, India and South Africa and abandon the use of juries composed entirely of civilians in favor of panels comprised of both citizens and trained jurists. However, this remains a minority position in America — a consequence, no doubt, of our lack of faith in partisan judges (a problem that could be rectified by reforming judicial elections) and the mistaken belief that a right to be tried by a jury of one’s peers is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.

It was nice while it lasted.

I have always admired Hillary Clinton’s ambition. What’s distressing is how far she’s willing to go to fulfill it. As we learned in 2008, Clinton plays nice when an unlikely rival first appears out of nowhere, steadily gaining in popularity and momentum. But as soon as it’s clear that her challenger poses a real threat , she panics and whips off the gloves.

In 2008 she assured “60 Minutes” that then-Sen. Barack Obama was not a Muslim, “ as far as I know .” Many interpreted the qualifying phrase as insinuating that Obama could be a Muslim. Others insisted that members of the media were reading too much into that final clause.

That remark was open to interpretation; other tactics were unambiguously dirty. It was reported in 2008 that Clinton staffers circulated a photo of Obama in African dress to fuel rumors that he was a Muslim. Her campaign’s New Hampshire co-chairman, Bill Shaheen, resigned in 2008 after raising questions about Obama’s teenage drug use, and two Iowa volunteer coordinators resigned after forwarding emails about Obama’s nonexistent Muslim identity. Mark Penn, Clinton’s chief campaign strategist early in her 2008 run, advised the campaign in a 2007 memo to emphasize Obama’s “lack of American roots.” Penn, too, ultimately resigned.

By contrast, the most notable resignation from the Obama campaign was that of Samantha Power, now the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who resigned after calling Clinton a “monster” who would stoop to anything to get elected.

It is possible neither Clinton nor her senior advisers, aside from Penn, knew of or condoned these dirty tactics. But she certainly has a high tolerance for slimy operatives who specialize in sewing doubt and fear. During this year’s campaign, she has accused her top rival, Bernie Sanders, of wanting to “ tear up” the Affordable Care Act and dispatched her daughter to frighten voters with the specter of a Sanders health care plan that would strip low-income people of Medicaid . Both claims are patently false. He favors a single-payer health care system that would extend coverage to all Americans, not take it away. Clinton knows this, and it is disingenuous to say otherwise."
2016-02-24 00:00:00,http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/24/do-different-generations-of-immigrants-think-differently.html,Do Generations of Immigrants Think Differently?,[u'Ned Beauman'],"[u'styles', u'different', u'cow', u'thinking', u'study', u'immigrants', u'hamlets', u'chicken', u'subjects', u'differently', u'tower', u'grass', u'think', u'generations']","Self-enhancement bias is just one of a number of differences in thinking that have been identified so far. Others are even more fundamental, reaching deep into perception and ontology. For instance, imagine a cow, a chicken and some grass. Which of those two go together? People from the U.S. tend to pair the cow and chicken because they’re both farm animals, whereas people from China tend to pair the cow and the grass, because cows eat grass. In the crudest terms, Western thinking can be described as individualistic and analytical, while Asian thinking can be described as collectivistic and relational. (One theory is that this all goes back to the different crops that are cultivated in different parts of the world; rice farming requires a lot more cooperation than wheat farming.)

This understanding of thinking styles was the basis for Mesoudi’s study in Tower Hamlets. “How Do People Become WEIRD?” reports that the second-generation subjects are positioned about halfway between the first-generation subjects and the nonmigrant subjects, particularly with regard to collectivism versus individualism in response to questions such as “Family members should stick together, no matter what sacrifices are required — agree or disagree?”

It’s no great shock to hear that the children of immigrants have, like Abdul Shohid, one foot in each culture. What makes this study important is that this is a mode of assimilation so ineffable that you might never even think to look — and yet now we can put numbers on it. “If these characteristics were hard wired or genetic, then we wouldn’t expect to see any such rapid shift,” Mesoudi said. “Or if they were just parentally taught, then, again, you wouldn’t see that kind of shift. But these results implicate what we call horizontal cultural transmission, meaning things like education and the mass media.”

Does it really make any difference whether your neighbor thinks the cow goes with the grass or with the chicken? There is evidence to suggest that harmony in thinking styles may make at least some contribution to harmony in real life. This field of inquiry is still nascent, but multiple studies have found, for instance, that immigrants who retain Asian thinking styles have briefer and less effective conversations with their doctors — suggesting that the problems that Shohid’s parents had accessing services may have had other causes apart from inexperience and language barriers.

Mesoudi chose the Bangladeshis of Tower Hamlets in part because he believed them to be, he said, “the hardest test case,” given their high concentration and robust culture. Although there is considerable evidence of immigration’s benefits, it’s sometimes suggested by critics of immigration that these benefits will halo some ethnicities much more than others. “Our study, I think, speaks to that point,” he said, “by showing that Muslim British Bangladeshis are no different from other migrant groups in showing rapid acculturation.” Even in the densest Banglatown, assimilation seems to be unstoppable. Regardless of whether a second-generation kid wears a jubba or sweatpants, his thinking is becoming more Western at the most abstract and instinctual levels.

The Jamiatul Ummah School, a private secondary school in Tower Hamlets’ Whitechapel neighborhood, recently failed its third government inspection in a row after inspectors found books in the library that promoted “inequality of women and punishments including stoning to death.” Mesoudi’s prior research involved asking college students in Missouri to imagine themselves in the role of Neanderthal hunters designing flint arrowheads by trial and error — interesting but not all that provocative. Asked whether he was aware when he started the Tower Hamlets study that he was wading into much more turbulent waters, he said, “It was always scientifically driven. We had no political motivation to prove anything or campaign for anything.”"

In addition, many politicians and commentators have called attention to the Confederate flag, a symbol of white supremacy, and demanded that it be removed. Governor Nikki Haley recently called for the flag to be removed from the state capitol.

While such a step would be significant, it would not erase the underlying reality: Non-Hispanic whites living in formerly Confederate states still hold racist views at a higher rate than the rest of the nation.

In a 2013 study, legal scholars Christopher Elmendorf and Douglas Spencer developed a measure to examine racial stereotyping across states by using responses to large surveys that asked respondents to rate how hard-working or intelligent black people are. They find that South Carolina ranked third highest in terms of non-black people expressing anti-black stereotyping and fourth in terms of white people expressing such sentiments. Indeed, using their metric of anti-black stereotyping, five formerly Confederate states (South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana) rank in the top 10 states for racist whites, while Florida and Texas are in the top 15.

These results are unsurprising: Scholars find that racial animosity can linger for centuries. More recently, political scientists Avidit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell and Maya Sen have found that, “Whites who currently live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves in 1860 are more likely to identify as a Republican, oppose affirmative action, and express racial resentment and colder feelings toward blacks.”

These results are supported by other studies in other countries. For instance, research suggests that the slave trade still affects levels of trust in African countries that were heavily targeted by slave traders. There are similar findings for anti-Semitism: Towns and cities with a higher rate of pogroms during the Black death had higher Nazi vote shares in the 1928 election, higher deportation rates of Jews after 1933 and more synagogues destroyed during Kristallnacht.

Using the American National Election Studies 2012 survey, I examined three areas of racial opinion. The first examines structural race issues through questions that ask respondents whether they agree or disagree with these statements:

Slavery: “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class.”

Work: “Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same without any special favors.”

Dessert: “Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve.”

Effort: “It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.”

Discrimination: “How much discrimination do black people face?”

The first and second questions, which measure racial resentment, were used by Acharya et al.

The second area concerns racial stereotyping. The associated questions ask respondents to say whether they believe that black people are “hard-working” or “lazy,” “intelligent” or “unintelligent” and whether they have “too much influence” or “too little influence” in politics. And finally, I also look at attitudes towards solutions, such as whether respondents support government aid to blacks or think that the government should ensure fair jobs for blacks. My analysis focuses only on non-Hispanic whites in Confederate and non-Confederate states."

On one occasion, the existence of NPC was called into serious question. In February 1962, President John F. Kennedy wrote an executive order, “ Preventing Conflicts of Interest on the Part of Advisers and Consultants to the Government ,” pertaining to conflicts-of-interest for federal advisory committees such as NPC. Months later, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach wrote that NPC members “play essentially an industry role rather than an independent role” as they were supposedly intended to play according to NPC’s Articles of Organization .

Created in 1946 as the successor to the Petroleum Industry War Council, the NPC is an advisory committee to the Secretary of Energy consisting mostly of executives and CEOs of some of the biggest oil and gas companies on the planet. A case in point: its president is Charles D. Davidson, CEO of Noble Energy, and its vice president is the aforementioned Tillerson. As the “advisory” badge makes clear, NPC advises and influences U.S. and more broadly, global energy policy.

President Barack Obama just completed what in many ways was a historic trip: the first sitting President to visit Alaska’s Arctic . He was there to bear witness to climate change’s impacts.

Odds are that the next president will do nothing to repeal the policy-making clout of the National Petroleum Council.

Empowered by the blessing of federal law, NPC published a multi-volume report in 1980 whose reverberations are still being felt around the world today. The report centered around tapping into unconventional oil and gas resources, including shale basins, coal seams and production brine injection. A year later, NPC published another report titled, “U.S. Arctic Oil and Gas,” pushing drilling up north some three and a half decades before Obama’s Arctic approval.

Which brings us back to Obama’s visit. Myriad news articles and analysis pieces have been written about his trip to the Arctic. Some writers have defended him, while others have criticized him, but the main problem is the focus on him. Indeed, some Obama-centric critiques even play right into the cynical public relations framing his White House team has created around the trip, one revolving around his “climate legacy.”

Of course, like all matters of “legacy,” that will depend on the historian. Stenographers will write one version of history, while critics of Obama will craft an entirely different history. Regardless, moral “climate legacy” pleas to Obama depend on a flawed “Great Man” theory of history, one that says great leaders – and not institutions such as the NPC, oil and gas multinationals, environmental organizations and other organized blocs of power – sow the seeds of social change.

Were that the case, though, one would have a hard time explaining why Big Oil worked in concert with the U.S. government to create the NPC to begin with, why the ultra-rich create and finance Super-PACs, why activists organize as groups of people, and the list goes on. People, obviously, make up these institutions and may even be key leaders within them. But at the end of the day, these are the entities driving social and political change.

On January 20, 2017, a new president will be inaugurated to live in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Odds are, after seven decades of precedent, that he or she will do nothing to repeal the policy-making clout of the NPC.

“How important are these advisory committees? The top business leaders apparently think they are important, as shown by their participation on them,” University of California-Santa Cruz sociologist G. William Domhoff wrote in an article about federal advisory committees. “It shows that it is often the seemingly small things that matter to corporations when it comes to government regulations. The devil is in the details.”

Details such as the NPC — not questions of Obama’s “hypocrisy” or “climate legacy” — should be the focus for critics of Obama’s northern adventure. In this case, the devil will be the runaway climate change that scientists say Obama’s approval of tapping into the Arctic is all but certain to cause.

Everything in the new series felt familiar. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) offers laconic and matter-of-fact litanies of conspiracy indicators. His former partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) remains skeptical and competent and then is surprised when some of the theories turn out to be true. Plot twists turn conspiracies inside out and back again, until we’re not sure what’s true. There are flashbacks, secret groups working to uncover the truth and others working to cover it up and sympathetic characters who turn out to be dangerous and vice versa. By the end, we don’t really know what to believe. It’s a familiar ride containing all the elements I remember, but none of it really works for me.

I went back and watched a handful of my favorite episodes, trying to recapture the magic. I was relieved to find that they remain good television, notwithstanding that anything made before the rise of the smartphone now feels like a period piece. I remembered how they used to dominate my Sunday nights, after “The Simpsons” and whatever fare Fox tried to sandwich between them.



So what’s changed? One problem is that the new show expertly tries to re-create the Mulder-Scully dynamic without really acknowledging their shared past, beyond a few meaningful silences and looks. The bigger flaw, though, is that it’s hard to tell stories about conspiracies in the age of Edward Snowden.



Our sense of what we should fear has changed dramatically since the original “X-Files” went off the air. The new episode refers to 9/11 and the National Security Agency but doesn’t really deal with the fact that so many secret government activities are now out in the open yet nothing has changed.

Since 9/11, America has been at war against enemies that cannot be defeated on the battlefield. Our government has been given and has seized broad powers to infiltrate our lives. Perhaps even more significant, we grant access to our most intimate secrets and desires to corporations that turn around and use that data for advertising. As Bruce Schneier says, “Surveillance is the business model of the Internet,” and the government ensures that it can access private data whenever it needs. There are no safe secrets.

Against that backdrop, does it really make sense to fear a government conspiracy with advanced technology trying to control our lives? The technology is here. Moreover, the cabal trying to run the world isn’t secret either. Charles Koch and David Koch regularly and openly invite it to their California oceanside retreat and decide which political candidates to buy. We don’t get to see the guest list, but that’s just so we don’t boycott any products our corporate masters control, not because the nature of their power is secret."

A splinter group of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility and vowed to unleash an unrelenting assault against “schools, colleges and universities across Pakistan, as these are the foundations that produce apostates.” It said that these “apostates” would become Pakistan’s parliamentarians, lawyers and military leaders.

After the threats, some schools and universities were closed. The All Pakistan Private Schools Federation threatened to remain closed unless the government took concrete steps to improve security. Authorities acknowledge that they cannot protect all schools. There are more than 64,000 schools in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (the most affected province in terms of terrorist attacks in recent years) alone and only 68,000 police officers. To fill the gap, some schools have allowed schoolteachers to carry weapons.

The attack calls into question the progress of Pakistan’s “war on terrorism.” The military operations have had some success in recent years. Terrorist attacks have gone down significantly, and access to polio vaccinations and overall security have improved. But Islamabad is losing the ideology war. The government’s reluctance to hold clerics who preach extremism to account for propagandizing hate and inciting sectarianism has exacerbated fears of school attacks and emboldened the terrorists.

The Charsadda attack came just over a year after the assault on the Army Public School in Peshawar, on Dec. 16, 2014, which killed more than 140 students and four teachers. Militants have long targeted educational institutions in Pakistan, with few consequences, but the Peshawar attack triggered swift public outrage and government action.

Since 1970, Pakistan has had the most terrorist attacks on educational institutions in the world as well as the most people killed (450) in such attacks. Yet there was a short reprieve, a 70 percent decrease in attacks from the end of 2014 to September 2015, accompanied by an increased sense of security among ordinary Pakistanis. According to an Institute for Public Opinion Research poll conducted from March 20 to April 8, 2015, 62 percent of respondents said they felt safer in the country after the start of operation Zarb-e-Azab in June 2014. And up to 47 percent of respondents from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa said they felt “very safe.”

Pakistan is slowly moving toward a stable democracy. Despite Taliban attacks and intimidation of supporters of progressive political parties, the group failed to keep voters at home in the May 2013 elections. For the first time in its history, Pakistan had a peaceful transfer of power from one civilian government to another. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has seen subsequent victories in local elections despite stiff opposition and security threats.

There are positive developments in other areas as well. Although Pakistan is one of two countries that have yet to eradicate polio, it has seen a significant decrease in the number of new cases. Only 16 cases were reported in its federally administered tribal areas in 2015, compared with 179 cases in 2014. Even in areas dominated by terrorist activities, the proportion of children who did not have access to polio vaccinations fell from 31 percent in 2014 to 2 percent in 2015."

The Liberal Party campaigned on a platform of democratic reforms that would roll back many of Harper’s most egregious moves, such as barring government scientists from speaking publicly about their work. It has promised to promote greater government transparency and abolish an electoral system that encourages strategic voting, which worked very much in its favor this time around. Both Trudeau and the more left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) leader, Thomas Mulcair , have argued that Canada’s first-past-the-post system distorts democracy by encouraging voters to cast ballots on the basis of what they reject — for instance, Harper — rather than for the party or platform they prefer, allowing winners to wield 100 percent of the power with less than half the popular vote. Whether this was the cause of the NDP’s dramatic decline in seats, from 103 to 44, will be hotly debated in the coming weeks. But a host of other problems surrounding democratic participation, which were exacerbated by Harper but predated his reign, will likely remain largely unaddressed.

Election day confirmed this perception of dissatisfaction. Long lines snaked outside polling stations, with voter turnout of 68 percent of registered electors, compared with 58.8 percent in 2008 and 61.1 percent in in 2011.

In the course of the election cycle, Harper was caught between the failing, oil-dependent economy and a scandal over the expenses of Conservative senators. His record of austerity and draconian security measures that included a recent bill stripping citizenship from dual citizens convicted of terrorism, treason or spying alienated voters. In the month leading up to the election, a call from civil society to vote together against Harper became a major issue of national debate, reflecting a growing discontent over his policies.

This election, which lasted a seemingly interminable 78 days, was a clear referendum on Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whose nine years of leadership have marked a dramatic rightward shift in government and society. Harper has overseen severe rollbacks in environmental protections and civil rights; drastic cuts to the public sector, with the beloved Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a recent target; and repeated affronts to the democratic process, including suspending Parliament to protect his party.

But the optimism on display last night is suspect. Even if the Liberal Party carries out its planned reforms, its agenda will not usher in a substantially new vision of Canada.

Last night in Canada, the Conservative, the Liberal and the New Democratic parties competed in what was expected to be a tight contest for control of Parliament. But before polls had even closed, it was clear that the centrist Liberals swept the vote , and many Canadians are now celebrating the victory of the Liberals’ charismatic young leader, Justin Trudeau — the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada’s best-known statesmen.

Trudeau has complained about the secrecy surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, but with the deal effectively set in stone, any debate would be for show.

The most obvious issue is Bill C-51, the national security legislation that became law in June. C-51 expands the powers of the police and Canadian Security Intelligence Service; it raises enormous privacy and due process concerns that echo critiques of the U.S. Patriot Act. Critics ranging from Amnesty International to the novelist Margaret Atwood have noted that the law could be used to quash activism and political dissent. Trudeau, citing concerns over terrorist threats, nevertheless supports it.

Less obvious is the way in which colossal agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership are negotiated. The free-trade agreement was finalized two weeks before the elections, after many years of closed-door negotiations; it includes provisions about data storage that could threaten the privacy of financial and health data. Most significant, it will eliminate import tariffs on manufactured goods — which Unifor, the Canadian autoworkers’ union, has claimed will ruin the auto industry.

Despite the shock waves this agreement could send through the Canadian economy, its contents have yet to be publicly released. Trudeau has complained about this secrecy and is advocating for debate in Parliament to ensure that Canadians have a say in the matter (he is withholding full judgment until details are released but has reassured voters that he supports free trade), but with the deal effectively set in stone, any debate would be merely for show. A week before the vote, Mulcair castigated Trudeau and Harper for supporting the secretive trade deal, given its potentially catastrophic effects on workers, consumers and the economy at large. But without the power it once enjoyed, it’s unclear how much clout his party will have.

The future of energy development in Canada has fallen the farthest behind in ensuring that the voices of all those affected are heard. All three leading parties supported cross-continental pipeline projects to bring the oil sands to market. In Alberta, oil sands development — encouraged by generous corporate tax breaks under the Harper regime — has destroyed First Nations traditional territories and led communities such as the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to call for a moratorium on all new oil sands development until baselines for safe and sustainable development can be determined.

Despite his pledge to reform the National Energy Board in favor of more public participation and aboriginal consultation, Trudeau’s support of pipeline projects such as Keystone XL and Energy East — which enable the expansion of the oil sands — signals a disregard for First Nations rights. Mulcair was only marginally better: Although he opposed Keystone XL, he supports Energy East.

In the past decade, Canada’s progressive parties have gradually shifted rightward. This has eliminated real, institutional alternatives to the status quo; as in the United States, it’s virtually uncontested for profits to continue to be concentrated in the hands of oil investors and executives while First Nations communities remain effectively disenfranchised.

Plunging oil prices, which have already begun to stall the development of new oil sands projects, present a unique economic opportunity to shift away from the production of dirty, expensive oil to clean, renewable forms of energy. It’s up to the Canadian left to make that happen.

The NDP, which does not explicitly oppose oil sands development and (like the Liberals) supports reforming the National Energy Board, was reduced in the elections from the official opposition party to a position of marginal influence. It now finds itself in a similar position to the oil sands producers — the wind in its sails vanished, its relevance having suddenly dwindled. Perhaps it can find opportunity: By supporting a grass-roots movement for democratic rights, it can be revived as a true alternative to the status quo."
None,http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/9/executions-should-not-be-state-secrets.html,Executions Should Not Be State Secrets,"[u'Rafia Zakaria', u'Kareem Abdul-jabbar', u'Arthur Goldhammer', u'David Nicholl', u'Musa Al-gharbi']","[u'lockett', u'doctor', u'secrets', u'oklahoma', u'abortion', u'executions', u'state', u'doctors', u'lethal', u'execution', u'medical']","This argument reflects a hypocrisy and double standard that is rather astounding. For justice to be done, it should be open for the public to see that it is done, and that means proceeding in a transparent manner.

The state of Oklahoma has determined that the participation in executions should be confidential and that individuals participating in those events must be shielded from the harassment, threats and annoyance that are often the unfortunate consequences of aiding the state in executing its criminal sentences.

Oklahoma has asked the 10th Circuit to order that the doctor’s name be declared secret not only to the public but also to the Oklahoma Medical Board:

I absolutely do not mean to pass judgment on the doctor; this is the responsibility of his professional regulator, the state medical board. He would surely face difficult questions from the board for his alleged errors. However, Oklahoma has declared any analysis of this doctor’s actions off limits.

The doctor setting the IV first missed a vein, so the lethal drugs were not injected into Lockett’s bloodstream. Perhaps this is because he was a general practitioner, a family doctor who had no particular reason to practice inserting IVs. According to reports, he tried again and nicked an artery, splattering blood all around. By his next attempt, the drugs had run out. His suggestion that the prisoner be taken to the emergency room was rejected by Oklahoma prison authorities. After some 43 minutes of suffering, Lockett died of a heart attack.

I am one of a group of doctors filing an amicus brief (PDF) before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to try to ensure that there is some way to evaluate the gruesome mistakes that led to the botched execution of Clayton Lockett on April 29, 2014. Lockett, 38, was convicted in 2000 for murder, rape and kidnapping and imprisoned in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, until the date of his lethal injection.

As it is, the doctor’s name is already all over the Internet, so this is an exercise in futility. Plus there is no evidence that people have received threats for their involvement in executions. Contrast this with the Oklahoma attorney general’s explicitly threatening the lawyer for the Lockett family with sanctions for revealing the name of the doctor — information that the lawyer obtained legitimately, seemingly from someone who may well have felt there was an obligation to reveal possible professional negligence.

More significant, perhaps, is a comparison between death penalty opponents (who peacefully assert their right to free speech and insist on enforcement of the law) with opponents of abortion. “The most common form of domestic terrorism in the U.S. is violent attacks on abortion clinics,” economist Marina Adshade wrote, citing research from the National Bureau of Economic Research. “Between 1973 and 2003, over 300 abortion providers were the target of acts of extreme violence by anti-abortion groups.” In 1993, David Gunn of Pensacola, Florida, an obstetrics and gynecology doctor who provided abortion services, was murdered during a protest. Far from being protected by secrecy laws, his face had been splashed on wanted posters distributed by Operation Rescue for the previous year.

Far from taking similar steps to protect doctors who might be threatened by “domestic terrorists,” however, Oklahoma has imposed a raft of limitations on abortion providers, including criminal laws, some of which remain on the books despite being patently unconstitutional.

In 2014, Oklahoma passed an execution secrecy law that protects the identities of participants and the suppliers of drugs used. But the state needs to understand that the U.S. Constitution is not an inconvenience that may ignored. It infringes free speech rights to prevent the public to discuss those who participate in executions. Transparency ensures that, if the state wishes to execute people in our name, it is done with some degree of dignity and human decency — if that is possible. Further, keeping the Oklahoma Medical Board from reviewing whether the doctor committed gross malpractice in the Lockett case prevents the medical profession from policing itself and from ensuring the highest standards of medical practice. The executioner secrecy law ultimately has nothing to do with protecting doctors from threats; it is all about gagging critics and hiding the shameful evidence of botched executions.

After all, genuine transparency exposes executions for what they truly are. When Guatemala broadcast two lethal injections on television in 2000, people were so appalled by seeing doctors involved with this process that there has not been an execution since in the country. The reality is that executions in Oklahoma and elsewhere in the world are anything but transparent. The medical profession is being used to give a cloak of respectability to a wretched process. The harsh reality is this: Killing someone is not pleasant, regardless of method — lethal injection, decapitation, firing squad, hanging or gassing. Doctors and health care professionals should have no part of it.

We can only hope that the 10th Circuit issues Oklahoma a firm reminder that America is better than this. It is essential that all medical professionals, including the doctor involved in Lockett’s botched execution, be held to account for their actions."

This has important implications for the future of not only the country but also the rest of Europe. It is yet another example of how and why the eurozone remains in political upheaval, six years after the global recession. European economic policy, including austerity, has failed miserably; the eurozone has more than twice the unemployment rate of the United States. But the officials who decide economic policy are not offering a viable alternative; on the contrary, they want further fiscal tightening and regressive changes.

The ruling right-wing Popular Party (PP), headed by the country’s increasingly unpopular Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, took 123 seats of a 350-member parliament, with 28.7 percent of the vote. The center-left Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), which lost to the PP in 2011 because of its support for austerity, won 90 seats. Since neither party is close to a majority, it remains to be seen whether a stable government can be formed.

Although the Spanish economy has been growing for the past year and a half, the recovery hasn’t trickled down to most of the population. Unemployment is at 21.6 percent — one of the highest among developed countries — and 47.7 percent for youths. About 60 percent of the jobless are long-term unemployed, out of work for more than a year. Since 2007, more than 3 million people have joined the ranks of those classified as at risk of poverty and social exclusion.

The two-party system was crashed first by Podemos, which surprised pollsters by winning 69 seats in Sunday’s vote. A leftist party less than two years in existence, Podemos grew out of mass protests against austerity, joblessness and the corruption of the PP, including Rajoy. Led by Pablo Iglesias, a 37-year-old professor with a long ponytail and inexpensive blue jeans, Podemos captured the biggest following in the country by November 2014. But then a new party, Ciudadanos (Citizens), appeared, sometimes referred to as the Podemos of the right. With clever marketing and an appeal to youths, Ciudadanos ascended quickly to media stardom and ended up with 40 seats in the elections. But it was Podemos that offered a programmatic economic alternative to current failures — including measures to increase employment, public investment and educational opportunities as well as progressive tax reform and an end to austerity.

Although there are other important political issues — for example, the question of independence for the region of Catalonia — the economy is the biggest one. Spain piled up massive private borrowing in the run-up to the world financial crisis and recession and had a real estate bubble even bigger relative to its economy than the U.S. did. Spain was hit hard when its real estate and stock market bubbles burst. But after some initial stimulus in 2009, the government was pressured by European authorities to adopt austerity policies that pushed the economy back into recession and increased unemployment."

The decision by Abbas, who serves as the chairman of the committee, and his colleagues brought action and suspense to a largely forgotten body. It gave the Palestine National Council (PNC), the PLO’s legislative organ, which elects the executive committee, new powers, as it has been asked to intervene. PLO rules state that if two-thirds of the executive committee members resign, an emergency meeting of those who are able to attend should be convened without quorum to elect a new committee. That meeting is scheduled to take place within a month. Some members who resigned last week want to see young and new voices leading the Palestinian liberation movement, believing that the Palestinians’ future should not be tied to any single person. This could usher in a new phase and fresh leadership in the Palestinian struggle for statehood. “I would like to see the PLO reformed and revitalized,” said Hanan Ashrawi the day after she resigned from the committee. “It has become a depleted dysfunctional organization that badly needs new blood, new ideas and, therefore, new elections.” Ashrawi, who was elected in 2009 to the culture and communications portfolio, insisted that she would not seek re-election. She said that the aging organization needs new leaders and has lost the respect of many Palestinians, even as the Palestinian government has received more. But Abbas’ recent actions to oust the PLO’s secretary-general and replace him with a close ally suggest that he wants to replace independent members holding key positions in the organization with his loyalists. He is capitalizing on public frustration with the lack of progress on the peace process to solidify his base and consolidate his powers.

Israel-Hamas truce

Abbas’ threats of resignation are not new. He warned of it as far back as 2009. But his hand was forced when he realized that Hamas was not interested in national reconciliation. Hamas is reportedly looking to strike a separate long-term deal with Israel. It comes at a time of Palestinian failure to resolve a split between Hamas and Abbas’ Fatah that opened in 2007, after pro-Hamas candidates swept key positions in the 2006 elections and Hamas fighters routed pro-Abbas security forces and took control of the Gaza Strip. Repeated efforts to reconcile the two factions and organize national elections have failed. The differences were exacerbated by reports of possible indirect talks for a long-term truce between Hamas and the Israeli government. The deal was reportedly engineered by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who until May served as special Middle East envoy for the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia. Blair has made two visits to Hamas Chairman Khaled Meshaal in Doha, Qatar, in recent weeks. The deal apparently includes the end of Israel’s blockade of Gaza via the opening of a water corridor with Cyprus in return for a long-term cease-fire. (Israel has denied holding direct or indirect talks with Hamas, but Meshaal has confirmed engaging in indirect negotiations with Israel.)

In the event that Abbas’ resignation sets the stage for his exit from the PLO, it would be the end of an era for the founding leadership of the movement.

The PNC’s emergency session will not resemble the reconstituted PLO largely because invited representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad will not attend. Abbas is counting on traditional PLO supporters from Fatah and allied nationalists and independents that constitute the majority of the organization. If two-thirds of the PNC’s 760 members attend the meeting in Ramallah, the session will have more powers to tackle major policy issues and give direction for the Palestinian liberation movement. Many observers expect Abbas to be re-elected as chairman — with an even stronger mandate and less opposition.

It was this poisonous mentality that was at work Monday, when school administrators in Irving, Texas, had a Muslim teenager arrested for bringing a homemade digital clock to school after a teacher said it looked like a bomb. Ahmed Mohamed, a talented 14-year-old with a well-known aptitude for electronic tinkering, told The Dallas Morning News that he built the clock in 20 minutes the previous night to impress his engineering instructor. By 3 p.m., Ahmed was suspended from school and being escorted out of McArthur High School in handcuffs.

The Dallas paper reported that police “may yet charge him with making a hoax bomb” and had an “ongoing investigation” into the device, despite being clearly and repeatedly shown that it is, in fact, a clock. But this easily verifiable fact hardly mattered. The school immediately called the police. Upon first meeting Ahmed, the paper reported, one of the officers exclaimed, “Yup. That’s who I thought it was,” making Ahmed feel “suddenly conscious of his brown skin and his name.”

On Twitter, the absurd story was rightly seized upon as an ugly confluence of tech illiteracy, overpolicing and deeply entrenched Islamophobia. The case quickly drew outrage and support from the tech world and beyond as the hashtag #IStandWithAhmed began trending. The influential blogger Anil Dash started circulating an online form allowing people to send their good wishes to Ahmed’s family, while others called for the police officers and school administrators involved to be fired. On Wednesday, the police chief announced that charges won’t be filed and Ahmed received his invitation to the White House. But his school maintained the suspension until Thursday.

Ahmed’s treatment is neither anomalous nor surprising. It’s merely a symptom of the same bigotry and irrational paranoia the U.S. government’s never-ending war on terror is responsible for helping to incubate — the negative effects of which are routinely and overwhelmingly felt by Muslims and people of color.

Particularly revealing of this mentality was a shocking letter about the incident that McArthur High principal Daniel Cummings sent to school parents. Rather than explain the situation and apologize to Ahmed’s family, the letter depicts the violation of his civil rights as “a good time to remind your child how important it is to immediately report any suspicious items and/or suspicious behavior they observe,” even while acknowledging “the item discovered did not pose a threat to your child’s safety.”"

Of his policy positions, nothing has distinguished his campaign more than his ultra hard-line immigration proposals. These two facts are mostly undisputed, but so far commentators have focused on how both a Trump presidency and the imposition of such strict border controls are unfeasible. It’s a good way to avoid reckoning with their substance and consequences. When we’re talking about millions of lives at risk, however, it pays to be mentally prepared.

In order to “make America great again,” Trump wants first to better define it. Candidate Trump, if elected, plans to build a wall around the country. He also wants Mexico to pay for the construction costs. It’s a ridiculous, albeit somewhat popular, project, but the wall deflects attention from the rest of his dead-serious immigration plan.

Trump has accumulated a lot of support from the GOP nativist base in large part because they trust him to enforce immigration laws. The first sentence in his plan is “When politicians talk about ‘immigration reform’ they mean: amnesty, cheap labor and open borders,” and he’s right. Few national politicians and fewer business leaders are serious about deporting 11 million people. Undocumented immigrants are a necessary part of the national economy; American enforcement practices are designed to manage, not eliminate, violations of border laws.

A strain of American resentment can’t deal with this contradiction: If some people are allowed to violate the law, they must be doing so at the expense of lawful citizens. It’s not true; undocumented immigrants (not to mention over 50 million Latino Americans nativists are really talking about) contribute to the national economy, tax base, culture and social fabric in innumerable ways. But racism and xenophobia make inspiring campaign themes. “Enforce the law,” they say. But “enforce the law” would mean splitting the country in ways that are so horrific, they are difficult to contemplate.

First of all, there’s the scale. Deporting 11 million people would be a population transfer so large it only has a couple historical precedents, and one of them is Adolf Hitler's. To extract that many people from their communities would require a much larger and more determined effort that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is capable of at present. To this end, Trump proposes tripling the number of ICE officers, specifically geared to increase deportations. In a country with volunteer border patrols and lasting unemployment, I don’t think President Trump would have a problem recruiting.

Sending an amped-up ICE on a mass-deportation mission wouldn’t just be an assault on undocumented people and their families, it would be an attack on American cities, where more than 90 percent of them live. For large municipalities, rigorously enforcing immigration law is unfeasible but also politically unpopular. So-called “sanctuary cities” have declared their ongoing intention to drag their feet when it comes to cooperating with the Feds. For example, law enforcement in many cities (including New York) selectively complies with ICE requests to hold people in custody on suspicion of being undocumented. ICE can’t do their job without local cooperation and the use of these legally questionable detention orders has decreased by more than 70 percent in the last four years."

I was among supporters from all over the world waiting there to celebrate a symbolic moment — the first global recognition not only of this humble monk in exile but also of his cause, his land and the people and wisdom culture of Tibet.

In those simpler days, before he would be swept to presidential meetings in motorcades, the Dalai Lama walked among us. On that evening, he embraced us one by one as our candle flames flickered in the darkness. People started to sing spontaneously, in many different languages, but somehow it became one song, one language, one voice.

I recall this magical moment today with a particular poignancy, because this Dec. 10 coincides with the COP21 climate talks in Paris that are critical to the survival of our planet.

One of the reasons the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Dalai Lama was for his promotion of global interdependence and protection of the environment. In his acceptance speech, he said, “Both science and the teachings of the Buddha tell us of the fundamental unity of all things. This understanding is crucial if we are to take positive and decisive action on the pressing global concern with the environment.”

This vision has never been needed more, as governments attempt to forge a global treaty to limit carbon emissions and bring financial assistance to the poor, who will be the worst hit by a threat that is potentially more catastrophic than any war or disaster ever known.

One of the most alarming findings by international scientists — among them, many Chinese — is that the Dalai Lama’s home, Tibet, now under Chinese control, is warming nearly three times as fast as the rest of the earth. This matters to all of us. The size of Western Europe and the world’s highest and largest plateau, Tibet, the roof of the world, is also known as the earth’s third pole because it contains the biggest reserves of freshwater outside the Arctic and Antarctic. Its changing climate affects not only the monsoon in Asia but also weather patterns in Europe and across the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Tibet may be the canary in the coal mine.

As the source of most of Asia’s major rivers, including the Yangtze, the Mekong and the Brahmaputra, Tibet’s fragile ecology is of critical importance to hundreds of millions of people in the water-dependent societies downstream.

We have seen terrorism’s indiscriminate indictment of celebration happen many times before. In making the festive the condemned, terrorism’s torture masters imagine themselves underscoring some moral truth, provoking a juxtaposition of the suffering and war-torn against the callously jolly, in this case also the Western and the Parisian. It is a grand deception: Terrorism’s targeting of the merry is universal and indiscriminate, a division of the world between those who wish to live and laugh and hope and those who kill and destroy. The latter are deadly and relentless, and they have already squeezed out the mirth from too many of the world’s cities, from Karachi, Kabul and Baghdad to Nairobi and Beirut.

The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the assaults, saying that it “set out targeting the capital of prostitution and vice” and attacked Bataclan, “where hundreds of pagans gathered for a concert of prostitution and vice.” Thus are the joys of Paris and of civilization itself — music, sport, cuisine, joie de vivre — judged and sentenced.

When the carnage finally halted late in the night, more than 120 people were dead, and more than 200 lay injured . The city of Paris was put under curfew, its mirth and merriment stanched by death.

In a series of coordinated attacks on the night of Friday the 13th, armed gunmen attacked venues of culture and leisure in central Paris, launching a citywide offensive against merriment. Eight assailants undertook the lurid killing spree, some attacking diners at restaurants, three others blowing themselves up amid revelers near the Stade de France, where Les Bleus were playing Germany in a friendly soccer match. At the crowded Bataclan concert hall, where nearly 1,000 people had gone to hear the American band Eagles of Death Metal, four men stormed the venue and held approximately 100 concertgoers at gunpoint. After several hours, the assailants began shooting hostages one by one. When the police raided the building, three of the four attackers detonated suicide vests.

The first time I learned that terrorism is at war against celebration was when I was in high school in Karachi, Pakistan. The son of a doctor, a family friend of ours, had just passed a big exam; to mark the achievement, he went to meet friends at a restaurant. There was a bomb blast, and he was killed.

There have been thousands of blasts and attacks in Pakistan before and since, and they have transformed my country. On March 3, 2009, a bus carrying Sri Lankan cricketers was attacked in Lahore, Pakistan. There were 12 gunmen who encircled part of the convoy as it tried to make it to the stadium. Six cricketers were injured, and eight others were killed. Pakistani cricket, a sport that nourishes millions and is played in every nook and alley in the country, was crippled. Pakistan, which was to jointly host the 2011 Cricket World Cup, was stripped of its hosting rights by the International Cricket Board. For years hence, no foreign teams would visit, no matches could be held, there were no championships to cheer, no scores to track. The terrorists had struck, and at least for a while, they won. The fun of a sport, watched and cheered, was no longer available.

Pakistan’s story has become the narrative of so many countries at the front lines of fighting terrorism in its various incarnations. The attacks in Paris occurred a day after attacks in Beirut took the lives of at least 43 people and injured more than 200 others. In the evening rush in Burj al-Barajneh, a commercial area known for cafes and shops, a suicide bomber slipped inside a bakery and detonated his suicide vest. Like the Parisians who would be felled a day later, his victims had simply been enjoying themselves — eating, drinking and never knowing what was coming. Another suicide bomber detonated himself minutes later.

Similarly, one year ago on Nov. 23, a large crowd was gathered outside Yahya Khel, Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan. They arrived to watch a volleyball tournament featuring teams from a large surrounding area. There were many young people and children, and the mood was festive. This last fact was enough to make the event a target. A suicide bomber struck, and what had been an arena of sport became the venue of tragedy. After the blast and the sorting of the mayhem, 61 were dead, many of them children.

Last night’s attacks in Paris occurred 10 months after that other assault on mirth, at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The attacks in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon and Iraq are too numerous to count and so often forgotten. There was, however, a time when terrorism was newly terrifying even in those places, a time when people insisted that they would not be afraid or suspicious or paranoid. In those times, the calculation of eating at a café in Beirut or shopping at a market in Karachi did not have to include, on at least some subconscious level, a fatalism about sudden, violent death. In these places, terrorism has not been able to annihilate celebration, but it has shorn it of its innocence and its hopefulness and infused it with hesitation.

With yesterday’s horrors, Paris has joined the uneasy fellowship of other terrorism-tormented lands, where the fearlessness of the past becomes ever more distant and elusive. The greatest horror, ever the hope of terrorism, occurs when its targets suspect the least, are unaware of just how grotesque a simple evening out, a sporting event or a concert can be. So it was in Paris last night, an unassuming city, an innocent commitment to fun, annihilated in a few hours.

In his statement, French President François Hollande called the attacks an “act of war.” The French future will undoubtedly be one of greater security, greater surveillance and, inevitably, greater suspicion. Each is, of course, seen as crucial to ensuring safety. But fun is a more delicate thing, tainted easily by paranoia, destroyed completely by terror."

Similar reflections about social justice, however, have been almost entirely absent from U.S. schoolrooms. As politicians and parents vehemently debate the role of the Common Core, teachers and students remain largely silent about the roles of skin color on one’s learning experience.

More than ever, race as a construct of civic and personal identity is critical to talk about with children. Pretending that racial stressors do not exist in their minds and daily experiences is to pretend that their learning is not affected by their social and emotional states. The increasingly diverse makeup of U.S. classrooms means that students will wrestle with these questions of race whether educators guide them or not.

But introducing such discourse into classrooms requires planning and administrative support. For most public schools, the testing mandates of the Common Core standards, which focus on English language arts and math, make these kinds of dialogues nearly impossible. According to David Kirkland, an associate professor of education at New York University who researches English education and urban studies, standardization, accountability and high-stakes testing have “swallowed up a lot of real estate in the school day” that might otherwise be allocated to talking with students about real-world problems.

Too much time is mandated for drills and test taking at the expense of actually educating the child. A 2013 study (PDF) from the American Federation of Teachers found that students in heavily tested grades spend 20 to 50 hours a year taking standardized exams and another 60 to 110 hours in preparations.

The standards themselves are not necessarily nefarious; the Common Core suggests reading challenging texts by black authors such as Frederick Douglass and Richard Wright. There are no standards, however, emphasizing social and emotional learning or self-identity. While the fates of schools and teachers reside in their test score results, there is nothing to encourage — and everything to discourage — nuanced discussions of race and social status.

Not allowing children to wrestle with labels of identity and vocalize their feelings of belonging can isolate them, depriving them of the tools to negotiate how society sees them. It can also suggest that inequality is something that exists only in the past. Brigitte Fielder, an assistant professor of comparative literature who teaches courses in race and gender studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, finds that her well-intentioned undergraduate students arrive at college without the “tools or the language to engage in antiracist discourse. It’s not that they don’t want to talk about these things. They have never had to do it before.” Many students come from segregated or cloistered environments in which race and racism are not openly discussed."

But besides a few grumbles from poets who didn’t make the cut, no one would have heard anything about this process if a white guy named Michael Derrick Hudson hadn’t submitted a poem under the name Yi-Fen Chou, hoping to game a system that he thought treated him unfairly.

Hudson won the battle (and inclusion in the anthology), but lost the reputation war; he will, perhaps fittingly, need a third name if he wants to continue publishing. But the debate over affirmative action will outlast this particular controversy, and Alexie’s honesty gives us a starting place for rethinking it.

Alexie does not play dumb in his explanation. He admits exactly what many whites have long feared: “Bluntly stated, I was more amenable to the poem because I thought the author was Chinese-American.” “Aha!” say the Michael Derrick Hudsons of the world, who believe they’ve caught someone doing something wrong: discriminating on the basis of race.

But this reaction represents a huge misunderstanding about what affirmative action is for, how it works and why it’s a good idea for everyone. White supremacy and patriarchy are wrong not just because they’re unfair or mean or deleterious; they’re also incorrect in their premises that whites and men (and white men in particular) are by nature any better at anything than anyone else. Starting with this simple (albeit political) fact, affirmative action doesn’t even seem radical; it seems obvious.

Taste in poetry is by definition subjective, so it’s hard to argue that Alexie’s volume of “Best American Poetry” (60 percent women, 40 percent nonwhite) is conclusively better than it would have been without affirmative action. There’s also no reason to believe Alexie’s weighted selection hurt the overall product, though; in fact, there’s good reason to believe it helped.

Comparing poets is difficult, but comparing professors is a little easier, and from Alexie’s accounting, we know that 99 percent of the writers included in “Best American Poetry 2015” teach. There is a lot of quantitative research into diversity in the academy, and all of it points to the fact that being a professor in any field is easier for white men. Racial minorities are largely underpromoted on the path from associate to full professor, but it’s not for lack of effort; a study at the University of Massachusetts found white male associate professors spent the least amount of time on service to their school and profession and student mentoring, by a substantial margin."

After a public outcry, the Lion Academy Trust, which runs the school, said that exceptions would be made in certain cases and that parents who want their children to fast should meet with school officials.

The news of the fasting ban prompted criticisms from Muslim leaders. “We believe that this … should be decided by parents with their children, who can together reach a collective decision whether or not the child can fast,” a spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain told The Mail Online. On the surface, the fasting ban appears as a misguided policy enacted by overzealous school administrators who believe that they, instead of parents, know what is best for their young students.

“We have sought guidance and are reliably informed that in Islamic law, children are not required to fast during Ramadan,” the Barclay letter said. It is odd that a secular school would try to tell Muslim parents what their religion does or does not require. In any case, the incident offers important insights into the problems the U.K. faces with its Muslim minority.

Unlike the United States, the U.K. does not have a strict, constitutionally mandated separation of church and the state. And since the Anglican Church is a crucial part of the state machinery, citizens cannot keep religion out of schools by appealing to a law that applies to all faiths. (It is the state church, the queen is the head of the church, and a number of state and church functions are linked.) This is why the authorities have turned to creating a state-sanctioned and unthreatening brand of Islam, whose practice they can permit without worrying about incipient terrorism. In the view of primary school administrators in East London, children’s fasting is not part of this moderate Muslim practice. Resistance to the school’s no-fasting rule can hence be considered a sign of anti-state sentiment and an opposition to supposedly British values — markers of potential radicalism.

Telling the faithful what their religion does or does not allow is an old project. In colonial India, for example, the British codified Islamic law and eliminated the plurality of the multiple schools of Islamic thought. And a new statute-based Islamic law that supported the colonial project of control and conquest was constructed in its stead. This allowed the British to decide whether a practice was permissible under Islam. The latest iteration uses the same strategy: telling British Muslims that asking their children to fast is not Islamic.

The story raises further worries. British primary schools are turning into a battleground in the United Kingdom’s “war on terrorism,” in which teachers serve as the government’s eyes and ears. It is part of the recent surveillance and monitoring schemes targeting Muslim students, which may serve only to further isolate the very youths whose radicalization they are ostensibly designed to prevent."

I was standing on the tarmac watching when he descended from the plane. We chatted for a few minutes as Guatemalan immigration agents processed his arrival as a deportee. He gave me his number, and I promised to call and check on him in about a month. Thousands of Guatemalan deportees like Eric have returned to their country of birth over the last few years. More than 50,000 people are deported from the U.S. each year, with four to six planeloads arriving at the Guatemalan air force base each week in 2014. As promised, I met up with Eric a little over a month after his return to Guatemala, at Metro Norte, an upscale shopping center in Zona 18, one of the rougher neighborhoods of Guatemala City. He told me he traveled to the United States alone at the age of 11 on a tourist visa to join his mother, who was already living in the U.S. As an undocumented immigrant, Eric’s mother could not secure an immigrant visa for him. Eric attended school in Inglewood in Los Angeles, where his mother worked at a garment factory. In his last year of high school, Eric’s mother injured her back and was unable to continue working. Eric had to drop out of school and get a job to keep the family afloat. He soon married a Salvadoran woman, who is a legal permanent resident of the United States. One Saturday afternoon, Eric drove his friend to the other side of town. He was pulled over and arrested shortly after dropping off his friend, whom the police suspected of a car theft. Once at the Los Angeles County Jail, which participated in the Secure Communities program, a police officer ran Eric’s fingerprints through an immigration database. The program — designed to find and deport dangerous noncitizens — enables officers to determine if an arrestee is in the country legally. The police held Eric and called in immigration agents once they discovered he had overstayed his visa. Eric was then sent to a privately owned Corrections Corp. of America detention center until he was removed from the United States. Eric’s innocence of car theft and his pending application for legalization on the basis of marriage to a legal resident could not prevent his deportation. In Guatemala City, Eric moved into his aunt’s house. He soon secured a job at a call center run by an American company. As a bilingual deportee familiar with the United States’ social and cultural norms, he is an ideal worker for the corporation. His labor is also significantly cheaper: His job pays $400 a month — enough to support himself in Guatemala but not sufficient to raise a family. Eric finds himself in the same conditions that led his mother to emigrate — working for a transnational corporation and earning just enough to get by.

Globalization, enhanced by neoliberal reforms, facilitates the movement of capital across borders while restricting the mobility of workers.

The interrelated nature of each of the events in Eric’s life and their connection to neoliberal reforms lays bare what I call a neoliberal cycle, the interconnected aspects of neoliberal reforms implemented in the United States and abroad. Some of its elements include outsourcing, economic restructuring, cutbacks in social services, the enhancement of criminal and immigration law enforcement and the privatization of public services. Neoliberal reforms are aimed at opening up local economies to global markets and reducing state spending on social welfare. It involves cuts to government funding, with the notable exception of the military and law enforcement. The reforms constitute a cycle insofar as they lead to and reproduce one another.

Eric’s story fits neatly into this cycle. His mother felt compelled to leave Guatemala because of the economic havoc neoliberalism wreaked in their home country. During the 1960s and ’70s, poor countries such as Guatemala borrowed money from the World Bank to build dams for electricity, construct ports and modernize their agriculture to produce cash crops. The intent was to enable these countries to import items and export their cash crops and natural resources. Globalization was happening, and developing countries wanted to reap the benefits. In the 1980s, however, interest rates and oil prices skyrocketed, which made it impossible for developing countries to make loan payments to the bank. They turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to request assistance in stabilizing their economies and paying debts. The IMF agreed to lend money, but under the condition that the countries implement a standard set of neoliberal reforms. The recommended reform package included privatization, trade liberalization, tax reductions, deregulation and cutbacks in social services. The reforms exacerbated inequality and created severe economic and social disruptions, leading to mass emigration. Eric’s mother was part of that initial exodus that arrived in the United States looking for better opportunities. But the immigrants confronted a U.S. economy ravaged in its own way by neoliberal reforms. Manufacturers have moved most garment industry jobs abroad, and those jobs that remain are low paid and offer few to no benefits. As an undocumented worker in a garment factory, Eric’s mother could not challenge her low pay and lack of benefits. When she became ill, there was no safety net — another factor related to cutbacks in social services under neoliberalism. Eric had to leave school and secure employment to support his family. The state did not provide resources to help his family in troubled times. But it maintained robust law enforcement. From 1984 to 2005, California built 23 major prisons, at a cost of about $300 million each, amid growing poverty and inequality. The escalation in spending and heavy policing of poor and minority neighborhoods facilitated Eric’s arrest and deportation. Once in custody, Eric was placed in a private prison. (The privatization of public services and profitability of prisons are among the key elements of neoliberalism.) Globalization, enhanced by neoliberal reforms, facilitates the movement of capital across borders while restricting the mobility of workers. This makes it possible for Eric, a deportee, to work for a U.S. corporation in his native Guatemala. The arrival of 50,000 deportees a year in Guatemala ensures a steady supply of bilingual workers for this transnational corporation. Nearly half the workers at the call center where Eric works are deportees. In other words, mass deportation from the United States is critical to the sustainability of neoliberal economies at home and abroad.

A year after allegations surfaced that French peacekeepers in the CAR abused 10 boys they were deployed to protect, no one has been held accountable except the whistleblower who disclosed the abuse. France sent peacekeepers to the CAR in December 2013 after violence between Muslim and Christian militias led to a humanitarian crisis and massive displacement. From December 2013 to June 2014, peacekeepers forced the boys, ages 8 to 15, to trade sex for food at a camp for displaced people in the CAR’s capital, Bangui. Six of the boys recounted their trauma to U.N. investigators in May and June 2014.

On March 28 of this year, the U.N. finally sent an official copy of the investigation to French authorities, with names redacted. With its sordid colonial past in Africa, France is sensitive to its image in the continent. It launched criminal proceedings against 14 of its troops for the abuse last month. The U.N. and French authorities are now trading recriminations for the delay in the investigation.

But the slow pace and missteps in the investigation of the abuse underscore the flaws that plague all peacekeeping missions and reveal the U.N.’s abiding failure to institute safeguards to protect victims of sexual abuse by peacekeepers despite repeated promises to correct systematic deficiencies. The U.N. must develop and implement policy and political reforms to end sexual exploitation by peacekeepers, including accountability for wrongdoers and those who fail to protect victims.

Sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers is not a new problem. A decade ago, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, now the U.N. human rights chief, penned a scathing report on the U.N.’s management of sexual abuse allegations. But resistance from troop-contributing countries thwarted real reform. Typically, troop-contributing countries seek assurances that they do not cede military authority over their personnel to a foreign government, citing cultural and geopolitical differences among various legal systems. “All military personnel working under the blue helmet are first and foremost members of their own national armies and are then seconded to work with the U.N.,” according to the U.N. Peacekeeping office."

“I know the closure of AJAM will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future,” Anstey wrote in an email addressed to all the company’s employees. The decision was no reflection on the work of that staff, he said. “Our commitment to great journalism is unrivaled. We have increasingly set ourselves apart from all the rest. And you are the most talented team any organization could wish for.”

The announcement of AJAM’s closure coincides with a decision by its global parent company to commit to a significant expansion of its worldwide digital operations into the U.S. market.

“As audiences increasingly turn to multiple platforms, including mobile devices, for news and information, this expansion will allow U.S. and non-U.S. consumers alike to access the network’s journalism and content wherever and whenever they want,” the Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement. “By expanding its digital content and distribution services to now include the U.S., the network will be better positioned to innovate and compete in an overwhelmingly digital world to serve today’s 24-hour digitally focused audience.”

Anstey praised the Al Jazeera America staff as “a brilliant team made up of the most committed, professional and dedicated people … In the months to come, we will do everything that we can to support you, to work with you and to ensure you are shown the respect you deserve.”

Despite its initial struggle for TV ratings, the newcomer network was quickly and repeatedly recognized by its industry peers for the excellence of its journalism. Within months of launching, AJAM began collecting prestigious prizes — from Peabody, Emmy, Gracie, Eppy and DuPont awards to a Shorty Award, for best Twitter newsfeed, and Newswomen’s Club of New York’s Front Page awards and citations from groups such as the National Association of Black Journalists and the Native American Journalism.

Anstey said AJAM made slow but steady progress in recent months in growing its audience. “Our editorial excellence was demonstrated time and time again on the major stories of recent months,” he wrote. “And we continue to win praise from our colleagues in the industry and from our viewers for the quality of our output.

He vowed that AJAM would maintain its standards of excellence until it goes dark.

“Between now and April, we will continue to show America why AJAM has won respect and the fierce loyalty of so many of our viewers,” Anstey wrote. “Through your remarkable work at AJAM, we have shown that there is a different way of reporting news and providing information. The foundation of this is integrity, great journalism, impartiality and a commitment to the highest quality story telling. This will be our lasting impact, and as we produce and showcase the best of our work in the weeks to come, this will be clear for everyone to see.”"

Ne jenjava rasprava o najavi referenduma u Republici Srpskoj o danu tog bh. entiteta, niti njegov predsjednik Milorad Dodik popušta pred tim raspravama i verbalnim ""pritiscima"" koje odašilju neke političke stranke, strane diplomate i međunarodna zajednica. Dodik je izričit - bez obzira na odluku Ustavnog suda Bosne i Hercegovine o neustavnosti provođenja referenduma, izjašnjavanje u RS-u će biti održano 25. septembra ove godine.

Kao kontramjeru, bošnjački predstavnici vlasti u Srebrenici najavili su raspravu o održavanju referenduma na kojem bi se izjašnjavalo o otcjepljenju tog gradića iz RS-a, a s idejom o referendumu javilo se i Udruženje ""Žena-žrtva rata"", koje traži izjašnjavanje za cjelovitu državu Bosnu i Hercegovinu, bez entiteta.

O situaciji u kojoj se našla Bosna i Hercegovina mjesec i po pred lokalne izbore, a koja na mahove podsjeća na onu iz 1992. godine, razgovarali smo sa Srđanom Šušnicom, pravnikom i kulturologom iz Banje Luke.

Zbog najavljenog referenduma, neki građani su u strahu od ponovnih izbijanja sukoba, pogotovo stoga što pravni stručnjaci izjavljuju da se njegovi eventualni rezultati ne mogu provesti bez upotrebe sile. S druge strane, postoje oni koji čitavu ovu priču iščitavaju kao politički marketing pred naredne izbore u Bosni i Hercegovini. Da li se radi samo o tome i dokle sežu granice kada je u pitanju politička propaganda?

- U ovakvoj Bosni zamrznutog konflikta teško je odvojiti tenzije koji su rezultat političkog marketinga od njihovih dugoročnih posljedica, ili, pak, nosilaca i njihovih političkih interesa. Referendum i kontrareferendum su definitivno sredstvo proizvođenja tenzija u cilju osvajanja vlasti na izborima za obje trenutno vladajuće vrhuške. I političari u Stranci demokratske akcije, i oni u Savezu nezavisnih socijaldemokrata, trebaju ovakve međuetničke tenzije, jer bez njih ishodi izbora su im neizvjesni, a to sebi ne smiju priuštiti.

I ne bi me čudilo da su ovi potezi unaprijed dogovoreni između Bakira [Izetbegovića] i Dodika i njihovih administrativno-stranačkih, porodično-zavičajnih i tajkunskih hobotnica. Obje vrhuške imaju mnogo toga za izgubiti i ne žele se kockati.

Pa, jesu li i takozvani Srbi i takozvani Bošnjaci u oba entiteta svjesni koliko milijardi su i jedni i drugi popljačkali i iznijeli iz Bosne? Pa, jedina razlika između koruptivnih struktura SNSD-a i SDA je u tome što koriste usluge i mitomanske narative dvije različite religijsko-crkvene mafije i što opljačkani novac sklanjaju u dva različita bankarsko-politička režima, takozvani Srbi u Rusiji, a takozvani Bošnjaci u Turskoj. Smatram da za međusobne odnose ovih dviju mafijaških hobotnica nije nevažno ni ovo geopolitičko približavanje Rusije i Turske.

No, ja bih, ipak, rekao da se Dodiku više ljulja stolica nego Bakiru [Izetbegoviću], pa smatram da ipak Dodiku i SNSD-u ta referendumska priča sada više treba nego SDA. Dodik balansira rizicima koji dolaze što iz bh. pravosuđa, što iz izborne baze u RS-u, i njemu je od životne važnosti da građanima RS-a svakodnevno pere mozak ultranacionalističkim mitovima, ""srpskim neprijateljima"" i namišljenom samostalnošću RS-a.

'Diletantska odluka' u Srebrenici

Na to ima uticaja i centralizovanije uređenje i politička scena u RS-u, pa se gubitak vlasti u nekoliko većih opština u RS-u više osjeti na entitetskom nivou, dočim se u Federaciji Bosne i Hercegovine taj gubitak amortizuje kroz kantonalne nivoe vlasti. Na kraju krajeva, Dodik se sa referendumom poigrava - što retorički, što institucionalno - zadnjih pet godina. Bez ovih referendumskih i drugih ultranacionalizmom obojenih tenzija, ovaj kriminalni režim u RS-u bi definitivno gubio izbore i u Banjoj Luci, i u mnogim drugim opštinama.

S druge strane, sama ideja da se organizuje kontrareferendum u Srebrenici je diletantska i vidi se da ne dolazi od ozbiljnih državnika, koji imaju viziju i osjećaj državničke odgovornosti, niti je dio neke strategije, već je nekontorlisano blebetanje političkih diletanata i mafijaša, koji zlorabe žrtvu i muku svojih građana da se bogate i ubiru političke poene. To je postalo vulgarno i ogavno. Mogao se osmisliti 101 drugačiji odgovor koji bi imao državničku notu i odmah polučio efekte, ali za tako nešto potrebna je inteligencija i mnogo predanog političkog rada i etike. Da je vrhuška u Sarajevu iole inteligentnija, manje koruptivna, državničkija i etičkija, ovakvo entitetsko uređenje Bosne i Hercegovine, a i RS-a zajedno s njom, odavno bi bilo stvar prošlosti. No vrhuška, izgleda, za to nema vremena, zaokupljena je pljačkom i uzurpacijom vlasti i javnih dobara.

Najveća kratkoročna opasnost od ovog referenduma može biti samo ta da će Dodikova hobotnica ostati na vlasti u najvećim opštinama u RS-u. Ali, dugoročniji rizik krije se u činjenici da svaka predizborna tenzija ostavlja dugoročne posljedice i po unutrašnju stabilnost Bosne i Hercegovine, i po regionalnu stabilnost, a obje su više nego uslovljene geopolitičkim interesima i potezima velikih.

Šta je stvarni cilj referenduma i da li je on 'domaći' proizvod, ili ima svoje pomagače sa strane?

- Naglasio bih da svaka predizborna međuetnička i ultranacionalistička tenzija u Bosni i Hercegovini, bez obzira koliko se tu radilo o jednokratnom političkom marketingu, ugradi jednu ciglu mržnje i razdora između građana u Bosni i Hercegovini, devastira politički i državnički prostor Bosne i Hercegovine i obezbjeđuje truli status quo sa neizvjesnim posljedicama u budućnosti. Objektivno gledano, nikakav Dodikov potez, ko god da ga podržava i pomaže, ne može dovesti do disolucije Bosne i Hercegovine, ali može dovesti do unutrašnjih sukoba.

Dodik i SNSD, kao, uostalom, gotovo svi nacionalno ostrašćeni političari u RS-u, pa i oni opozicioni, definitivno imaju istu dugoročnu strategiju, a to je strategija odugovlačenja i izmaranja. Dodik radi odličan posao u konstantnom podgrijavanju zamrznutog konflikta, u održavanje trulog statusa quo u Bosni i Hercegovini i u potpunom zaustavljanju Bosne i Hercegovine na putu euroatlantskih integracija. U tome im zdušno pomažu diplomatske i obavještajno-bezbjednosne strukture Rusije i, naravno, vladajuća elita u Srbiji. Naročito onaj još uvijek živi dio srbijanske političke i intelektualne elite koji je stajao iza Miloševićeve agresije na Hrvatsku i Bosnu i Hercegovinu i iza genocida nad nesrbima, a radi zaokruživanja ""vjekovnog srpskog grunta"".

Te iste snage, uz pomoć Rusije, rehabilituju [Slobodana] Miloševića i skidaju sa sebe svaki vid odgovornosti za zločine i agresiju u Bosni i Hercegovini i Hrvatskoj i prekrajaju ovu najbližu istoriju. Kao da umivaju Srbiju za neke nove sukobe - naravno, tuđim tijelima, po tuđim gloginjama. Mogu vam reći da su i Dodik i kompletna politička scena u RS-u i Srbiji postali superverzirani za vođenje prikrivene ultrancionalističke kulturne politike, mimikriju, skretanje pažnje i izmaranje protivnika. Opozicija u RS-u se svojom pasivnošću i izlivima patriotizma, rusofilstva ili četništva odlično uklapa u tu strategiju, jer kad Dodik ode, svi će ga zaboraviti a neko drugi će nastaviti sličan put, samo drugim stilom i u drugom kontekstu.

Postoje pokreti kao naprimjer ""Pozitivna Srpska"" u RS-u i ""Treća Srbija"" u Srbiji koji se izdaju za neke urbane cool likove, mnogo obrazovane patriote zainteresovane za ekonomski napredak, neutralnost i spremne za saradnju sa drugim etnijama, a ustvari se radi o finansijskim manipulatorima i prikrivenim nacionalistima koje finansira srbijansko-ruski fond ""A. M. Gorčakov"". Mislim da tragove strategije ne treba tražiti u ovakvim supervrućim događajima kao što je referendum, jer oni imaju sasvim drugu namjenu.

Proruske organizacije u RS-u i naoružavanje

Tragove dugoročne strategije treba tražiti u činjenici da u RS-u trenutno aktivno djeluje preko 50 različitih srpskih ultranacionalističkih organizacija i ekstremističkih grupa, rusofilskih organizacija, fondacija, bratstava i pokreta, koji okupljaju na hiljade simpatizera i članova, od četničkih organizacija i pokreta SNP 1389 do fonda ""A. M. Gorčakov"".

Prisutno je preko 20 proruskih, a srpskih ultranacionalističkih medija, od Ruske reči i Pravde do Večernjih novosti. Mnogi dolaze iz Srbije, ali ima i orginala iz RS-a. Dobar dio njih se finansira iz tokova novca čiji izvori se mogu pronaći u Srbiji i Rusiji, ili u ruskim fondacijama koje podržavaju rusku diplomatiju, obavještajni rad i interese u inostranstvu. Ili u činjenici da se policija RS-a intezivno naoružava i vatrenim oružjem i komunikaciono-prislušnim uređajima i da su obavještajno-bezbjednosne veze između policije RS-a i Srbije takve da se tu praktično radi o jednoj službi. Najveći investitori u RS-u su Rusija i Srbija, i to u sektoru energetike, telekomunikacija i rudarstva.

Ja, opet, smatram da sve to, zajedno sa predizbornim podgrijavanjem međuetničkih tenzija, još uvijek nije dovoljno za neku veću destabilizaciju Bosne i Hercegovine, ali da li neko može garantovati šta će biti za pet ili deset godina?

Jedna od namjena ovog referenduma jeste i ta da se ispita ozbiljnost, sigurnosni i državnički kapacitet i reakcija elite u Sarajevu. I, naravno, pokazalo se da je njihova reakcija presmiješna. Dijelom zbog njihove očigledne nesposobnosti, a dijelom zbog vlastite koruptivne i kriminalne pozadine i bogaćenja. Očigledan primjer za to su indicije za ozbiljni kriminal glavnog tužioca Tužilaštva Bosne i Hercegovine, ili, pak, ono što po Sarajevu radi bračni par Izetbegović. Da se u Sarajevu zaista vodi državnička politika, državni tužilac bio radio svoj posao, a onda odavno ne bi bilo Dodika na sceni, ali ni Bakira, ni Sebije [Izetbegović], ni [Dragana] Čovića, ni [Amira] Zukića i inih.

Elita u SDA bi voljela da presiječe granu na kojoj zajedno sjedi sa Dodikovom i Čovićevom, ali da oni nekako ne padnu. To će teško da bude. Time vrhuška SDA ugrožava budućnost Bosne i Hercegovine, možda i više i dugoročnije nego Dodikovi psihotični izlivi ljubavi prema RS-u i takozvanim Srbima.

No, mislim da su građani u Sarajevu, Tuzli, Mostaru i drugdje u Federaciji Bosne i Hercegovine po tom pitanju osvješćeniji i kapacitiraniji nego u Banjoj Luci i RS-u, i to su pokazali kroz proteste i na mnogo drugih načina. Naravno, elita u SDA pokušava i njih sve da sveže u jedinstveni bošnjački tor, kako je Dodik svezao građane RS-a u srpski tor, ali mislim da će taj bračni par na kraju proći kao i par Čaušesku. Jer, to što SDA vrhuška radi Bosni je presramotno i presmiješno i takvim ponašanjem ne mogu se izboriti sa Dodikovom separatističkom i nacionalističkom politikom. I oni su toga svjesni i zato stalno prozivaju Ured visokog predstavnika i ponavljaju mantru da OHR treba da reaguje, jer time skidaju sa sebe političku odgovornost, koja objektivno i isključivo leži na njima, kao političarima koji kažu da su bh. patriote.

Kako u svemu ovome gledate ulogu međunarodne zajednice, odnosno Vijeća za provedbu mira, koji se, koliko vidimo, po ovom pitanju drži po strani?

- Isto bismo to mogli reći i za glavnog tužioca Tužilaštva Bosne i Hercegovine, Obavještajno-bezbjednosnu agenciju, Državnu agencije za istrage i zaštitu... Mislim da se OHR ovdje neće miješati, niti reagovati oficijelnim mjerama koje ima na raspolaganju. Prvo, time bi OHR dao na značaju Dodiku, ali bi i amnestirao vrhušku SDA i institucije Bosne i Hercegovine od njihove političke dužnosti i odgovornosti na uspostavljanju pravne države koja će imati kapacitete da reaguje na kriminalne i protivustavne radnje svih.

Također, [visoki predstavnik međunarodne zajednice u Bosni i Hercegovini Valentin] Inzko nije kapacitet diplomate koji će preuzeti inicijativu i lobirati, on je ovdje na radnoj rehabilitaciji, a s druge strane, PIC neće imati dovoljan pritisak iz SAD-a, niti jednoglasnu podršku svih članica Upravnog odbora za neke ozbiljnije mjere prema Dodiku i vrhuški SNSD-a.

Traženje jednoglasne podrške svih članica PIC-a zahtijeva teško trgovanje i pregovaranje SAD-a sa Rusijom, a mislim da je sada, u jeku američkih izbora, i sa trenutnom geopolitičkom situacijom, to gotovo nemoguće.

Drugim riječima, ako ajnštajnima u Bosni i Hercegovini do sada nije bilo jasno da niko sa strane neće praviti i štititi državu Bosnu i Hercegovinu umjesto bh. političara i građana, neka im to bude jasno sada. I zašto bi neko sa strane štitio državu čiji lideri je pljačkaju, a opljačkano bogatstvo kriju u inostranstvu? Osvijestite se i počnite raditi svoj posao prije nego počnete prozivati druge na odgovornost.

Da li smatrate da će OHR, osim verbalno, reagirati i na drugi način, odnosno upotrijebiti ovlasti koje ima, i da li, po Vama, trenutna situacija zahtijeva neku vrstu intervencije i kakvu?

- Mislim da situacija zahtijeva hitnu smjenu iskompromitovanog glavnog tužioca te profesionalan i ozbiljan angažman Tužilaštva Bosne i Hercegovine i SIPA-e na momentalnom hapšenju i procesuiranju Dodika, ne zbog referenduma, već zbog silnih afera koje se vuku za njim i njegovom koruptivnom hobotnicom. Sa Dodikom i njegovih 20 igrača u bijegu ili u pritvoru prije ovih izbora nema tog referenduma koji će na izborima spasiti SNSD i njihove satrape. Time će se otvoriti mogućnost za obaranje Vlade RS-a i postavljanje prelazne vlade do novih redovnih izbora, ili do promjene zakona i vanrednih izbora.

OHR i međunarodni faktori bi tu trebali dati forenzičku i krivičnopravno pomoć bh. mehanizmima pravne države i umanjiti štetni medijski i diplomatski uticaj Rusije. A to znači i osigurati da srpski ekstremisti i proruski trabanti u RS-u i Bosni i Hercegovini ne proizvedu neko nasilje zbog Dodikovog hapšenja ili, pak, bijega iz zemlje. Sve ostale paušalne intervencije, odlaganja i retorička nadmudrivanja su protiv interesa građana i države Bosne i Hercegovine.

Dodikove avanture

S druge strane, situacija je takva da od građana RS-a traži veliku mudrost, a ta mudrost bi značila da građani u što većem broju bojkotuju i ignorišu ovaj i sve druge slične referendume koje im podmeće korumpirana elita. Ovim refrendumom SNSD-ova nacionalistička politika želi uvući građane u svoje kriminalne i nepotrebne odluke i time kolektivizirati nešto što je politički hir i koruptivni interes pojedinaca.

Ljudi koji sebe doživljavaju kao Srbe treba da znaju da će učestvovanjem u Dodikovim avanturama na svoja pleća navući još jedan teret pogrešnih političkih odluka koje su ih itekako koštale u bliskoj prošlosti. Time će se poistovjetiti sa jednim zločinačkim i pljačkaškim režimom i sami sebe targetirati za tuđ račun. Žalosno je da je i opozicija u RS-u pristala na tu igru. Kolektiviziranje jedne takve, u suštini stupidne, odluke neminovno vodi ka kolektivitziranju odgovornosti za sve buduće posljedice takve odluke. Da li građani u RS-u žele takav teret staviti na živote i budućnost svoje djece?

Singer Center, the women’s facility on Rikers Island. I was only there 58 days, but it was long enough to experience and witness firsthand almost every form of abuse that has since surfaced in the news — and much more that hasn’t yet.

Last month, the U.S. Justice Department reached an agreement with New York City to employ “sweeping operational changes to fix a broken system and dismantle a decades-long culture of violence.” It requires the jail system to develop new use-of-force protocol, install thousands of additional surveillance cameras and improve staff selection and review practices. It also calls for higher standards of safety and supervision for adolescents, including restrictions on (and the eventual phasing out of) punitive segregation.

I agree with The New York Times editorial board that the reform package is an “important first step.” Had I not been there myself, I’d probably also agree with what its headline suggests: that reforming the abusive relationship between guards and inmates would effectively “[end] the Rikers nightmare.” I wish that were true, but the possibility of being beaten, raped or murdered by guards was just the beginning of the abuse I faced at Rikers. I learned that even if the reforms do work, the “culture of violence” at Rikers will persist.

The night before I left Rikers, the women of my dorm (4 East A, 800 Building) drafted a plea for basic decency, a list of demands to address the nightmare of “Rosie’s” — the nickname for the women’s facility. I promised them I’d do everything in my power to make their voices heard. When I was released on July 2, 2014, I read their demands aloud at a press conference in front of the welcome sign at Rikers; I repeated them in The New York Times and circulated a petition calling on Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York City Corrections Commissioner Joseph Ponte to end human rights abuses in their jails. Nearly 14,000 people signed on and several elected officials endorsed it, but our demands went unanswered. So on Aug. 15, I returned to Rikers with a busload of supporters to deliver the petition to the commissioner myself. He didn’t show up, but after photos of the drug dogs and the bomb squad surrounding us surfaced on Twitter, Robin Campbell, the spokesperson for the city’s Department of Correction, agreed to set up a meeting (in exchange for my leaving right away).

On Aug. 25, I sat down with Campbell, Ponte and Deputy Commissioner Erik Berliner at the DOC headquarters in Queens. I told them about my friend Judith, who went into Rikers with a liver problem and died from negligent medical care; about the overly invasive gynecologist who convinced me that I might have cancer and unnecessarily cut into my cervix, after refusing to provide me with birth control (my attempt to avoid getting pregnant if raped by a guard) without a pap smear, despite my having signed over medical records to prove I’d had one recently; about the psychiatrists who refused me the ADHD medication I’d relied on for 13 years, the withdrawal that nearly drove me crazy, and Buspirone, the anti-anxiety pill they prescribed that made me lose my memory; about the alarming number of women on liquid Methadone to treat symptoms of narcotics withdrawal, but the minimal programming to help them stay clean.

Commissioner Ponte thanked me for my insight and even invited me to continue advising on necessary changes. I’d like to offer that advice now: The culture of violence at Rikers runs far deeper than the guards, and begins well before they beat us. As long as jails continue to be dumping grounds for the impoverished, the mentally ill and the chronically addicted, you cannot continue to neglect the ailments that inmates come in with — you have to treat them. Otherwise, it’s abuse."

Martin O’Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — faced protests during a town hall discussion at the liberal Netroots Nation conference in Phoenix. The Black Lives Matter campaign, which is effectively merging online and offline activism against racial injustice, staged a demonstration in the conference hall, asking the candidates, Which side are you on?

Initially, O’Malley handled the protest well, even tapping his hands to the rhythm of a song the group sang and starting his remarks by answering questions about criminal justice and police reform. But he fumbled, inviting boos from the majority white progressive crowd when he said, “Black lives matter, and white lives matter, and all lives matter.” He should have known that the phrase “black lives matter” is part of an attempt to eradicate the racist and structural inequalities in the criminal justice system, which so often manifests as police brutality and other state-sanctioned violence. Hence, the emphasis upon black lives.

Sanders, whose appearance followed O’Malley’s, was given a rehearsal and a series of talking points by two Black Lives Matter activists who took the stage during the protest — Tia Oso and Patrisse Cullors. But clearly unmoved, he stepped off on the wrong foot by gesturing to the protesters and the audience to settle down so that he could get to “some serious things” he wanted to address, as if their questions were a mere frivolous disruption from the major issues facing the United States. He then proceeded to give his prepared campaign speech and threatened to leave if the audience “did not want him” to be there.

The incident, which followed a well-received keynote address by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren a day earlier, laid bare a major political divide among white progressives and may now serve as the foundation for challenging other 2016 presidential contenders.

Unlike the two candidates, Warren did not simply recite the phrase “black lives matter”; she effortlessly connected the fight for racial justice with the struggle for economic justice in this country. “It shouldn’t take a revolution on YouTube to drive a revolution in law enforcement,” she said. “It shouldn’t take a hurricane in New Orleans or a massacre in Charleston for Americans to wake up to what is happening — what is still happening — to people of color in this country.”

Sanders maintains that the rise of “the billionaire class” is the key problem facing the United States today. And he believes that racial injustice is an outcome of economic injustices and will be solved only through an economic revolution. Racism is not simply a byproduct of class oppression and economic exploitation. Race and class are inextricably linked to the institution of slavery and, thus, the rise of capitalism in the United States, which dehumanized and objectified black lives by separating families and creating race-based, structural inequalities with clear economic outcomes.

In this regard, the Black Lives Matter protest was a teachable moment for everyone, particularly for white progressives. White progressives need to address racial injustice by picking a side. Will they be Warren progressives, who incorporate racial justice and economic justice? Will they be Sanders progressives, who prioritize economic justice as the cause of racial injustice? Or will progressives create an even better platform than what either of these politicians has articulated? Their answers are critical to shaping the conversation and electoral agenda in 2016."

The clashes began after dozens of Jewish settlers backed by Israeli security stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Palestinians oppose efforts by far-right Jewish groups who want to divide the holy site and build a Jewish temple there.

Palestinians in Jerusalem’s Old City say they have no one to safeguard their basic human rights. They are asking for an international force to protect them. On Oct. 24, the Jerusalemite Women’s Coalition, a group of women’s rights organizations and feminists, called for international protection, citing increased violence by Israeli settlers and the Israeli army. It is urging the international community to defend Palestinians living in East Jerusalem.

“We, the women of occupied East Jerusalem, are politically orphaned,” the group said in a statement. “Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem have been abandoned, subject to the discriminatory policies of a violent state and its security and police apparatus.” The Palestinian Authority cannot protect them in East Jerusalem, and Israel looks out only for the safety of the Jewish community.

Some Palestinian analysts have also called for an international force to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories. “﻿It will ensure that lives are placed above politics and defend a besieged population nearing its 50th year under brutal occupation,” Diana Buttu and Nadia Hijab wrote in The Nation last month. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, has similarly called on the Security Council to provide protection for Palestinians in the Old City.

The feeling of estrangement and displacement is not limited to East Jerusalem. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupation, settlement expansion, political repression, collective punishment and denial of access to places of worship have brought Palestinian society to a tipping point.

Palestinians are increasingly becoming fed up and hopeless. “If you are suffocating someone with a pillow, you cannot expect that person to passively welcome asphyxiation,” Vijay Prashad, the director of International Studies at Trinity College, wrote in Counterpunch last month, referring to Israel’s treatment of the Palestinian people.

Despite the mounting Palestinian causalities, the U.S. media and lawmakers have focused mostly on the violence against Israelis and blame the violence on Palestinians. On Oct. 28, Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., introduced a bill, backed by 50 members of Congress, “expressing solidarity with the people of Israel in the wake of recent terrorist attacks and condemning the Palestinian Authority for inciting an atmosphere of violence.” The move echoes the Israeli government’s public statements on the latest Palestinian uprising."

For Gaza’s beleaguered residents, none of this is surprising. Gaza is already uninhabitable and has been on a fast track to a complete collapse. The U.N. issued similar warnings three years ago, even before last summer’s 50-day war, which left more than 2,200 Palestinians dead and countless others injured — most of them civilians.

“Three Israeli military operations in the past six years, in addition to eight years of economic blockade, have ravaged the already debilitated infrastructure of Gaza,” the latest U.N. report said. “The most recent military operation compounded already dire socioeconomic conditions and accelerated de-development in the occupied Palestinian territory, a process by which development is not merely hindered but reversed.”

Among many things, the report cited the degradation of basic water, energy, sanitation and education facilities and the region’s intense overcrowding as factors that may render the tiny enclave uninhabitable by 2020.

But is anyone listening?

In October 2014, a donor conference hosted by Egypt and Norway pledged nearly $5.4 billion to the Palestinian Authority — $1 billion more than some estimates of the damage from the war. But just $3.5 billion was for Gaza, and more than 25 percent of that sum was committed to prewar projects. Only 8 percent, or $338 million, of the new funding has been disbursed. (Two of the biggest donors, Saudi Arabia and Qatar — which pledged $1.5 billion for Gaza — disbursed only 10 percent of their share.)

Donor fatigue has left Gaza’s reconstruction at a standstill, and there is no political solution on the horizon. After three wars in the tiny strip, one of the few certainties in Gaza is another war within a few years.

Nearly 80 percent of Gaza’s approximately 1.8 million people rely on aid agencies for daily sustenance. Unemployment is at 40 percent, more than double the level 15 years ago. Before last year’s war, nearly 60 percent of the population was food insecure, 95 percent of Gaza’s water is unfit for drinking and electricity is available for only a few hours a day.

This is why 2020 is a generous estimate. Gaza may experience an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe long before that date. However, despite the absence of any imaginable political solution, no one is paying attention to the desperation in the Gaza Strip. Media attention remains focused on a diplomatic agreement with Iran and the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean. This ensures that residents of the besieged territory will have to find other ways to garner the world’s attention again, including militancy."

It will rewrite the rules that affect how about 40 percent of the global economy does business, with the intent of increasing trade and investment. The White House released the agreement’s text to the public yesterday.

Much discussion regarding the TPP has focused on the absence from the pact of China, the largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region. President Barack Obama has portrayed the exclusion as an attempt by the U.S. and its allies to “write the rules” in the region before China does. But this kind of antagonism does nothing to push U.S.-China relations — perhaps the most important bilateral relationship in the world — toward anything productive. The increasing anti-China rhetoric that has accompanied the Obama administration’s Asian pivot will result in fewer opportunities to partner on major global initiatives and hurt both nations economically.

While the U.S. and China have cooperated on a number of important issues, including a notable recent agreement on climate change, geopolitical tensions persist. President Xi Jinping, who has led China since 2012, has pushed for a new brand of nationalism that emphasizes the projection of Chinese power in Asia. This has gotten China into territorial disputes with its neighbors, which in turn have looked to the U.S. for help. China’s periodic alignment with Syria, Iran and Russia has set it at odds with the Obama administration’s strategy in the Middle East. Finally, Washington has serious concerns about Chinese cyberattacks on U.S. businesses.

Given all this, China’s ruling Communist Party has been very nervous about the TPP from the beginning. The Obama administration is selling the TPP to Congress and to the United States’ international partners as an opportunity to get a jump on China in writing global trade rules. The TPP includes China’s neighbors and major trading partners such as Japan and Australia, and the Chinese leadership is worried about losing regional influence.

On the other hand, moderate voices in China such as Long Yongtu, who negotiated China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, have viewed the TPP as a possible way to encourage the Chinese leadership to carry out systemic reforms. For instance, the TPP contains clauses regarding the environment that could influence Chinese policies in a progressive manner. He even argued in 2014 that the TPP would have to include China “sooner or later.” But the Obama administration’s domestic considerations have eclipsed this possibility, as it uses China as a foil to persuade Democrats and Republicans to accept the accord."

At the National Restaurant Association’s annual trade show you could check out workshops such as “Pickle Your Fancy” and “You Bacon Me Crazy,” while mingling with some of the other 63,000 attendees. Though the annual trade show is the NRA’s most public moment, the group works year-round behind the scenes, influencing politicians and legislation to shape what we eat, how we eat it and how restaurant workers — including those employed by McDonald’s — are treated.

As trade show participants, including those from some of the biggest restaurant chains in the country, were closing up their display cases, McDonald’s annual shareholder meeting was just getting started. It would appear to be no coincidence that the trade association’s meeting was timed to coincide with the Golden Arches confab of shareholders — McDonald’s is one of the trade association’s generous corporate sponsors.

But in recent years, McDonald’s annual meeting has become a venue not just for corporate officials opining on official sales reports, but also for public-interest advocates taking the fast-food chain to task for contradictions between what the company says it values and what it does in practice.

McDonald’s NRA membership makes its recent professed concern for its workers ring hollow. The trade group has actively lobbied for years against improving conditions for restaurant workers, including better worker wages and benefits. As one of the NRA’s largest dues-paying members, McDonald’s supports such lobbying and benefits from its success.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA lobbies on “virtually every issue affecting the restaurant industry.” In 2013 alone, the NRA, a tax-exempt, non-profit organization, spent a total of $71 million, including on lobbying and campaign contributions.

In 2014, it spent $3.9 million on contributions to candidates and lobbying 89 separate bills, according to its disclosures. Some of these efforts included longstanding lobbying against health care reform and increases in the minimum wage. The NRA specifically lobbied against policy proposals such as the “Forty Hours is Full-Time Act,” which would give those who work 30 hours a week the same benefits as those who work 40 — especially important today as business owners reduce hours per week to minimize their responsibilities for providing benefits such as health care. (Michele Simon documented more of these lobbying efforts in an Al Jazeera America column last year.)"

The new dolls were released in hopes of revitalizing traditional Barbie’s uniform look (white, blonde and thin) and anemic sales, and, despite not doing anything particularly new, they got a lot of press.

Over the last two decades a kind of limited enlightenment has crept into marketing efforts aimed at women and girls. The Body Shop launched the zaftig Ruby doll in 1997 as part of its “Love your body” campaign, which was prompted by that company’s plummeting US sales. Dove, a Unilever brand, launched its Campaign for Real Beauty in 2004. According to Dove, that campaign “started a global conversation about the need for a wider definition of beauty.” (Starting in the late 1990s, Dove’s beauty bar was described in ads as being “for the beauty that’s already there.”) In December 2015, the editor-in-chief of Women’s Health banished the phrase “bikini body” from the magazine’s cover.



Reading about the new curvy Barbie, I couldn’t help wondering why she is still thought of as the toy for girls. Why not encourage girls to play with a wider range of toys—including dolls, if they want to, but also chemistry sets and tools and building blocks? Even Legos—perfectly gender-neutral, in theory— have in recent years courted controversy due to silly, sexist marketing campaigns (in the early 90s, around age 9, I wrote a letter to the Lego company protesting their rollout of pink Legos for girls).

Marketing executives claim that women have more and better choices today than ever before, and that’s probably true. Many brands in the United States have caught up with social and cultural trends in the last twenty years. They have realized that “diversity and inclusion” and “women's empowerment” are not just corporate buzzwords; they are real concepts that can be mined to move product. Just listen to these companies’ language.

From Dove: “[Our] brand is rooted in listening to women.” (Swoon! Tell us more!) From Mattel: “Girls everywhere now have infinitely more ways to play out their stories and spark their imaginations through Barbie.”

Few would object to the stated messages of these campaigns and marketing strategies: bodies come in different sizes; real beauty is within; a woman’s body is “bikini-ready” when she puts a bikini on it. And they certainly expand consumer choices. But are they actually transforming the world for women and girls?

I spoke to one mother of a teenage girl who described Mattel’s new campaign as “a baby step in the right direction” but “not nearly enough.” She said she knows from her own experience and from her daughter that “girls will find ANY reason to be down on their faces and bodies, so the more variety we can put into dolls, the better!” It’s a fair point. As a recovering teenage girl myself, I remember how harsh I was about what I perceived as my many physical flaws, and how easily I transmitted that anxiety to my younger female cousins."

Its story of stagnation should be familiar to all. For 80 percent of Americans, average incomes fell between 2003 and 2012. That’s every taxpayer with income of less than $85,440 in 2012. As depressing as that news is, the real story from the report concerns the very top level of income earners. The biggest income gap in America is not between the top 1 percent of earners and the 99 percent below them, but rather within the top 1 percent, where the split between the have-mores and the have-a-lot-mores is a fast-widening chasm. Nearly 1.4 million households are in the top 1 percent income group, a statistical cohort whose members change somewhat from year to year. But for the first time ever, the IRS offers a close look at the top .001 percent of taxpayers. It shows that incomes in this rarefied air — the top 1,361 households — are soaring while their tax burdens are falling. The differences in income-growth rates from 2003 to 2012 between the top .001 percent and the rest of the top 1 percent are akin to watching a race to the skies between a helium balloon and a rocket. I analyzed the report to compare the 99.9 percent in the top 1 percent to the one in a thousand above them. Adjusted for inflation, average incomes for 99.9 percent of those prosperous households rose to almost $1.3 million in 2012, up $424,000 over 2003. As big as those numbers are, they pale next to the income growth among the one-in-a-thousand households above them on the income ladder. Those 1,361 households enjoyed an average income of $161 million, an increase of $84.6 million. Here’s a simple way to put that in perspective: Think of the top percent having an income ladder with a thousand steps. On the lowest rung stand those making $434,600 in 2012. On the 1,000th rung are 1,361 very lucky families. For each household on the first 999 steps that gained one dollar those on the very top step got $200. The top one-in-a-thousand households captured an astonishing 21 percent of the group’s income gains. Ponder that for a moment: One in a thousand households in the top 1 percent got more than a fifth of all the increased income.

Perverse tax burdens

Keep in mind that reality is even worse than what the report shows. Researchers at the IRS Statistics of Income division looked at more than 136 million tax returns. They ignored nine million tax returns filed by dependents, primarily children with jobs or trust funds. That means the IRS analysis understates household incomes at the very top, where trust funds are common.

The top .001 percent paid just 17.6 cents out of each dollar they earned in federal income taxes.

Also, don’t forget that many of the very richest Americans show little or no income on their annual tax filings because they borrow against their wealth, paying interest at about one tenth of the tax rate on long-term capital gains. Looking at tax burdens adds another element illustrating how government policy is helping those the very top add to their fortunes will the middle class must contend with falling incomes and rising income tax burdens. The top .001 percent paid just 17.6 cents out of each dollar they earned in federal income taxes. Because of another report, we know that the best-off of that group, the top 400 taxpayers, whose income averaged $335 million in 2012, paid just 16.7 cents on the dollar in income taxes. That means the next 1,000 best-off households (961 to be precise) paid more — 19 cents on the dollar. Now consider the top 1 percent except for those 1,361 households at the very top. The rest of the 1 percent bore a tax burden of 23.5 cents on the dollar. That means their burden was a third higher than the very top households. To get an idea of the difference in income between those among the top 1 percent who bore a high tax burden compared to the one in a thousand at the top consider this: On average everybody else in the top 1 percent worked all year to earn what those 1,361 households earned every three days, and yet those at the top were far less burdened by taxes. Indeed, thanks to Congress, which sets the tax rates and rules, people making $250,000 in 2012 paid 18.6 cents on the dollar. So they paid nearly 2 pennies more on each dollar of income than those at the very top whose average income was about $441,000 each day.

They organized vigils, launched a successful nationwide canned food drive to feed the homeless in their honor and continue to do other great work in their memory. But just two months earlier, when 15-year-old Somali Muslim Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein was brutally murdered in Kansas City, Missouri, as he left his mosque, there was no collective outrage over his death — no vigils, no call to service in his memory, no op-eds asking for justice in national outlets.

In April, as public anger in Baltimore spiked over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, the Islamic Society of North America framed the mostly peaceful protests as devolving into “wanton destruction, thievery, looting and arson.” Although the group updated its inaccurate statement after a handful of American Muslim writers and activists called foul, the fact that such a long-standing Muslim community institution could be so off base on the continued systemic violence being perpetrated against African-Americans is indicative of a deeper problem that goes far beyond the leadership of any one Muslim organization.

Put simply: South Asian– and Arab-American Muslims have a race problem. To understand the extent of that problem, look no further than how black Muslims are treated in American Muslim communities.

Black Muslims, which include African-Americans and immigrants from African countries, make up nearly a quarter of American Muslims. Yet they are often left out and ignored by their co-religionists. African-American Muslims in particular are segregated out of mosques dominated by South Asian– and Arab-American Muslims. Referring to black Muslims as abed, or “slave,” is commonplace among some Muslim communities, and many South Asian– and Arab-American families discourage if not outright forbid their children to marry them.

None of this is new. American Muslims constitute the most racially diverse religious group in the country, yet there is a long history of intrafaith racism against black Muslims. The roots of this racism are multifaceted. Immigrants from South Asia come to the U.S. with a host of cultural beliefs and remnants of colonial thinking that place a premium on lighter skin. For example, India, home to 180 million Muslims, has a skin-whitening-cream market worth $500 million annually. Immigrants from the Middle East hail from a region whose slave trade commoditized at least 10 million Africans, particularly women, over millennia. Saudi Arabia and Yemen abolished slavery only in 1962, and today, there are frequent reports of abuse and exploitation of African and Asian domestic workers throughout the region."

Observers wondered how closely he would hew to the Murayama statement, the apology for the war given on the 50th anniversary by Japan’s socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, which many saw as a positive step for Japan’s relations with its wartime victims. Reactions to Abe’s statement have been largely glass half-empty. Beijing said, “The apology was a diluted one at best, thus marking only a crippled start to build trust among its neighbors.” “His sincerity has been brought again into question by his refusal to issue a fresh apology of his own,” South Korea’s Yonhap news service said. Headlines around the world announced that Abe failed to apologize. The half-empty view correctly notes vagueness and obfuscation in Abe’s speech. He missed an opportunity to more clearly acknowledge Japan’s wartime rape of the “comfort women” 70 years ago — a practice the New York Times brought to the fore last week with its stunning reporting of horrific sexual slavery by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Such evasiveness will continue to hold today’s Japan back from being recognized as the human rights leader that it is and that the world needs it to be. At the same time, the glass-half-empty characterization ignores the other half of a very interesting glass. It overlooks how Abe deferred to pressures to support Murayama’s interpretation of the past and ignores some remarkable ways in which Abe advanced it. The speech reflects the conflicting views about the war in Japan today and likely Abe’s own conflicting views.

A nod to Murayama

As Abe and his advisers prepared for the 70th anniversary, they faced pressure to uphold the spirit of the Murayama statement. Japan’s people broadly support the 1995 apology, and subsequent conservative governments endorsed it as national policy. On the 60th anniversary of the war’s end, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi — a conservative fond of visiting Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, where numerous alleged war criminals are commemorated — based his address on the Murayama statement. Furthermore, the statement — and historical conciliation more broadly — has the approval of Japan’s close ally the United States and of Japan’s neighbors. Beijing and Seoul urged Abe to include key language from that statement to show Japan’s sustained commitment to remembrance and contrition for the past. Thus the pragmatist in Abe could recognize good reasons not to rock the Murayama boat.

We must not let our children, grandchildren and even further generations to come, who have nothing to do with the war, be predestined to apologize. Shinzo Abe Prime Minister, Japan

Abe’s deference to the Murayama statement was unmistakable. Critics, to be sure, are right in noting that Abe does not want the sustained campaign of introspection and atonement that Murayama, now 91, still recommends. But as Japan scholar Sheila Smith wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations, “Abe included all four phrases from the Murayama and Koizumi statements defined as markers of Abe’s intent.” Beyond this, Abe recalled how in countries that fought Japan, innocents “suffered and fell victim to battle as well as hardships such as severe deprivation of food.” And he said that it is the duty of future Japanese generations to “squarely face history.” He even went further than Murayama in some respects. In an extraordinary passage, Abe thanked other nations, notably including China, for their “tolerance” and welcome of Japan as a partner after the war. Smith argued that Abe did “what no prime minister has done — acknowledged with gratitude the tolerance of the very people Japan harmed most deeply in last century’s war and credited them with his nation’s postwar recovery.” Out of the myriad wartime events Abe might have emphasized in his speech, he recalled how Chinese families took in and raised Japanese orphans. This gesture is all the more meaningful as the security competition between the two countries grows more dangerous. By recognizing not just China’s suffering but its generosity, Abe extended an olive branch. (In response, China’s state-run media promptly flamed Abe’s speech without mention of the conciliatory paragraph. Olive branch rejected.)

But he’s only an extreme example of a iconic American type: the patriot whose love of country is heat-tempered with defection and disavowal.

About that time, Ezra Pound was giving full, baroque expression to more or less the same crackpot philofascism. Not only in the “Cantos,” his epic, but in peculiar tracts with titles such as “Jefferson and/or Mussolini.” His lifelong campaign of bringing about an “American Risorgimento” in poetry and the arts was carried out mostly abroad, first in London and Paris, then in Italy. This most American of poets indeed spent little of his adult life in the U.S., but he did make three return visits. The first was in 1910, to persuade the New York Public Library, then under construction, to change its design. No luck. The second was in 1939, to persuade the U.S. not to enter World War II. Also no luck. The last was in 1945, to stand trial as a traitor for his pro-fascist, anti-Semitic rants on Rome radio. This time, a bit of luck: Robert Frost and other writers organized a campaign that resulted in his spending 13 years in an insane asylum instead of being executed.

It was probably around then that he became fixated on Benito Mussolini. There’s an old photo in which he stands in front of his glass storefront in the Bronx, compact, barrel-chested, mustachioed and furious. That the son of a blacksmith could grow up to be a dictator probably seemed to Pops an inspiring story of real opportunity.

The Great Depression altered his perspective. On the eve of the 1929 crash, he filed for citizenship, identifying his race as “white”; when he was finally naturalized seven years later he labeled himself “Southern Italian,” in a small act of protest.

A proud American who nevertheless kept a picture of Mussolini on his night table, Pops left Naples for New York in 1904, with wife and small children in tow. He moved less for freedom than for fortune; why he thought there was a fortune waiting for an uneducated, middle-aged custom-suit tailor encumbered by a burgeoning family — seven kids by the time they were done — is anyone’s guess. Rumor, propaganda and Horatio Alger, Jr. in cheap translations all probably had something to do with it.

My great-grandfather, “Pops,” gave up everything to move here from Italy because he loved the United States. But sometimes, he also hated this country’s guts.

There is no more ridiculous piece of visual wit than the image of Neil Armstrong saluting the American flag while standing on the surface of the moon.

American patriotism is indeed so often fused with its seditious opposite that the contradiction passes unnoticed. Good ol’ boys who fly the Confederate flag next to the Stars and Stripes are called out for their racism but not their ideological incoherence. They inspire revulsion and outrage but not perplexity. For what could possibly be more American than personal secession — which combines, after all, the original sin of the American Revolution with the mystique of the heroic individual?

The right has no monopoly on this. As a leftist who considers National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden an American hero, I’ll concede that a measure of his appeal for me derives from his subversiveness, from his direct flouting of a president I voted for, twice. Snowden talks about “turnkey tyranny” and I feel patriotic. “We are the nation that produces this kind of individual courage!” I think to myself, not unfatuously.

I find it nauseating when the National Rifle Association wraps itself in the flag while ranting about “jack-booted government thugs.” But I find it stirring, lyrical and inspiring when the unforgettable Mickey Sabbath, a Philip Roth creation, wraps himself in the American flag and pees and masturbates onto his dead lover’s grave. When the cops show up, “Sabbath could easily have tucked himself into his trousers and pulled up the zipper. But he wouldn’t.”

Is this appalling tableau a consecration or a desecration? Or like straight-up flag-burning, a bit of both? I don’t know, but it made me laugh, hard, and it made me proud to be an American.

Patriotic “secession” can take ludic form intentionally or unintentionally. There is no more ridiculous piece of visual wit than the image of Neil Armstrong saluting the American flag while standing on the surface of the moon. In the running for a distant second is the invisible “sculpture” marking the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley, which consists of six inches of bare earth and the words: “This soil and the air space extending above it shall not be a part of any nation and shall not be subject to any entity’s jurisdiction.”

More recently, Dean Kamen, the American inventor and Renaissance man who brought us the Segway, bought an island off the coast of Connecticut and seceded — verbally, at least — from the United States. You might call that a joke, but then you might say the same about the Segway. Still, no one ever questioned Dean Kamen’s patriotism. Why would they? He’s in the tradition of Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison and, for that matter, Elon Musk, who will probably secede from the solar system when he gets to Mars.

While Musk heads for the moon, his former Paypal colleague Peter Thiel is setting keel to breakers to “establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems.” He calls them “seasteads” — the new homesteads, only on massive sea platforms.

Balaji Srinivasan, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is predicting he defines as “an opt-in society, ultimately outside the U.S., run by technology.” In a rambling, exhilaratingly absurd speech at the Y Combinator Startup School, Srinivasan invoked the legacy of the Puritans, the Founding Fathers, Ellis Island, “people leaving pogroms, and in the 20th century fleeing Nazism and Communism,” America as the nation of immigrants and emigrants, and so on, all as the basis for what he proposes as “Silicon Valley’s ultimate exit,” the creation of “new countries” in which warfare becomes software, laws become code, and so on.

Srinivasan’s speech was nuts, but it made a kind of sense. The spirit of American secession lives on, for some. It is not today’s downtrodden, but rather its elite, who are setting out to settle a new world for themselves."

When Syriza took power in January, the troika negotiating with Greece adopted a schizophrenic attitude regarding the discussions. It pushed Syriza until the party backed down on raising the retirement age, hiking VAT rates for most goods and accepting privatizations of key assets such as the Piraeus harbor. It then indicated there would be a deal in the second week of June but came back with even tougher measures, proposing a VAT increase in Greek islands and immediate cuts in pensions while failing to offer Greece much-sought debt relief.

Since then, though, his hand has been forced by relentless backtracking of the IMF in the negotiation process and the heavy pressure his party is under. The Greek economy has been squeezed hard since January, and more than 40 billion euros have left the banking system, in what has been labeled a bank run in installments by the international media. After the announcement, massive lines formed outside banks, and Greeks withdrew an as yet unknown amount of money, prompting the government to impose capital controls with withdrawal limits of 60 euros per day and a shutdown of all Greek banks until at least after the referendum.

This vote has been in the cards for some time. Tsipras did almost the same thing two weeks ago, when he asked opposition ministers in parliament if they would support what the lenders were offering. The answer, of course, was no.

In his speech, Tsipras outlined what the Greek people should expect from the deal offered to them, then called on them to decide if they want to accept the deal the country’s creditors are offering: a hike in value-added tax (VAT) rates for remote areas in Greece, new austerity measures for the already collapsing economy that amount to $13 billion in tax hikes and pensions cuts and a strategy that exemplifies the string of failed bailout programs imposed by the country’s lenders in years past.

This is Tsipras’ masterstroke — a move that will either force a compromise or expose the limits of what can be achieved in the eurozone by an anti-austerity government. But it might also prove his undoing, as the timing and the question itself are evidently contentious.

On June 26, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced an emergency referendum during an special televised announcement. On July 5 the Greek people will be able to vote on whether to accept the harsh fiscal demands of its troika of monitors — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The result may determine whether Greece stays in the eurozone.

Now that the ball is back in Europe’s court, it is high time for the EU to show the world what it wants to be.

The latest two drafts of its bailout proposals seen in the past week were harsher than the terms already in place, demanding the gutting of the pension system and tax hikes that would hit the self-employed hard: 100 percent tax advances (a tax on projected rather than actual earnings, paid in full in advance) and a 26 percent tax for businesses big and small. The country’s creditors will probably offer Syriza another deal along the same lines. But the tactic seems to have run its course or at least shown this is as much as the troika is willing to give. What happens now?

On July 5, Greeks will vote. Many analysts, such as Nick Malkoutzis of MacroPolis, a trusted analysis and commentary website, assume that the referendum will essentially determine whether Greece will stay in the eurozone and that if it does and people accept the latest budget deal, Syriza should resign.

Initially, it seemed that both these assumptions were wrong. What Syriza was essentially seeking here was a democratic mandate to act. The party ran on a platform that promised both an end to austerity and Greece’s continuing membership in the eurozone.

Now the purpose of the referendum isn’t so clear.

Syriza, which in retrospect started from a position that seems far too optimistic, has found that it can’t make good on either of its key promises. If it signs a deal in Brussels that strays too far from its red lines — mainly pension cuts and mass layoffs — it risks letting the party fall apart. It is very likely that not all its legislators would vote for it.

If they don’t and things go down their current path, Syriza could take Greece out of the euro, which would open the party to attacks from all sides.

To their credit, what Syriza and Tsipras are looking for here is guidance from the Greek people, who are essentially being asked to choose between a rock and a hard place.

“The question will be, Will you sign up to the economically illiterate, forever indebted plan offered by the IMF/EU or give us a democratic mandate to resist it, even if they crash our banks?” journalist Paul Mason said. “Whatever you make of this logic sitting outside Greece, it is primed to deliver the “no” camp a victory.”

But it is conceivable that the move has spelled out Syriza’s endgame. The country’s creditors, especially Germany, might opt to make the referendum redundant. And there is only one way to do this: With the banking system now dry of cash and Greek society bitterly divided, a deal that’s only marginally better could be put on the table, with better chances of being passed.

Tsipras will thus either opt for a clean break and stake his future on the outcome of the referendum or cave in to Brussels’ demands. If the referendum turns up a “no” vote, Syriza will likely lead Greece out of the euro. In case of a “yes” vote or if Tsipras opts to sign a new, yet to be determined deal, his government will have to resign. He could well win the next elections on the basis of his humanitarian handling of austerity, but he would no longer be able to play David to Europe’s Goliath.

Now that the ball is back in Europe’s court, it is high time for the EU to show the world what it wants to be. Will it become a punishing entity that can’t tolerate even a moderately Keynesian left-wing government? Or will it embody the “end goal, the purpose of humanity,” as Costas Douzinas, the director of Birkbeck College and one of Syriza’s thinkers recently put it — meaning a return to principles of solidarity and democratic governance?

Syriza has little room to act; Europe doesn’t know what to do. If neither entity can make a decision, then we had best let democracy decide."

2016-02-25 00:00:00,http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/25/the-disabled-models-of-new-york-fashion-week.html,The Disabled Models of New York Fashion Week,[u'Debora Fougere'],"[u'week', u'fashion', u'models', u'runway', u'disabled', u'moda', u'york', u'world', u'modeling', u'model', u'thats', u'ftl', u'madeline']","It is a rare sight at New York Fashion Week: a crowd rising to its feet, loudly cheering a model making his or her way down the runway.

But it happens repeatedly at the FTL Moda shows, an Italian fashion “platform” that brings designers together to show their collections in a kind of cooperative setting. Almost everything about FTL’s shows is, suffice it to say, less than traditional, from the setting, The Angel Orensanz Foundation, a former synagogue turned event space on the Lower East Side, to the clothes.

But especially the models.

Shaholly Ayers is a congenital amputee, born without her right arm. Ayers has been modeling for 10 years and this is her third season walking in an FTL Moda Show. Not surprisingly, realizing her dream has been a bit of a battle, until, she says, she found the right agency. “It’s been really difficult for me to break into the industry,” she said. “I ended up networking, working with makeup artists, and building my own portfolio. I met Global Disability Inclusion, and they really helped escalate my career.”

GDI works with major corporations to make workplaces more disabled-friendly. It now partners with FTL Moda on fashion shows and photo shoots around the world to bring what they call “diversely abled” models into the mainstream.

Models like Madeline Stuart. She’s only been modeling since last April, but has been in near-constant demand. Madeline is 19, from Brisbane, Australia, and has Down Syndrome. Her mom, Roseanne, is her spokesperson, constant companion, head cheerleader and best friend. She says Madeline’s road to the runway wasn’t that hard to navigate. “Last year, she told me she wanted to do modeling,” Roseanne said. “I took her in to get professional photos done, I put them on the internet and they just went completely viral, and then people just started contacting us and asking her to do photo shoots, asking her to advertise products.”

They were contacted by three companies in September, asking if Maddy, as her mom calls her, would work with them. She went with FTL Moda because they seem most determined to make a difference, to promote diversity on the catwalk. “Everything we do is for charity,” she said. “If we align ourselves with commercial products, it has to be a positive thing for women and for people in general.”

Ilaria Niccolini started FTL Moda in 2006 simply to showcase fashion. But as the company grew, she felt it needed to do more. Since 2013, she says, “we have been working to include diversity at the highest level.” They stage their shows in New York, Paris, Milan, Rome and Miami, and starting next season, they’ll be showing in Tokyo. “It used to be more difficult,” Niccolini said. “but now, it’s becoming easier. They’re finally beginning to see that there are a lot of paradigms there that can actually be broken. What was once scary or uncomfortable to see or experience, especially when you just sit down to enjoy a runway show, now they realize that not only is it not scary, but it is also, I would say emotional, it’s pretty, it’s exciting. We just want to make a connection with whoever is sitting there, if it’s an editor or a blogger, it doesn’t matter, we just want to create a strong connection so that everyone can embrace what’s going on.”

That connection is what draws some designers to FTL Moda, as well. Boston-based Josefa DaSilva featured Madeline Stuart on her runway, along with other non-traditional models, saying they fit in perfectly with her design inspiration, healing crystals. “They have been cultivating and teach us to be very loving toward everyone, not just a group of people, but everyone,” she said. “I thought, why not incorporate that in my designs? It’s supposed to be very loving and have compassion for our purpose for everyone in the world. That’s why you saw a lot of models over there who were not traditional models, they were plus size models, they were not that high fashion model that we would see in the industry.”

For models like Madeline, it’s the chance to do something her mother says she was born to do. “Modeling is about walking and looking pretty and posing and Madeline’s been brought up to really love herself,” Roseanne said. “Because I’ve always told her how wonderful she is. There’s no inhibition, there’s no nervousness, nothing. She’s just getting her hair and makeup done and showing the world how to be natural, and she does it so perfectly.”

But, while Madeline will travel the world over the next months, walking runways and posing for pictures, even acting as the face for clothing and makeup companies, her mother insists it isn’t about modeling at all. “Madeline does modeling because that’s her platform and we can raise awareness, so people don’t feel isolated,” she said. “But this is about charity, this is about inclusion, this is about diversity. This is about every parent out there who has a child with a disability that feels like they’re alone. They can see Madeline’s face outside and she’s got just as many opportunities as anyone else. It’s for everyone who’s ever been bullied at school because they feel different. They look at Madeline now and it gives them hope. It’s a vehicle, basically, to get our word out, to try to make the world a better place.”

That sentiment is echoed by most of the models at FTL Moda, including Shaholly Ayers. “As far as I know, this is the only show that has such a diverse group of models,” she said. The first show that I walked in, they had wheelchair models. It’s phenomenal because beauty is in so many looks. They’re able to show that at FTL Moda, and it’s so special to be a part of that.” It’s also, she said, about being a role model as well as a runway model. “I have a lot of followers on my fan pages that are children looking at me and saying, I have someone like me. When I was growing up, I didn’t have that at all. I think people need that.”

According to Niccolini, FTL Moda will continue with its runway schedule, but they’re also moving more into editorials, with upcoming spreads for what she calls top magazines around the world. They will, of course, include diverse models, some using bionics, some wearing prosthetics because, she said, “that’s what the real industry today wants in terms of fashion, art and culture.”

And her pride continues to come from the men and women who are getting a chance to do something they never would have done without FTL Moda — model. “That’s why I strive to make this really beautiful, she said. “What actually inspired me I think is that we are in a world nowadays where there is beauty everywhere, and I think, especially now, with social media, we see more and more often stereotyped images. And instead, there’s so much to see and discover. I think that’s what inspires me, to be able to give voice and give a stage to whoever deserves it.”"

We had just left a rally for Palestinian children killed in Gaza. As I waited alone, a police officer monitoring the rally ordered me to move. I did, stepping back toward the restaurant wall. This was not good enough for him. In seconds, he flipped me, pushed me against the wall, pressed his body on mine and while I was handcuffed, said I was resisting arrest. Photos later revealed his arms bulging with the ferocity of the arrest.

As a lawyer, I have done know-your-rights trainings on this very police tactic: bootstrapping charges to justify arrest. As I was being arrested, I began to repeat in a monotone voice, “I am not resisting arrest,” to which the officer responded, “Shut your mouth.” When I objected to him going through my purse and pulling out my photo I.D., he said, “I can do whatever I want, because you are my prisoner.” At that moment it was true. It didn’t matter that I had been appointed in January 2014 as top counsel to New York City’s public advocate, the first Bangladeshi-American to reach that level of city government and one of few Muslim Americans in the newly elected administration.

The command “Shut your mouth” stuck out for me, because it is symbolic of how our legal and political system views and expects people of color to behave: quietly. Sandra Bland asked why she was being arrested. Asserting her rights as a woman of color to a white male officer was seen as disruptive and met with an aggressive response. Wearing my traditional South Asian tunic, visibly an immigrant, my mere presence was disruptive as well.

I was separated from my family and funneled through the criminal legal system, which black and Latino communities sadly know too well. After 9/11, the Muslim American community experienced aggressive surveillance and policing, by both state and federal authorities. Black Muslims have borne the brunt of both racial and religious profiling.

From precinct cell to central booking to arraignment, I was in custody for nine hours. I observed women who could not afford counsel, barely getting a minute to meet with their under-resourced public defenders, women who could not go home to their children because they could not afford bail or women accepting any plea just to get out. They were forced to negotiate away their rights. One of these women advised me, “Don’t ask for medical attention. You will be in here longer.” So I didn’t, trading away my rights for freedom.

Three months later, I filed a federal lawsuit against the New York Police Department. I entered the courthouse last month not as a lawyer but as the client. The federal magistrate judge reminded me of a federal rule called “offer of judgment,” in which the defendant offers a settlement amount. If I rejected it and a trial produced an outcome that was either equivalent or less favorable, I would bear the costs of the city’s attorney fees. This is a known legal tactic to pressure plaintiffs to settle their cases."

Local governments must now act to establish civilian review boards independent of any police department, with the authority to take action against officers who break the law, appoint special prosecutors with no ties to local police departments to investigate shootings by officers and demilitarize police departments that have become excessively armed, poorly trained paramilitary forces.

Body cameras thus prove themselves to be indispensable. One officer who acted recklessly is facing murder charges, and two other officers who acted out of self-defense won’t be charged. When a police officer is equipped with a body camera, he or she will be more likely to think before pulling the trigger, knowing that his or her actions will be under public scrutiny.

Similarly, the recent shooting of a knife-wielding man in New Hampshire was caught on tape, exonerating the officers who killed him . On July 6, 41-year-old Hagen Esty-Lennon, a former New Hampshire corrections officer — crashed his SUV into a closed bridge, and nearby residents called 911 to report that he was leaving the scene of the crash carrying a knife. When officers arrived, they told Esty-Lennon, who was bleeding from a self-inflicted wound, to drop his weapon and stop advancing toward them. When the man suddenly charged, officer Ryan Jarvis and officer Greg Collins each fired five shots, striking him six times. After reviewing the body camera footage, New Hampshire attorney general Stephen Foster ruled the encounter a justified homicide.

Joseph Deters, the district attorney who indicted Tensing on murder charges, said in a press conference that Tensing’s behavior was “an absolute tragedy.” If it weren’t for the body camera footage, Deters would’ve likely believed Tensing’s story and Tensing would have never had to face a jury for his actions.

On July 19, University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing’s body camera captured footage of his fatal encounter with Samuel DuBose, in which he shot and killed the unarmed young man just minutes after pulling him over for a routine traffic stop. While Ray Tensing’s official report claimed that he was “almost run over” and had to fire his weapon out of fear for his life, his body camera showed him attempting to open DuBose’s door, DuBose holding the door shut and starting the engine, and Tensing shooting him in the head after telling him to stop.

Recent incidents in Cincinnati and rural New Hampshire have shown that the cameras simultaneously hold trigger-happy cops accountable and exonerate police officers who only pulled the trigger when they had no other option. Now, it’s time for local governments to start listening to and implementing further demands of the police-accountability movement.

The grass-roots push to equip police officers with body cameras has been effective: One-third of all police departments now have them , a significant increase since 2013, when the US Justice Department found that 75 percent of surveyed police departments didn’t use the technology.

In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo recently announced that the state’s attorney general would be serve as the independent prosecutor to investigate each shooting by an officer. This is a welcome step forward in a state known for having the nation’s most-sued police department and a largely ineffective civilian review board that relies entirely on the cooperation of the NYPD’s internal affairs bureau.

By contrast, in Ferguson, Missouri, Saint Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch — who came from a family of police officers, usually ruled in favor of police officers, and outright said he would’ve been a police officer if not for a debilitating injury — acquitted Darren Wilson of all wrongdoing. An independent prosecutor is less likely to have a conflict of interest in a case involving a citizen killed by police, and will be more likely to base their decision solely on the merits.

Good models for citizen review boards include Miami and San Diego. Miami has a 13-member board that can launch independent investigations of police misconduct based on citizen complaints, with a budget to hire two investigators and an attorney full-time. San Diego’s civilian review board has 11 members, and two investigators; it can investigate and make policy recommendations. However, each model falls short: Miami’s board can issue subpoenas, but can’t subpoena police officers. San Diego’s board still ultimately has no binding power, as the sheriff has the final say regarding the board’s recommendations. To its credit, the sheriff doesn’t often go against the board’s recommendations, according to the board’s executive director. Ideally, this kind of body should be able to conduct its own investigations of police misconduct, subpoena any public official or police officer in its jurisdiction, and have recommendations go around police departments entirely and straight to the city council for a vote. The police should have no say in whether or not a police officer is held accountable for his or her actions.

The demilitarization of local police departments should be as high of a priority as body cameras. Even as crime rates have gone down, police are arming themselves as if their cities were under attack by ISIL: a front-page graphic from the New York Times in August of 2014 revealed how small, obscure police departments have used existing federal programs to procure equipment meant for war zones. Stephens County, Oklahoma, has a Bell UH-1 Huey helicopter; Benton County, Arkansas, has a mine-resistant, ambush-protected armored vehicle; Collier County, Florida, has M-16 rifles.

Out west, Richmond, California, has proven to be a good example of a responsive police department that keeps its community safe by listening and de-escalating, rather than opening fire. In Richmond, which used to be one of America’s most violent cities, no citizens have been killed by police since 2007. That’s in part because police chief Chris Magnus began a specialized training program in 2006 to encourage officers to reduce their dependence on lethal force, and to use Tasers and pepper spray to subdue perpetrators.

Police in neighboring Oakland, on the other hand, killed 20 citizens and wounded 33 between 2008 and 2013. And even with no trigger-happy cops, the murder rate in Richmond has dropped significantly, due to a unique approach of providing needed resources to at-risk young men and women. While there were 47 homicides in 2009, there only 21 homicides in 2010, 26 in 2011, 18 in 2012, and 16 in 2013.

Police officers are responsible for protecting and serving communities, not maiming and killing civilians. We still have a lot of work to do, but equipping cops with body cameras to stop the reign of police terror across the U.S. is a start. Federal programs that allow surplus military equipment to go to local police departments should be repealed, and existing military equipment in the hands of local cops should be seized by local governments, melted down and used for scrap metal."

The argument is that we used to have all these relatively high paying jobs in manufacturing and other sectors requiring routinized work, which are now being displaced by machines or, in the near future, robots. Pretty soon robots will also be driving our cars, buses and trucks, as the technology for self-driving vehicles becomes cost efficient.

The loss of these jobs is supposed to result in a shortage for workers without sophisticated skills. This means that more workers will be fighting for a rapidly shrinking number of jobs, leading to more unemployment and underemployment and lower pay. On the other hand, the folks who develop and therefore own the technology will be getting rich.

That sounds like a pretty bad story, at least from the standpoint of inequality. The loss of middle class jobs means that fewer people will be in a position to raise a family comfortably. From this perspective, we may try to redistribute income to help out the losers, but the underlying problem is technology, and no one wants to try to stop the development of technology.

Despite its popularity, the story lacks evidence. Productivity growth has been very slow in recent years — the exact opposite what we should expect from robots taking all our jobs. Also, the data contradict the story of disappearing middle class jobs, as opposed to weak job growth overall.

The basic theory behind the argument is even weaker. The problem with its reasoning is that government policy, not technology, determines what it means to “own” the technology.

This point should be straightforward. Technology is simply knowledge. No one inherently owns knowledge. The government gives ownership of technology through patent or copyright monopolies or other forms of intellectual property. These monopolies allow individuals or corporations to sue anyone who uses technology without their permission. Patent infringers can pay large fines and even face jail if they persist.

It is this protection — not the technology itself — that allows those with sophisticated skills to get rich from technology. If we envision robots doing everything in a world without intellectual property, then robots would be incredibly cheap. After all, robots will be producing robots. Robots will be making and driving the trucks that deliver robots, as well as loading and unloaded the trucks.

This means that for a few dollars we should all be able to buy ourselves robots that will clean our house, wash our clothes, cook our meals, mow our lawns and do any other necessary task that we would rather not do ourselves. They should even be able to grow fruit and vegetables for us in our backyard."

It was the first time that he visited Mexico as the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Mexico had been the only major Latin American country he hadn’t visited since he was elevated to the Throne of St. Peter. Mexican political commentators spent months before his visit speculating on the content of his message. Many assumed that he would be especially bold in a country that has known no end to the violence that started with the so-called war on drugs.

Francis is no foreigner to political struggles of minorities and disadvantaged groups. As pope, he has used the power of his office to elevate issues such inequality and climate change on the global agenda. Thus many in Mexico were expecting him to deliver an especially powerful message, given Mexico’s troubled recent history.

It is no secret to outsiders that since 2006, Mexico has been experiencing a slow-motion human rights crisis. During the last 10 years, more than 160,000 people have died in the war on drugs. More than 20,000 people have disappeared. Heartbreaking testimonies can be found all over the country from survivors and family members of those who have been lost. Free press is under attack, and journalists are killed with impunity.

Meanwhile, the Catholic Church in Mexico has gone through a series of scandals. As in the U.S., there have been allegations throughout Mexico of priests who molested children, and Catholic authorities in Mexico did everything possible to protect the priests and shield them from judicial procedures. It appears from journalistic investigations that Pope John Paul II knew about the abuses and did nothing.

Francis found a country that has steadily become less Catholic. While 50 years ago, virtually every Mexican considered himself or herself a Catholic, nowadays, only 4 in 5 Mexicans do so. Catholics in Mexico are mainly clustered in the center of the country, with the indigenous south shifting toward other forms of Christianity. Islam has been on the rise in Chiapas, a largely indigenous state that Francis visited on Monday.

In this context, his Masses in Mexico were largely anodyne. He focused on one of his main talking points, inequality, while skipping any thorny local political issues. On Sunday he flew to Ecatepec, a gray slum on the outskirts of Mexico City that is a representative sample of the half of Mexico’s population living in poverty.

While in Ecatepec, he addressed the country’s glaring disparities and mourned the deaths of those who make the journey to the U.S. at the hands of what he referred to as “dealers of death.” However, his speech and visit largely avoided addressing any controversial topics. In the months before his trip, the parents of the 43 college students from Ayotzinapa who disappeared a year and a half ago asked him to meet with them. He refused to see them, but they were invited to a Mass he held in Juárez, according to Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi."

Florida, a state where more than 16 percent of residents are black, has no black elected prosecutors. In most states that elect prosecutors, none are black. Nationwide, elected prosecutors are 95 percent white, and overwhelmingly male.

These statistics are more skewed than the already-abysmal racial disparities among judges and lawyers. It is hard to think that any part of the law could be more racially exclusive than big law firms, where only 3 percent of attorneys are black, with even that number continuing to drop. But the realm of prosecution is the most white-dominated of all.

These numbers are finally receiving the attention they deserve. The New York Times recently reported on a new study by the Women Donors Network, exposing just how racially exclusive these offices continue to be. The Times quotes criminal justice experts who point out that prosecutors wield an inordinate amount of power, since almost all criminal cases are resolved through plea bargains brokered by prosecutors. Thus, they reason, it is important to make sure district attorneys' offices are not heavily racially skewed, since those offices play a large part in perpetuating racially biased criminal justice outcomes. Wouldn’t adjusting prosecutorial diversity go a long way toward rooting out that racism?

Civil rights activists, too, have pointed out the dearth of black prosecutors. Former NAACP president Ben Jealous has said that because prosecution is a key “lever of power,” having more black prosecutors is essential in order to effect change. Melba Pearson, who heads the National Association of Black Prosecutors, says that unless defendants see “someone who looks like them” when they enter a courtroom, faith in the system is impossible. The authors of the new study emphasize that diversity is important because of the extreme concentration of power in prosecutors’ hands, from the choice as to whether to prosecute, to the ability to strike bargains with witnesses, to the plea process with defendants.

It’s completely correct to say that prosecutors’ extreme power, combined with racial disparity, means white people end up almost exclusively in control over a large part of criminal justice decision-making. But minority representation does not automatically eliminate racism. Focusing on electing black prosecutors would be a mistake for those concerned about race and criminal justice, because the injustices inflicted by prosecutors will not disappear without far deeper change.

To give a parallel example, some of the most brutal and unaccountable police departments in America have a majority black population of officers. The New Orleans police department is 60 percent black — exactly the same as the percentage in the city itself. Yet the department is responsible for countless infringements of civil rights, and a Justice Department investigation found that it consistently “engages in a pattern or practice of discriminatory policing in violation of constitutional and statutory law.”"

He won a hard-fought campaign promising to undo the major elements of “Obamacare” that Kentucky has been a leader in implementing. More than 400,000 people would immediately lose coverage if he follows through with his initial campaign promises.

He is unlikely to do so once he confronts the political and practical realities of taking away insurance from nearly 10 percent of the state’s population. However, even if nothing changes in Kentucky, this election should cause supporters of the ACA to pause and reflect on the status of implementation around the country. They should begin to confront an uncomfortable possibility that Medicaid expansion in all 50 states is not inevitable.

More than 16 percent of Americans lacked health insurance when the ACA was signed into law in March 2010. The uninsured rate has dropped sharply since then, to just 10.4 percent. This is a huge accomplishment, but it still falls short of the law’s full potential.

Nineteen states continue to resist Medicaid expansion, one of the key components of the ACA. The expansion was mandatory until the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out.

Pundits immediately predicted — and continue to predict — that every state would ultimately cooperate. The federal government would pay for 90 to 100 percent of the expansion, allowing state leaders to claim credit for helping their residents while mostly relying on federal money. Hospitals would aggressively push for the expansion, allowing them to receive compensation for treating people who otherwise would never pay.

The number of participating states has steadily increased since 2010. Twenty-five states agreed to expansion by mid-2013. This included states led by Republican governors, including current presidential candidates Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio.

Opposition to expanding Medicaid remains strong, especially throughout the South, where health needs are particularly great. Nearly 4 million more people would be covered if the remaining 19 states cooperated.

Some leaders in conservative states have looked for politically feasible ways to accept the expansion. Mike Beebe, the Democratic governor of Arkansas, led the way with a plan called the private option because it used the federal government’s Medicaid money to allow new enrollees to shop for coverage from a private insurer in the state’s new health insurance exchange.

This approach required a waiver from the federal government — an approach used by both Republican and Democratic administrations to allow states to test new ways to finance and deliver health care benefits to Medicaid enrollees. Four conservative states followed Arkansas by expanding Medicaid in the second half of 2013, including two that used waivers, Iowa and Michigan.

Despite this early momentum, only five states expanded Medicaid in 2014 and 2015. Of these, only New Hampshire and Indiana used waivers. Others are still considering this approach, including Kentucky, as Bevin has hinted he would do after repealing Medicaid expansion. In most states this has required legislative approval. A dying compromise in Utah is an example of how difficult this will be to achieve in conservative states.

Meanwhile, looming deadlines threaten the program in many states that are participating. At the same time as other states began considering the private option, leaders in Arkansas were struggling to keep the program alive. The private option, which was passed by razor-thin margins in 2013, was funded for only one year. Key supporters of the private option lost re-election in 2013, setting the stage for a tough reauthorization fight in 2014. The challenge was compounded by the state’s constitutional requirement to secure a 75 percent supermajority for any bills spending state money."

Did you notice that the much-hyped June 5 deadline for the Greece’s payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came and went, Greece didn’t pay and nobody fell off a cliff? Trust me, this is not a cliffhanger.

Although there have been numerous references to game theory in the ongoing commentary, it’s really not necessary if you look at the revealed preferences of those whom the Syriza government is polite and diplomatic enough to call its European partners. Take partner-in-chief German Chancellor Angela Merkel: If there’s one thing she doesn’t want to be remembered as, it’s the politician who destroyed the eurozone.

Of course, we don’t know if a Greek exit would do that, but there’s a chance that it could. Even if the European Central Bank would be able to contain the resulting financial crisis, it is possible that Greece would, after an initial shock, ultimately do much better outside the euro, which might convince others to want to leave. Whatever the probability of that scenario, Merkel is, like most successful politicians, a risk-averse creature who won’t roll those dice.

And there is an elephant in the room that she is not going to ignore: the United States. There are scattered press reports that Barack Obama’s administration has put pressure on Merkel to reach an agreement with Greece, but the importance of that has been vastly understated. Unless it is a request that could get a German government voted out of office — such as George W. Bush’s bid for support of his invasion of Iraq in 2003 — something that is strategically important to Washington is extremely likely to find agreement in Berlin. And in this case, Merkel and Obama are basically on the same page.

The politics of empire are much more important than any economic concerns here. For the same reasons that the United States intervened in Greece’s civil war (1946 to ’49) and supported the brutal military dictatorship (1967 to ’74) — with all the murder, torture and repression that these involved — Washington does not want to have an independent government in Greece.

Europe is the United States’ most important ally in the world, and Washington doesn’t want to lose even a small piece of it, even little Greece. Everybody knows that if Greece leaves the euro and needs to borrow hard currency for its balance of payments, it will get some from Russia and maybe even China. Greece could leave NATO. Greece could participate in Russia’s proposed gas pipeline project, which would make Europe more dependent on Russia — something that American officials warned against, drawing a sharp rebuke from Greece’s energy minister, who rightfully told them it was none of their business.

It would be nice to think that the worst features of U.S. foreign policy have changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but they have not. The Cold War never really ended, at least insofar as the U.S. is still a global empire and wants every government to put Washington’s interests ahead of those expressed by its own voters. The current hostilities with Russia add a sense of déjà vu, but they are mainly an added excuse for what would be U.S. policy in any case."

Earlier this month, the employees of Gawker Media, one of the earliest and most successful Web-publishing networks, voted to unionize, and create one of the first digital locals for the Writers Guild of America. Seeking to capitalize on this high-profile victory, a group of union activists and labor reporters announced a national organizing push for digital media workers, to be launched at a conference in Louisville, Kentucky, in October.

Longtime observers of yon digital-media revolution know that things weren’t supposed to play out this way. The online media gold rush, like every other form of digital commerce, was supposed to gleefully overturn the old workplace hierarchies of the fast-expiring industrial age. Where fusty, backward notions like group healthcare benefits, retirement plans, and workplace solidarity once reigned, flattened hierarchies, IPO stock options, and casualized free-agent work regimes were now going to take irresistible, spontaneous hold. Let a thousand entrepreneurs — and millions upon millions of sassy listicles and uproarious cat videos — bloom!

So what exactly went wrong? Like most collateral victims of misdirected ambition dating back to ancient Greece, the barons of are falling to their own staggering hubris.

Consider the curious, amply instructive case of Medium.com. The online blogging platform began its publishing life at the behest of Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, who was determined to preserve the perennially beleaguered “long form” model of Web-based journalism. Medium would not pander to the listicle-addled business models of BuzzFeed or mimic the voyeuristic piffle slapped on the front page of the Huffington Post.

In short order, though, Medium’s investors found that journalistic ambition produced disappointing market returns. So the cherished longform ideal was quietly mothballed, and the site began in short order pandering to each and every played-out market-libertarian cliché in the well-worn Silicon Valley playbook. The site has become shorter, snappier—and robustly sycophantic in its portrayals of the prerogatives, whims and general largesse of corporate America.

A near-perfect specimen of the genre appeared this month on Backchannel, the Medium subsite founded by former Wired writer Steven Levy — a practiced courtier of Silicon Valley’s callow-yet-swaggering info elite, and author of the ain’t-Google-grand corporate hagiography “In the Plex.” In his liberationist manifesto, “The Full-Time Job Is Dead,” Kevin Maney, a Levy epigone and budding Web prophet, is here to tell you just how very excellent your future as a free-agent impresario of serial — or better yet, simultaneous! — “micro-careers” is going to be. “Technology is now changing the nature of work,” Maney enthuses — and then we’re docented through a Tomorrowland-style survey of the relevant trends. A new era is upon us, he writes,

in which most of us will work in multiple ‘micro-careers’ at the same time, leaving the traditional full-time job behind. ‘Work’ is likely to turn into a marketplace in the cloud rather than a desk and a chair at a traditional corporation. A free agent workforce will be able to make a good living layering a number of professional relationships, entrepreneurial passions and other money-making pursuits on top of each other.

The great disruption is already under way in the American labor market, Maney contends, in sectors “mostly focused on simple, hands-on work.” Ride-sharing apps Lyft and Sidecar have transformed mere car owners into enviably layered proprietors of their own cabs. AirBnB allows you to turn your domestic domicile into a robust revenue stream. The cloying hipster-crafts portal Etsy “is a market for the handmade skirts you sew while watching ‘Game of Thrones,’” Maney writes in a revealing aside that displays zero knowledge of actual textile work or cable binge-viewing."

The company has since fulfilled 41.3 percent of 290,353 such requests, involving more than 1 million URLs. But Google’s level of compliance was not sufficient for France’s data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), since results were delisted only on European extensions of Google (Google.fr, Google.uk, etc.). In other words, if someone successfully petitioned Google to delist certain links, a search on Google.fr would not turn up that information, but a search on Google.com would. In June the CNIL issued Google an ultimatum: Extend delisting to all domains or face significant fines.

Citing the “chilling effect” of global delisting and echoing commentary from legal quarters about the dangerous precedent of allowing one nation’s laws to govern the whole world, Google announced last week that it would not accede to the CNIL demand.

Why? After all, long before its public squabble with the European Union, Google regularly removed content that contained a person’s Social Security, bank account or credit card numbers from searches, and it readily agreed to copyright-related take-down requests by large corporations such as Disney and Sony.

In truth, Google is not particularly interested in protecting free speech. In 2012 after the legal case that first brought to public attention Google’s conflict with the European right to be forgotten, prominent legal theorist Jeffrey Rosen expressed concerns about Google becoming “censor-in-chief for the European Union.” Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales concurred, worrying that Google may now be legally positioned to decide which parts of history are preserved and which are not.

In the meantime, Google’s public statements about the European ruling and the CNIL demand have been cautious in referring to censorship and free speech interests. This is unsurprising; Google is not merely a neutral pointer to information. Because of the near global monopoly of its search algorithms, Google is a significant determiner of what information Internet users see. Google controls over 90 percent of searches in Europe, 64.2 percent in the U.S. and 88.2 percent worldwide, lending plausibility to the quip “If it isn’t on Google, it doesn’t exist.”

That’s not strictly true, but for most practical purposes, it is. Because the company already effectively controls access to information, it would be more than a little disingenuous of Google to complain that globally complying with the right to be forgotten ruling would take the company into new territory or constitute a major blow to free speech. (And in any event, content excluded from a Google search does not simply disappear; it is just harder to find.)

Nor is Google particularly interested in protecting privacy.

Certainly, the big search engines’ new revenge porn policies seem to be premised on the importance of protecting individual privacy. Google has moved to address the problem of revenge porn, along with Microsoft, recently adding to the list of things it is willing to remove globally “a nude or sexually explicit image or video of you that’s been shared without your consent.”"

The verdict — against two Muslim journalists, 10 activists and six members of the Ethiopian Muslims Arbitration Committee — came after three years of a politically motivated trial whose outcome was long ago determined. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 3. The trial and the verdict against the Muslim leaders is a political spectacle designed to conceal the regime’s reindoctrination campaign and silence long-standing grievances of the Muslim population. The crackdown on Muslim activists is part of the ruling party’s larger crusade against journalists, bloggers, activists and opposition leaders and supporters.

A peaceful movement

The Ethiopian Muslims movement was organized around the community’s three core demands: ending the government’s continued control of the Ethiopian Islamic Affairs Supreme Council, the official Islamic authority in Ethiopia; terminating the controversial reindoctrination of Ethiopian Muslims launched by the government in July 2011; and reopening the Awoliya College, the country’s only Muslim college. Authorities closed the institution in 2011, alleging it had become a breeding ground for radicals. While the government has always controlled the council, it was Awoliya’s closure and the coercive reindoctrination campaign that triggered the confrontation. The government denies allegations of interference and control of religious institutions, but a leaked audio from the initial indoctrination sessions shows that it has invited preachers from Lebanon to introduce Al-Ahbash, a supposedly moderate sect of Sunni Islam, to Ethiopia. Authorities arrested members of the Arbitration Committee in July 2012 after negotiations with the government failed, and they were charged with “intending to advance a political, religious or ideological cause” by force, signaling the impending criminalization of the peaceful movement.

Repressive political ends

Since the disputed 2005 elections and the mass arrests of opposition leaders and journalists, the use of court proceedings for repressive political ends has become one of the signature traits of the Ethiopian government. The primary purpose of these administrative acts disguised as criminal proceedings is the elimination of political opposition and critical voices. These trials function not to adjudicate legal disputes but to remove actors from the democratic sphere. The judicial machinery is set in motion not to determine guilt or innocence but to sustain and consolidate the government’s authoritarian stranglehold on its people. In order to build a coherent narrative, the government often recasts genuine grievances as a national security threat and reconfigures activism as criminal offenses. For example, it accused the jailed Muslim leaders of working in tandem with foreign terrorist groups to destabilize Ethiopia and undo its economic progress. By dramatizing the impending danger and alleged links to regional militant groups such as Somalia’s Al-Shabab and Nigeria’s Boko Haram, the defendants’ prolonged trial was used to create an alternative reality manufactured by the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).

The accused Muslim leaders see their actions as a defense of the constitution and their trial as persecution — a dubious plot to delegitimize their peaceful protests against the injustices of the state.

The government presented various forms of evidence — including documents, audio and video of sermons and speeches by the defendants, witness testimonies and material obtained through surveillance. However, most of the evidence was presented in closed sessions, and the accused were not given adequate opportunities for cross-examination. The government has deployed stealth propaganda to incriminate the defendants. Since the committee members’ arrests, authorities have produced two fake documentaries intended to generate images and narratives of terrorism to scare Christian Ethiopians and Western observers, in flagrant violation of the presumption of defendants’ innocence until proven guilty.

The U.N. views education as crucial to eradicating poverty, building peace and fostering intercultural dialogue, and it remains committed to “a holistic and humanistic vision of quality education worldwide.” Yet there has been a dramatic shift in the U.N.’s educational mission from supporting a well-rounded, humanistic conception of education to one that focuses on teaching children the “hard skills” necessary to participate in the global economy. This turn began with the Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) and has intensified with the Sustainable Development Goals that launch this month. One of the new targets, for instance, is to “increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship” by 2030. The U.N. has thrown its weight behind what Finnish scholar Pasi Sahlberg calls the Global Education Reform Movement (GERM). According to Sahlberg, there is a “global unified agenda” to rebuild educational systems to benefit multinational corporations. GERM began in the U.S. and United Kingdom, and has spread throughout the world. GERM is committed to educational standardization, a focus on literacy and numeracy, high-stakes testing and centralized control of the schools. According to Sahlberg, this movement “limits the role of national policy development” and “paralyzes teachers’ and schools’ attempts to learn from the past and also to learn from each other.” In other words, GERM disempowers communities and educators and forces them to teach a narrow set of skills measured by standardized tests. The U.N.’s sustainable development goals articulate many admirable ideals, including eradicating poverty, combating HIV/AIDS, reducing inequality and ensuring environmental sustainability. According to Sahlberg, preparing students to tackle global problems requires encouraging creativity and experimentation among schools and teachers. While several recent U.N. reports mention teaching critical thinking and protecting human rights, the focus is on helping multinational corporations control, for their own benefit, education systems around the globe. For those who think that this is a problem, the time to protest is now.

Private sector partners

Last fall, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations Private Sector Forum. He supports the U.N.’s goal of universal Internet access because it creates new jobs, lifts people out of poverty and gives millions of children “access to affordable learning tools.” For Zuckerberg, there is a confluence between the U.N.’s education agenda and Facebook’s development of personalized learning platforms. The U.N. maintains that the business community should view the U.N.’s education agenda as a chance to pilot technologies, enter markets, train workers and increase profits. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon makes this pitch in a report entitled “The Smartest Investment: A Framework for Business Engagement in Education.” According to Ban, the business world needs a “skilled, innovative workforce,” and “investing in education creates a generation of skilled people who will have rising incomes and demands for products and services.” The U.N. promises to help corporations “think about how their business policies and practices can impact education priorities.”

The U.N. should recommit to the ideal of humanistic education that recognizes many diverse ways for human beings to learn and to flourish.

First, the report advises business leaders to convince peers to commit to education reform. The report mentions building sustainable societies and saving lives, but the main theme is that the U.N.’s education agenda promotes economic growth and expands business opportunities for companies. For instance, corporations may want to work with the U.N. because “consumers have indicated a willingness to buy — and reward — socially conscious brands.” Next, according to the report, corporations may improve education by funding organizations with a record of social impact, supporting business schools to train education leaders or piloting technology to improve delivery outcomes in remote communities. The report makes little mention of education being an end in itself or a means to transform the world’s economic or political structure. Finally, the report suggests that corporations should work with like-minded businesses, governments, the World Economic Forum and the Global Partnership for Education, “a multilateral public-private partnership focused on delivering a quality education to all girls and boys.” The report provides examples of how the U.N. has profitably worked alongside corporations such as Hess, Discovery Communication, Sumitomo Chemical and ING Bank. In the words of one functionary, the “U.N. considers working with the private sector as a necessity not an option.” The U.N. leadership does not seem concerned that the organization should have different priorities than multinational corporations or that the private sector may prefer to train workers rather than educate citizens to think for themselves.

McQueary wished for a storm to wipe away Chicago’s corruption, slash the city’s budget and introduce private education. However, she did not mention how African-Americans in New Orleans were disproportionately affected by the disaster or how race became a determining factor in what was rebuilt, how and where.

A decade on, much remains unfinished. New Orleans still has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, though a recent study by the Data Center found a 67 percent drop in the city’s prison population since Katrina. The private prison industry appears pleased with its successes, contracting many facilities with troubled records. At least a quarter of New Orleans’ population gets by at or below the national poverty line. Illiteracy is rife. But not everyone agrees: According to a new study by Louisiana State University, a majority of white residents in New Orleans said they believe that the city has mostly recovered, while black residents reported the opposite.

McQueary’s column received a deluge of criticism. “I wrote what I did not out of lack of empathy or racism but out of long-standing frustration with Chicago’s poorly managed finances,” she explained in a follow-up post the next day. But it was too late: No amount of call for “revolutionary change” in Chicago and an end to “borrowing our way into bankruptcy” would repair the damage.

None of this should have been surprising. McQueary was being honest about a phenomenon that Canadian writer Naomi Klein termed disaster capitalism, which profits from vulnerable people’s misery. McQueary was tone deaf to the human cost of her preferred policies. For example, she endorsed dismissing labor contracts and teacher unions, calling for “a free-market education” model and “a school system with the flexibility of an entrepreneur.”

In practice, this means deregulating and privatizing companies and services with lower pay for employees, fewer unions and inflexible working hours. The prevailing neoliberal economic order ensures that the profit motive is built into the delivery of services. This is why avoiding another Katrina requires examining what Klein refers to as “﻿the reality of an economic order built on white supremacy.”

Politicians and commentators the world over see disaster capitalism as rational and necessary after a natural or man-made crisis. This is good for you, we’re told; better housing, schooling and infrastructure will follow. In reality, however, the much-vaunted austerity — sold as an answer to economic woes in Greece, Puerto Rico and cities across the United States that lack a secure safety net for the poor — simply doesn’t work. But it lines the pockets of corporations that see the crisis as a financial opportunity."

Like Barack Obama in 2008, they aren’t longtime senators tainted by Washington, but they do know their way around government. Rubio continually demonstrates that all the hype about his talent is not entirely hype. He is expert at deflecting criticism, dispensing charm, telling his personal story and reassuring voters. On top of that, he is a bilingual Latino from the critical swing state of Florida. He’s also a policy thinker. God knows liberals won’t agree with his ideas, but he is definitely putting out ideas .

If Republican primary voters come to share Kasich’s concern but not his opinion that he or another veteran governor is the best choice, the candidates perfectly positioned to benefit are Rubio and Cruz.

One of them, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is hitting hard on his party’s infatuation with Trump and Carson and his concern, as he put it, that “we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.” His points — about fantasy budgets, scaring seniors, splitting up immigrant families — will resonate with many. But when he made them at the debate, he seemed hot and bothered and a bit angry.

The Republican field has been dominated by real estate magnate Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who have never held a political office or even run for one. Governors and former governors, who usually own the outsider brand in presidential races, are struggling.

All three are in their mid-40s — a generational handoff that is a striking contrast to Democrats, with their veteran band of congressional leaders and 2016 front-runners. What looks like disarray in the GOP to some analysts could just as easily be interpreted as transition. And as we’ve seen on Capitol Hill this week, the chaotic aspects of a transition can sometimes resolve in ways that produce the best outcome for Republicans and the riskiest for Democrats.

That’s the inescapable impression from the one-two punch of excellent showings by Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz in the CNBC presidential debate Wednesday night in Boulder, Colorado, and Rep. Paul Ryan’s election as speaker of the House the next day. Ryan is now second only to Vice President Joe Biden in the line of succession to the presidency, and Rubio and Cruz remain very much in the hunt for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

Rubio and Cruz are in the wings, available to satisfy the political cravings of grass-roots conservatives who disdain Washington but may have second thoughts about nominating a political neophyte.

Rubio has long been mentioned as a potential nominee. Cruz, by contrast, has just landed on my radar, because he seems to be changing in ways that might broaden his appeal. For instance, he criticized the controversial bipartisan budget and debt deal that passed the House on Wednesday, but unlike Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, another 2016 hopeful, he did not immediately vow to try to block it. That was different for Cruz, who has been a fan of filibusters, government shutdowns and other disruptive tactics. Maybe it’s a sign that he is moving on from his scorched-earth days. Or maybe he recognizes that both he and his party would be blamed for dysfunction and the GOP nominee — possibly him — punished at the polls next year.

Cruz displayed a newfound humor and self-awareness during the CNBC debate. “I’m too agreeable, easygoing,” the notorious firebrand joked when asked his greatest weakness and added more seriously, “If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.” When moderator Carl Quintanilla came back to him after a contentious exchange and said, “We’re clearly not having that beer you mentioned,” Cruz responded, “Then I’ll buy you a tequila or even some famous Colorado brownies.”

Fun guy. But here’s the worst part, from the Democratic standpoint: In a New Yorker article this month, Cruz sounded absolutely reasonable on foreign policy. He placed himself somewhere between Paul’s caution about military intervention and the hawkish end of the GOP spectrum, where Rubio resides with Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Cruz said his reference point was Ronald Reagan and his peace-through-strength approach. “Speaking for freedom is not the same thing as using U.S. military force,” he told the magazine. And “Reagan went through eight years in the presidency, and the biggest country he ever invaded was Grenada.”

This type of modulated moderation could play well in a general election, even as the Trump and Carson legions could gravitate to Cruz as the next best thing to a true outsider.

Where are the governors — practical, accomplished, knowledgeable — when you need them? This time around, nowhere. On the Democratic side, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is not scratching against Sen. Bernie Sanders or former Sen. and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee has bowed out. As for Republicans, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry have already quit, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former New York Gov. George Pataki have yet to ascend from the undercard debates to prime time.

Those who have made the main stage — Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas — are getting little traction and are less likely nominees at this point than Rubio or Cruz. That’s particularly true for Bush, whose candidacy many commentators declared all but dead after a decidedly subpar performance in the Colorado debate.

Why, you are probably wondering, do I give such short shrift to Carson and Trump? Because I still don’t believe they will go the distance, even in a Republican contest that so far doesn’t look much like anything we’ve seen before. Meanwhile, Rubio and Cruz are in the wings, available to satisfy the political cravings of grass-roots conservatives who disdain Washington but ultimately may have second thoughts about nominating someone who has never been part of a government, much less run a country."

GOP strategist Brad Todd told Politico that once the process of primary deliberation begins in earnest, the Trump campaign will take its rightful place in the dustbin of American political history. When people start “passing out actual ballots at elementary schools at a thousand Iowa caucus locations, making this less like ‘American Idol’ and more like a decision with consequences” Todd said, Trump will be toast.

But the widespread wish to dismiss Trump as a fly-by-night political celebrity gets no closer to the heart of his surprise one-man siege of the GOP’s top tier. The unlikely spectacle of a billionaire media exhibitionist spearheading a populist conservative revolt more likely stems from the most obvious and fundamental truth about this primary cycle: Donald Trump is a loud, brash, self-promoting rebuke to the great American myth of meritocratic achievement.

Think about it. It’s a long-standing political rite of passage for candidates to advertise their bona fides as self-made strivers. Even coddled princelings of the overclass, such as George W. Bush and his younger brother Jeb, had to peddle the laughable fable that they overcame personal adversity and assorted market challenges to hoist their already well-known names in the public firmament. More commonly, presidential hopefuls will play up the story of how they acquired their selfless devotion to public in the school of hard knocks.

Sometimes this saving wisdom arises from an inspirational, upward-tending personal biography (Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and countless others). For others, it’s simply a self-evident gospel truth — an unshakable faith in plucky American enterprise (Ronald Reagan, Mitt Romney and all the Republicans of the 1920s). And in the most meritocratic American tradition of all, the apprenticeship to political leadership comes by way of the great character-building trials of military service (John McCain, John Kerry, John Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower).

It’s no exaggeration to say that Donald Trump makes a mockery of all of these lovingly burnished campfire stories of the presidential stump. He was draft eligible during the Vietnam War, but collected four student deferments, and has given various unsubstantiated accounts of his post-collegiate deferment on medical grounds.

As for his tour in college — that great proving ground of impartially achieved meritocratic success — Trump has flat-out refused to release his transcripts from Fordham and the University of Pennsylvania. It turns out that he graduated from the Wharton School of Business, but not, as he formerly claimed, at the head of his class. And it appears that he came into his college credentials the old-fashioned way — by exploiting moneyed family connections. He got into the prestigious Wharton program largely on the strength of an admissions interview with a counselor who was a high-school friend of Trump’s older brother Freddy. This is a tale of meritocratic success in the same way that, say, Lance Armstrong’s performance-enhanced reign atop the Tour de France was a triumph of the human spirit.

Of course, Trump’s initial claim to fame — his vast real estate fortune — was never something he earned by the sweat of his earnest, striving American brow, either. He inherited the Trump family’s New York real estate empire from his developer father, Fred, and proceeded to leverage it into a still larger land fiefdom through a slew of corrupt sweetheart deals with local and state governments, eminent-domain boondoggles and business alliances with the East Coast mafia. Any one of these deals would have been a major scandal for a candidate like Romney, who ran largely on applying his alleged business savvy to the public sector. Yet Trump uses them all as de facto credentials: He knows how to game an already rotten system, so we may as well give him the presidency.

Trump doesn’t flinch before accusations about his mobbed-up business past because the image of squalid-yet-savvy corruption is the very essence of his brand. Ever since Spy magazine memorably dubbed him a “short-fingered vulgarian” in the eighties, Trump has played the part of an East Side Fauntleroy — or perhaps, Fauntleroy’s lecherous, logorrheaic uncle — with gusto. Crusading populist leaders on the left, such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, may deplore the way the American economic system is rigged in the plutocracy’s favor; Trump, for his part, cheerfully offers himself as Exhibit A in the same case."

Today, “[o]ne notes … a sense of American exceptionalism as a kind of datum, a way of empirically describing certain important facets of American political culture, and as the object of a kind of faith,” V. Bradley Lewis wrote in America, a Jesuit-run magazine, a few years ago.

The idea of American exceptionalism is not a new one — it’s often traced back to French sociologist Alexis de Tocqueville, who described America as exceptional (and not necessarily in a good way.) But Tocqueville’s oft-misinterpreted comment has been transmogrified into a self-affirmation that has practically become a tenet of faith in mainstream political circles. Here, the United States is a distinctly moral nation — a “shining city on a hill,” to borrow President Ronald Reagan’s turn of phrase — with gifts so indispensable and consequential they’re worthy of universal admiration. Proponents argue that this excellence has, in turn, granted the United States certain rights—not to mention duties—on the world stage.

Francis has fans across the political spectrum. Their goals, too, are diverse. But for those seeking to use Francis’s message to bolster their own political career, perhaps the most bitter pill to swallow is the pope’s outright denial of American exceptionalism, or the belief that the United States is a unique nation and that its history, political system, and moral values are unparalleled. Instead of bolstering this self-affirming agenda, Francis tried to push a broader, almost theological argument: that if America is exceptional, its status is based on works — its actions, both at home and abroad — not faith alone. His message was that a self-congratulatory portrait blended with positive thinking is no guarantee of righteousness.

“This land has been blessed with tremendous gifts and opportunities,” he said. “I pray that you may all be good and generous stewards of the human and material resources entrusted to you. May God bless you all. God bless America.”

Pope Francis closed his whirlwind visit to the United States with an impassioned speech at the Philadelphia International Airport during which he thanked U.S. leaders, church officials, volunteers, and above all, God, for helping him “witness the faith of God’s people.”

That’s not to say that Francis failed to recognize the country’s various achievements. Rather, as Francis stressed constantly throughout his visit, a country’s greatness isn’t inherent, but born from great actions. As he told Congress in his speech on September 24:

A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty as Lincoln did, when it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters as Martin Luther King sought to do, when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work, the fruit of a faith which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton.

Francis’s “Fantastic Four,” as John Allen Jr. called them at Crux, are not simply a way for the pontiff to better connect Catholic teaching to American history. They also allow for the pontiff to push an agenda that embraces the Catholic social teaching in full — one that focuses on peace, poverty, and dialogue, as opposed to the usual repertoire condemning abortion, same-sex marriage, and contraception. It also offers Francis a venue to further his message that he is, as he said several times over the trip, an American.

Despite these “Fantastic Four,” if the United States is seeking exceptionalism based on works, by Francis’s assessment it has a long way to go. In terms of climate change — one of Francis’s main talking points — the United States has the dubious distinction of being a “leader” in the area of carbon dioxide emissions. According to a report from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, the United States totaled 5.7 billion metric tons of CO2 emitted in 2012, second only to China. The average American emits 16.4 million metric tons of CO2 a year, placing the U.S. behind Australia.

Francis also highlighted a Vatican favorite: the arms trade. In some respects, he chose the right crowd. The U.S. is the leading exporter of major conventional weapons systems, with its largest clients being South Korea, the UAE, and Australia. When the definition of armaments is widened to include small arms and light weapons (e.g., guns, grenades, and mortars), the numbers are more staggering. In 2012, the United States transferred $66 billion in arms, accounting for over 75 percent of all global arms transfers for that year.

When it comes to capital punishment, the United States remains one of the few developed nations (along with Japan, Taiwan and Singapore) to carry on the practice. Furthermore, while Francis’s aggressive anti-death penalty campaign may be widely embraced by like-minded activists and politicians, it isn’t necessarily representative of Catholic doctrine at large. As a number of Catholic commentators noted in the wake of Francis’s initial push, the church has not pushed an all-out ban, but contends the practice should be “very rare, if not practically nonexistent."" Even Francis’s recent appeal to halt the execution of Kelly Gissendaner in Georgia cites his anti-death penalty advocacy as more of a personal mission, not a doctrinal one.

All these issues demonstrate a need for a country that has a sound understanding of its relation to the rest of the world. One of Francis’s central points in Laudato Si’ applies to U.S. politics at large: In his own words, proper governance is borne out of a “correct relationship with the created world.” Such a relationship wouldn’t be grounded in a “Promethean vision of mastery over the world” (including mastery over one’s people). Instead, it would take into account the interconnectedness that exists between the governed to those who govern, as well as the nation and the rest of the international community.

If the United States is exceptional — as U.S. politicians almost uniformly believe — it’s a conditional status. Whether that status is lost in the eyes of the Vatican may have little effect on public opinion remains an unknown. Still, it’s a worthy cause to uphold."

The comment has drawn sharp criticism from Latinos, Asians and immigrant rights advocates. Bush has fumbled his response to the controversy.

Beyond its dehumanizing consequences, the myth of the “anchor baby” perpetuates the mistaken notion that having a U.S. citizen child is an effective means for unauthorized parents to stay in the United States. The fact is, having children who are U.S. citizens is rarely a factor in immigration decisions and the U.S. routinely rips families apart.

Separating a family through deportation can inflict severe trauma on children. But during his first six years in office, President Barack Obama’s administration deported more than 2 million immigrants under a legal framework that makes little to no consideration for family ties.

Obama’s recent executive actions offer some hope of partial protection to millions of undocumented families currently in the United States. But for those who are already torn apart and who try to return to the United States “as an act of love for their families,” as Bush put it last year, there is no legal recourse.

A Human Rights Watch (HRW) analysis of apprehensions at the border from 2011 to 2012 found that U.S. immigration agents detained and summarily deported more than 100,000 parents of more than 200,000 U.S. citizen children in those two years alone. Fewer than 10 percent of the parents of U.S. citizen children apprehended by border agents were allowed a hearing before an immigration judge at which they could potentially make claims about their family ties.

While the coverage has highlighted the Chamber’s faculty for undermining tobacco control internationally, it has largely omitted the organization’s political interference in the United States on behalf of Big Tobacco.

One of the clearest ways the Chamber of Commerce has peddled the tobacco industry’s interests at home is through trade negotiations. The U.S. is on the verge of completing what would be the world’s largest trade and investment treaty, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Many critics have opposed this deal, among the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim countries, over concerns about its possible effects on public health, the environment and workers’ rights.

This month trade ministers from the participating countries are heading to Hawaii to negotiate the last politically contentious issues in the treaty text, including policies that concern tobacco control. Over the years-long process, the Chamber has sent representatives to most TPP negotiations, advocating for Big Tobacco’s interests while enabling the tobacco industry to remain largely silent on the TPP.

In 2012, in response to an outcry from the public health community, the U.S. trade representative at the time, Ron Kirk, proposed a safe harbor provision, which would have provided stronger legal defenses against industry litigation fighting tobacco controls (though it would not have completely prevented such litigation). Since then, the Chamber has opposed any language singling out tobacco control measures for protection in the TPP. It has used every policy avenue available, from sending threatening letters to Barack Obama’s administration to aggressively pushing for private meetings with Kirk. In 2013 the U.S. caved to the Chamber’s pressure and abandoned its safe harbor approach to tobacco control, proposing instead weakened language that paid only lip service to public health. In response, dozens of members of Congress expressed to Obama their concern over the United States’ weakened tobacco proposal. In 2014 the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter to the Obama administration calling for complete protection for tobacco-related public health measures in the TPP.

One of the key elements of the TPP — and the one most sought after by Big Tobacco — is an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism. ISDS allows corporations to sue governments in foreign trade courts over regulations the corporations deem harmful to future profits. These trade courts operate largely in secret, their decisions cannot be appealed, and their judges are often lawyers for giant multinational corporations."

The program, which is aimed at educating teachers and students to help identify early signs of radicalism, was supposed to go online Nov. 2. Activists briefed by the FBI say the program will institutionalize the discriminatory profiling of Muslim youths. “The FBI is developing a website designed to provide awareness about the dangers of violent extremist predators on the Internet, with input from students, educators and community leaders,” the agency said in a statement last week. The online portal reportedly uses games and tips to warn users of potential radicalization. Dubbed Don’t Be a Puppet, the new program is based on a simple assumption: If teachers and students could be watchful of Muslim students and their extremist propensities, with the FBI’s help, the puppets could be “freed.” The program reportedly leads viewers through a series of questions and tips to help them identify people “on the path to extremism.” With each correct answer, animated scissors cut the puppet’s strings. It is based entirely on the spying of enlisted patriots on unwitting puppets of violent extremism rather than the puppet’s disavowal of extremist propaganda. “Freedom” happens, therefore, when the potential terrorist is identified and reported to law enforcement. Don’t Be a Puppet will be an easy and visible way for the FBI to justify its $8.46 billion annual budget, whose centerpiece is countering threats from what FBI Director James Comey called “homegrown violent extremists.” Enlisting public school teachers and students to spy on would-be terrorists expands the post-9/11 us-versus-them rhetoric to a new generation of kids. “It seems like they’re asking teachers to be extensions of law enforcement and to police thought and students as well,” Hoda Hawa, the director of policy and advocacy for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told The Washington Post. The new program would extend to schools the sort of spying and reporting that has already been utilized by law enforcement agencies — including the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (a national network for sharing information that could help detect, prevent or deter a terrorist attack) and the Department of Homeland Security’s If You See Something, Say Something campaign.

Overpoliced schools

These biased counterterrorism proposals contradict the mission of public education. Public school should be a place where students of all backgrounds learn and thrive. In recent years, however, law enforcement has entrenched itself in public schools. Some 43 percent of U.S. public schools, including 64 percent of high schools, have uniformed police officers. In the 2011–12 academic year, school officials reported nearly a quarter of a million students to law enforcement, 92,000 students were arrested, and 3.45 million students were suspended. Many public schools impose severe punishment for even small or first infractions, regardless of the circumstances, leading to students being expelled for such things as taking scissors or nail clippers to school.

Far from ‘freeing’ Muslim students from falling prey to violent extremism, the FBI’s flawed counterradicalization program would condemn Muslim students to arrest and undue scrutiny.

Unsurprisingly, African-American students were suspended and expelled at a rate three times that of white students. They accounted for 16 percent of enrollment but more than a quarter of referrals to school law enforcement. Even at preschool age, they made up 18 percent of enrollment but over half of out-of-school suspensions. African-American girls had a higher suspension rate than any other ethnicity, at 12 percent. Students of color with disabilities fared even worse, with 1 in 4 boys and 1 in 5 girls receiving out-of-school suspensions. The Don’t Be a Puppet program ensures that brutality at overpoliced U.S. public schools — as illustrated by a recent video of a female African-American student flung across a classroom by a police officer — is also deployed against Muslim students. Its very existence represents another step in the transformation of U.S. public schools into a war zone where the majority labels racial and religious minorities as imbued with potential criminality. In a highly publicized case in September, 14-year-old Texas teen Ahmed Mohamed was arrested for making a clock for a class project. He and his family have since announced plans to move to Qatar. Their decision makes sense. President Barack Obama may have defended Mohamed on social media, but institutions such as the FBI remain committed to extending and institutionalizing the paranoia and suspicion that put him in handcuffs. The arrests, suspensions and expulsions of African-American students are justified by the logic that teaching them a lesson early will save the kids from a future of criminality. It disguises the racism of criminalizing young students as a sort of tough love that would benefit them in the future. The FBI’s new online tool appears to follow a similar logic. The agency wants schoolteachers and students to become the eyes and ears of the state in order to free Muslim students from becoming puppets of extremist groups. To accomplish this, it had rebranded the Islamophobe as the patriot. Not even a rebuke from the 9/11 Review Commission in March, which stated that the FBI was not the vehicle for producing prevention programs to counter violent extremism, has been able to halt this latest construction of the terrorism-industrial complex.

But the death toll from the heat wave continues to climb, and has now surpassed 1,200. The chief minister of the province, Syed Qaim Ali Shah, appeared in the provincial assembly after the worst was over. Along with other members of his Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Shah declared a protest sit-in against the federal government and K-Electric, the privately held company responsible for providing electricity to Karachi, thereby linking the deaths to K-Electric’s power outages.

Interruptions in the electricity provision and subsequent protests, especially during the summer when the demand for electricity far surpasses supply, are common in Pakistan. The problem with Shah’s decision to protest is that K-Electric’s power outages, while problematic, have little to do with the deaths, which resulted from a lack of awareness about heat stroke prevention techniques and an inability to rehydrate for those fasting during the month of Ramadan.

It is useful to compare Europe's catastrophic heat wave in 2003. Nearly 15,000 people died in France alone, despite the fact that there were no power outages there. After the disaster passed, France had a chance to identify the statistically significant risk factors of the heat wave’s victims: Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, manual workers, the elderly and homeless people were the most susceptible.

Hospital administrators and doctors in Karachi have loosely divided the victims into three similar groups: the elderly, daily-wage laborers and the homeless. It is evident that the latter two would not have been any better off had there been an uninterrupted electricity supply in Karachi. As for the first group, in France, people above the age of 65 years make up 17 percent of the population, compared to Pakistan’s meager 4 percent — a demographic makeup that may have largely curtailed the number of possible deaths.

Why, then, is K-Electric being blamed for the rising death toll? Because pointing fingers is easier than finding solutions. The evasion of responsibility began at the top: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif asked the National Disaster Management Authority to look into the matter, which passed on the job to the Karachi corps commander. (Pakistan’s army has always outperformed the civil government when it comes to managing emergencies.) While the military set up heat stroke centers across the province and equipped them with army doctors, the federal and provincial ministers led shouting matches in their respective assemblies. The leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, who also belongs to the PPP, lashed out against the federal government for the outages; opposition parties within the Sindh provincial assembly submitted a resolution condemning the provincial government and K-Electric for the deaths.

The minister of state for water and power then issued empty threats to take over K-Electric unless they improved their performance. And because no one likes being left out, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province threatened to burn down Pesco, the state-owned power supplier, unless power outages were curtailed."

This proves problematic on both an individual and an aggregate level. Writing in the New York Times, Harvard political theorist Yascha Mounk points out that Asian students must outperform their white peers by 140 SAT points to win admission to elite universities.

The positive stereotyping Kristof applauds can be especially alienating to members of these groups. Asian-Americans who don’t live up to academic expectations face greater social stigma and are less likely to get the help they need. The model minority myth fails to view Asian-Americans with this much-needed granularity, and prevents us from addressing the unique challenges facing the community today. After all, as Kristof himself notes, “because one group can access the American dream does not mean that all groups can.”

Kristof is correct that the average income and education level of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders is relatively high , but he doesn’t note, for instance, that the percentage of Asian-Americans living below poverty is slightly greater than the national average. Poverty and dropout rates among Southeast Asians are staggeringly elevated, with poverty rates among some ethnic Asian groups over three times the national average, and high-school dropout rates ranging from 35 to 40 percent for Cambodians, Laotians, and Hmongs. Asian America is thus no less monolithic than white America.

A recent New York Times column by Nicholas Kristof titled “The Asian Advantage” comes to similar conclusions: Asian-Americans are uniquely situated to succeed in America, but other groups face tougher odds. Kristof attributes the supposedly universal success of Asian-Americans to a variety of factors, such as a “Confucian emphasis on education” and a belief in the value of hard work. He further argues that “positive stereotyping” is a net good that helps Asian-American students succeed in the classroom in part because teachers expect them to excel at math.

In the debate, Cooper posited that Webb’s stance against affirmative action would alienate minority voters. “I have always supported affirmative action for African-Americans,” Webb clarified. But he went on to question the legitimacy of “diversity programs that include everyone, quote, of color,” accompanying the phrase with skeptical air quotes that minority voters surely found welcoming and inclusive.

“Those who came to this country in recent decades from Asia, Latin America, and Africa did not suffer discrimination from our government,” Webb notes in the article, adding that this makes them unworthy “beneficiaries of special government programs ... in a wide variety of areas including business startups, academic admissions, job promotions and lucrative government contracts.” Resting his case on the false premise that class and race-based affirmative action are mutually exclusive, Webb maintains that these programs harm impoverished whites. “Contrary to assumption in the law,” Webb writes, “white America is hardly a monolith.”

In the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13, Anderson Cooper questioned Jim Webb’s stance on affirmative action, citing a 2010 op-ed by the then-Senator that called the practice discriminatory and referred to white privilege as a myth.

Kristof does briefly pay lip service to concerns of discrimination against Asian-Americans, but then blithely dismisses them:

[Scholars] say Asian-Americans work hard to succeed in areas with clear metrics like math and science in part as a protection against bias — and in any case, many Asians still perceive a ‘bamboo ceiling’ that is hard to break through. To me, the success of Asian-Americans is a tribute to hard work, strong families and passion for education. Bravo!

Kristof may be celebrating, but these are not mere trifles. The so-called bamboo ceiling, which prevents Asian-Americans from rising through the ranks to the upper tiers of management, is not just a perception; it’s a well-documented social trend. Further, the fact that Asian-Americans are driven en masse towards industries most likely to mitigate the effects of prejudice hardly represents a progressive victory.

If anything, Asian-Americans often face a damned if they do, damned if they don’t scenario. Those who do indulge an interest, however genuine, in math or science are more likely to be typecast. “He’s quiet and, of course, wants to be a doctor,” wrote one Harvard admissions officer in evaluating an Asian applicant. Meanwhile, Asian-Americans’ entry to atypical fields is inhibited by bias. Kristof bolsters this view when he, without citation, claims that “Among Asians, there’s sometimes concern that there’s too much focus on memorization, not enough on creativity,” in a discussion of the downsides of positive stereotyping.

If there is actual evidence suggesting that quantitative and artistic ability are negatively correlated, or that race is a good proxy for the latter, he fails to present it.

Of course, Asian-Americans are not alone in facing discrimination. On Tuesday night, Webb took care to note that African-Americans have a “unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed,” and that this must be addressed with public policy.

Yet it’s possible to advocate for as much without using Asian-Americans as a foil. “As recognized by the Supreme Court, schools have an interest in recruiting … minority students to obtain ‘the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body,’” Mounk writes. “This justifies … admissions standards that look favorably on underrepresented groups. … But it can neither explain nor justify why a student of Chinese, Korean, or Indian descent is so much less likely to be admitted than a white one.”

Pointing to policies such as favored legacy admissions, which tend to disproportionately benefit whites, he gets to the crux of the issue. “The real problem is that, in a meritocratic system, whites would be a minority — and Harvard just isn’t comfortable with that.” Indeed, thorough analysis has demonstrated that race-based admissions practices at elite universities present virtually no opportunity cost to white applicants (and significant opportunity cost to Asians.) Webb may be appealing to white Americans who see their race as a disadvantage, but this false sense of victimhood is not in line with statistical realities.

Having to cater to external biases to flourish in one’s academic and professional life is by no means an advantage, nor is that discrimination felt less acutely merely because some level of success is achieved. Similarly, that some Asian-Americans demonstrate a willingness and ability to work hard enough to overcome prejudices does not make the weight of racism less of a burden, or transform it into a privilege. It is certainly no true realization of the American dream."

This case revealed to the world the agonizing difficulty of providing a level playing field to indigenous peoples, who are most vulnerable to climate change, and most vital in finding a way to slow it down. Yet the case hasn’t succeeded in stopping the violence that continues to endanger indigenous peoples.

On Thursday, Pope Francis will issue a highly anticipated encyclical on man, religion and the environment, a text that is expected to influence the outcome of the Paris climate talks in December. We know already what side he is on. During a January visit to typhoon-ravaged villages in the Philippines — my home country — he called on humanity to protect the earth, which he called “a beautiful garden for the human family.” And he captured headlines last year when he called the destruction of South America’s rain forests a “ sin. ” To the world’s 370 million indigenous people, many of whom live in overlooked and remote corners of the world, the pope’s words offer hope — regardless of whether they share his spiritual beliefs. As some of the first victims of climate change by virtue of their dependence on the world’s natural resources, these communities are finding themselves on the front lines of the environmental crisis. They are playing David against governments and developers eager to destroy their pristine forests, fields and streams to build mines, dams and agricultural plantations, all in the name of what the pope calls a “throw-away” economic system. Far too many indigenous activists have become martyrs of this movement. A recent Global Witness report estimated that last year alone, 116 environmental activists died while trying to protect their lands from developers, as well as illegal loggers, drug traffickers and others whose criminal activities destroy our forests. Among these mostly indigenous fighters were seven activists from Argentina, the pope’s homeland.

Though often framed by land developers and government officials in some countries as a selfish refusal to embrace modernity and a new way of life, this quest to save indigenous lands and forests is motivated by a profound spiritual belief in the need to protect Mother Earth. Whether the voices come from the indigenous communities of Paraguay’s threated Chaco forests or the First Nations of Canada, I hear the same message on every continent: Forest peoples seek to honor the spirits of our elders and ensure that future generations can preserve their traditions and lifestyle.



Their work benefits us all. Curbing the activities of large corporations that grab and destroy our lands means reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Preventing deforestation helps, too: Forests function like the planet’s lungs, filtering and cleaning the air. Studies have shown that the 513 million hectares of forests that indigenous communities protect store 37.7 billion tons of carbon, making indigenous peoples a potent and valuable weapon in global efforts to end climate change.



In recent speeches on the climate, the pope has stressed humanity’s duty “to till the earth and to keep it.” For centuries, indigenous peoples who sustainably manage their forests have embodied this harmonious relationship between people and their natural surroundings. Communities across the globe have successfully “kept” their forests while “tilling” them with the utmost care to secure sustainable income sources, from wild honey and wax to fruits and fish. They take just enough to live and thrive — nothing more.



The pope would certainly agree that indigenous people offer invaluable lessons to a world seeking a sustainable future that eschews what he calls the “plunder” of nature. It’s time for leaders, CEOs and investors who say they care about the environment to finally acknowledge that indigenous people are a major part of the solution to global warming. And governments, on their part, should grant indigenous people strong, unambiguous rights over the land where they live. Researchers have shown that deforestation rates are significantly lower in community-managed forests where rights are strong and reinforced by local and national authorities.

The international community should take notice, too: The upcoming climate talks in Paris will fall short of reaching a comprehensive solution if negotiators do not acknowledge this link between indigenous rights and the health of the world’s natural resources.



As a member of the Kankana-ey Igorot in the Philippines, I, like the pope, was deeply touched by the destruction left in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. My indigenous brothers and sisters lost their homes, boats and livelihoods, and are recovering from the trauma still. They live simple, sustainable lives, in harmony with the forests, oceans and mountains around them, yet end up bearing the worst effects of climate change. They are not alone. In the Andes of Peru, melting glaciers threaten the lives of the indigenous Quechua, and in the northern stretches of Scandinavia and Finland, Sami herders are seeing reindeer populations drop as the weather warms. And in the Amazon forests of Ecuador, Brazil and Bolivia, indigenous peoples are finding their rain forests are drying out.



We hope that having a visionary pope on our side will help the world to realize that it is best for indigenous people, the environment and the rest of humanity when we are free to focus on preserving our collective “beautiful garden” for future generations — instead of fighting for our lives."

Since Simba of “The Lion King” fame, no other lion has captured the world’s imagination in this way. The brutal killing of Cecil by Walter Palmer, an American dentist, has horrified and outraged people around the world. Palmer has been the subject of much criticism in the media. I understand why people are upset and angry over his vile act. I love animals. As a small boy herding cattle with my friends in a village in Zimbabwe, we fought boys from another community for killing defenseless little birds. I despise cruelty in general, particularly toward wild creatures. But it is important to put the outrage over Cecil’s death into perspective. We Zimbabweans don’t write our stories often enough. We leave them to be written by others and complain when our stories are not told properly and accurately. So let me tell my Zimbabwean version of the Cecil story.

A love of animals

Cecil’s tragedy has catapulted Zimbabwe in the news cycle; this time the villain is a dentist from Minnesota, not the usual characters from the political tribe. Reading about a “famous” and “much-loved” Zimbabwean lion in the international news, I was surprised that I did not know Cecil or that he was famous. I remembered Maswerasei, a lion that caused terror in Hurungwe, a rural area in the northwest of Zimbabwe, in the late 1980s. Myths were built around Maswerasei; legend has it that the notorious lion appeared only close to sunset, when people typically ask “Maswerasei” when they meet, meaning “How has your day been?” Cecil was new to me. So I did a quick poll in my friends and family in Zimbabwe and around the world. None of them knew Cecil, who was supposedly “a symbol of Zimbabwe,” as one British paper put it. The Zimbabwean reaction on social media was mixed and reflected conflicting sentiments. Many were outraged. Others were skeptical about the international media coverage of the story. Zimbabwe is going through serious economic challenges. Most people have pressing needs — food, shelter and employment. Thousands of workers have been laid off after a Supreme Court judgment earlier this month that allows companies to terminate workers without offering severance packages. Itai Dzamara, a Zimbabwean democracy activist, has been missing for more than four months. His family, friends and sympathizers are worried about his safety and whereabouts. Unlike Cecil’s story, Dzamara’s has not received much international coverage. So forgive us ordinary Zimbabweans if our attention appears not so focused on Cecil. To be sure, we care about animals. In fact, I don’t know if there is any other culture in which people identify with wild animals as much as Zimbabweans do. Our clan names include Shumba (lion), Hove (fish), Mhofu (eland), Soko/Mukanya (monkey/baboon) and other references to animals and birds of the wild. I come from the Hove totem. As a result, along with my clan folk, I do not eat fish. This is true for other totems. You don’t eat or kill the animal or bird with which you are associated because, in effect, you would be killing or eating your own flesh and blood. Our ancestors knew the value of animals. This was one system of preserving them. Our society restricted who ate what from the wild in order to avoid overexploitation. Shumba clan members are regarded as the guardians of the nation, in whom the mhondoro, the spirits of the land, reside.

Cecil may have been famous only among a small segment of our society, a privileged group that had a stake in the lucrative tourism sector and the hunting industry.

Simply put, the manner in which Cecil’s story has been presented by the mainstream media appears removed from the lived realities of most Zimbabweans. The reason lies in the skewed economics around the tourism and hunting industries in Zimbabwe. It is mired in elitism and beyond the reach of many ordinary citizens. Local tourism is very weak. The economy is stagnant, and only a privileged few have disposable income to afford tourist excursions. Apart from the few, Zimbabweans generally don’t go on vacation to a tourist facility such as a national park for wild animals. If they do, they are probably kids on an organized school trip or senior employees of someone who owns a chalet or a lodge at a tourist resort. Or they may go if nongovernmental groups organize a workshop at one of the wildlife resorts. Instead, our holidays typically consist of going to a rural village to spend time with the old folks and escape the routine of city life, if only for a few days.

A well-drilled army

Contrary to some perceptions, most people in Africa don’t live with or alongside wild animals. I once saw a crocodile while herding livestock, when it wrestled and killed a goat. I didn’t see lions, elephants and hippopotamuses until I was about 15, and I did only because our school took a field trip to Lake Kariba. Most Zimbabweans have actually never seen a lion, apart from pictures in books and Simba from “The Lion King.” For those who live near wildlife parks, there are really no good and bad lions as in that movie. Lions are big, violent and scary creatures that can devour them and their livestock. As such, Cecil may have been famous only among a small segment of our society, a privileged group that had a stake — either as vendors or consumers — in the lucrative tourism sector and the hunting industry. The hunting industry is one of the last big secrets in the Zimbabwean economy. And as the furor over Cecil story suggests, it is hideous and corrupt. It operates like a mafia. Wealthy, professional and licensed hunters are glorified poachers who move like a well-drilled army. And many unlicensed poachers operate like a ragtag army of bandits. But the result is the same: They both kill wild animals — hundreds, if not thousands, every day during the unofficial hunting season, from April to November. Palmer has been maligned for his vile passion for trophies that led to Cecil’s death. But he is hardly alone. There are many hunters like him out there. These are not your average Brit from a council flat in Peckham or Joe the plumber from a working-class American town. These are wealthy fellows, with million-dollar pads in Kensington or Manhattan. They enjoy blood sports. They love killing. And there is an industry that feeds their passion. When they meet at their gentlemen’s clubs, they probably show off their trophies — which is why they are happy enough to be photographed next to their big kills, grinning like idiots. In Zimbabwe, hunting is a regulated industry but faces very little scrutiny. There is also a racial and class element to all of this, which explains the fight between black politicians and white farmers over wildlife conservancies. These are places where wild animals can live protected from poaching but, unlike national parks, they are private property.

Until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter. Chinua Achebe Nigerian author, poet and critic

After Zimbabwe’s independence, when black politicians took over commercial farms, they realized that there was another, perhaps more lucrative sector that was still run exclusively by the whites. So the black politicians decided that they wanted a share of it. One big fight was over Save Conservancy, a large, rich outfit in Masvingo in southeastern Zimbabwe. It appears that the parties eventually reached a mutually beneficial settlement, and soon they were all “eating,” as sharing loot is called in the streets of Harare. The majority of Zimbabweans are oblivious of this economy around wildlife and have no stake in it. A professional hunter doesn’t simply go out and hunt. He has to get a license from the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA). The country is blessed with lots of wild animals, and while we preserve them, it is important to ensure there is a balance with communities near animal preserves. If animals threatened their livelihood, locals would get angry and kill them all. This is why the government conducts regular censuses and culls animals if they exceed carrying capacity. The hunting industry is justified in this context. The ZPWMA issues permits to professional local and international hunters. It identifies the game that may be hunted and sets quotas. The permits — or hunting concessions, as they are called — cost a lot. A foreign hunter is required to work with locals and pay fees, thousands of dollars a day to hunt and thousands more to take the trophy after the kill. The meat is shared or sold on the local market. The skins and other parts are sold mostly on the international market. From those who issue licenses to those who provide guidance and assistance to foreign hunters and transport and logistics providers, there are many rent-seeking opportunities in the industry. Two Zimbabweans — a landowner and professional hunter — arrested in the death of Cecil the lion were released on bail on Wednesday. Zimbabwe is also expected to seek Palmer's extradition from the United States. But it is unlikely that something will happen to them.

He is refusing to use his clear statutory authority to label the report a federal record, which would be subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) disclosure requirements, because the Justice Department has told the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) not to. The DOJ has a long history of breaking the law to avoid releasing information in response to FOIA requests. The NARA does not have such a legacy and should not allow itself to be bullied by the DOJ.

The DOJ instructed the NARA not to make any determination on the torture report’s status as a federal record, ostensibly because it would jeopardize the government’s position in a FOIA lawsuit seeking the report’s release. The DOJ, however, has no right to tell the NARA not to weigh in on the record’s status, and the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 gives the archivist of the United States the binding legal authority to make precisely that determination.

Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Dianne Feinstein of California revealed the DOJ’s insistence that the archivist of the United States not faithfully fulfill his duty in a Nov. 5, 2015, letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. They protested the DOJ’s refusal to allow its officials as well as those of the Defense Department, the CIA and the State Department to read the report. Leahy and Feinstein’s letter notes that “personnel at the National Archives and Records Administration have stated that, based on guidance from the Department of Justice, they will not respond to questions about whether the study constitutes a federal record under the Federal Records Act because the FOIA case is pending.” Rather than try to win the FOIA case on a technicality and step on the NARA’s statutory toes, the DOJ should allow the FOIA review process to determine on the case’s merits whether the document may be released.

Not even officials with security clearances may read the document while its status as a congressional or federal record is debated. The New York Times reported in November 2015 that in December of the previous year, a Senate staffer delivered envelopes containing the 6,700-page top secret report to the DOJ, the State Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pentagon. Yet a year later, none of the envelopes had been opened, and none of the country’s top officials had read the report’s complete findings. This is because the DOJ, the Times wrote, “prohibited officials from the government agencies that possess it from even opening the report, effectively keeping the people in charge of America’s counterterrorism future from reading about its past.” The DOJ contends that if any agency officials read the report, it could alter the outcome of the FOIA lawsuit."

For several weeks, politicians from the right and center-right opposition parties threatened to move in Congress against Rousseff, who leads the left-wing Workers’ Party.

Since the beginning of her second term, the beleaguered Rousseff has been dealing with a wide-ranging corruption investigation that has uncovered evidence of massive graft across the private and public sectors. Emboldened by conservative mobilizations in the streets, the media have been marching to the drumbeat of impeachment for months, and the currency is in free fall.

The only person who may initiate the impeachment process, though, is the speaker of the house, Eduardo Cunha of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), nominally an ally of the ruling coalition. He too has been dogged by ethics charges, owing to recently surfaced evidence of graft and secret Swiss bank accounts in his name worth millions of dollars. The ethics committee he faced was made up of legislators from various parties, including the PMDB and the Workers’ Party.

Within hours of Workers’ Party representatives announcing they would vote against him in the ethics committee, Cunha formally initiated impeachment proceedings, in an apparent act of retaliation, exacerbating Brazil’s ongoing political turmoil. Vice President Michael Temer, also of the PMDB, has been silent in recent days. Some observers have interpreted this as a signal that he might support the impeachment as a way to ascend politically.

For impeachment to succeed, it must first survive legal challenges mounted by government lawyers, then clear a congressional committee and Congress before moving to a Senate vote, where the impeachment would take place. Although the corruption scandal has ensnared members of all major parties, Rousseff’s name has not appeared in any of those allegations. The legal claim for the impeachment is a technicality concerning the national budget: releasing funds from one year’s budget to the next, a questionable but widely practiced fiscal maneuver in Brazil at all levels of government.

Legal opinions aside, whether impeachment happens will have less to do with technicalities than with political alliances and mobilization in the next weeks. At the moment, the numbers appear favorable for Rousseff, with enough legislators opposing the process in both houses of Congress to defeat it. A number of important figures from other political parties have come out against impeachment, as have major civil society organizations, including the National Association of Lawyers and the National Conference of Bishops. They are united in defense of democracy and its institutions rather than in support of the Workers’ Party or Rousseff.

But it is still early, and the government has an interest in holding votes on impeachment as soon as possible. Members of the congressional coalition could desert the president and shift the balance against her, and analysts predict that social mobilizations against her could start up again, especially after Carnival in February."

In the encyclical’s first chapter, the pope’s greatly anticipated letter recognizes the “tragic rise” of immigrants fleeing poverty from environmental ruin in an age of climate change.

Declaring that refugees who have yet to be recognized by international governing bodies “bear the loss” of abandonment, the pope calls out the “widespread indifference” to “these tragedies” taking place around the world. Importantly, the letter cites the environmental effects of the “enormous consumption of some rich countries” and its repercussions on the farming practices in the poorest places on earth, notably in Africa.

By connecting the migrant crisis to the issue of global warming, the pope makes clear the need for collective responsibility on these conjoined fronts. The key line in his encyclical embraces a long-time demand of the global south: for the global north to recognize its “ecological debt.”

An estimated 1,800 migrants from the Middle East and North Africa have died in the last six months while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, according to international observers. Those who have reached Italian shores now surpass 50,000. According to a report released today by the United Nation refugee agency, a staggering 59.4 million people have been displaced from their homes in the last year, marking the worst migration crisis since World War II. The report calls it a “paradigm change.”

Francis’ message, released amid a growing international feud over the fate of unceasing waves of migrants and refugees making the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, provides a broader context for an international crisis that few have yet to link with climate change. In sum, global warring can no longer be separated from global warming.

Less than two months after an estimated 800 refugees drowned in the latest capsizing of smuggling boats from the ports of Libya, a political split between European nations over a shared immigration and refugee policy has overshadowed the climate origins of much of the crisis."

Smiling passengers eat luxury foods, beautiful stewardesses play with toddlers and giggling children watch personal televisions. Come to the United Arab Emirates, it suggests, and let your worries disappear.

For professor Andrew Ross of New York University, his worries began at the terminal. Waiting at JFK Airport to fly to NYU’s Abu Dhabi campus, he received word that he had been barred from entering the country because of “security concerns.”

Such “security concerns,” apparently a euphemism for Ross’s unkind remarks regarding the UAE’s exploitation of migrant construction workers, have increasingly defined the UAE’s relationship with its critics in recent years. Despite its attempts at disseminating a liberal and progressive image, the UAE has stepped up efforts to silence all dissent and criticism of the government, often justifying its oppressive measures as necessary to promote security and combat terrorism.

The UAE has touted its international activities in the fight against terrorism. Ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba has become something of a favorite in national security circles in Washington, where he has participated in Pentagon strategy meetings at the invitation of the Defense Policy Board, a committee that advises the secretary of defense on major defense policy issues. Speaking about U.S.-UAE cooperation on the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Otaiba told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, “You can’t do this without us, and we can’t do this without you.” During President Barack Obama’s remarks at the Countering Violent Extremism Summit in February 2015, he announced that the United States would be working with the UAE to create a digital communications hub to counter terrorist propaganda. The UAE Embassy publicized the launch of the Sawab Center in July, and in President Obama’s remarks at the U.N. General Assembly last month on countering violent extremism, he recognized the center for “exposing ISIL for what it is.”

Much less attention has been paid to the UAE’s passage of several laws that ostensibly aim to counter domestic extremism. Rather than clamping down on extremists, the government has largely used these laws to detain its critics with impunity.

The UAE’s 2014 law on combating terrorism prescribes lengthy prison terms for broadly defined terrorist acts. The law defines a “terrorist result” as inciting fear among a group of people or “opposing the country” without requiring intent to cause death or injury. It likewise prescribes the death penalty or life in prison for anyone who commits an action that prejudices national unity. UAE authorities sentenced Osama al-Najjer, the son of a UAE political prisoner, to three years in prison under the anti-terrorism law after he called for an investigation into credible allegations of torture at facilities where his father was being held."

But in its short tenure, the outlet has left an indelible mark on the American media landscape. Its editors eschewed click-bait, instead speaking truth to power and amplifying the struggles of marginalized people, both at home and abroad. Its broad purview was guided by the principle that distant tragedies are not as far away as they may seem, and that journalism plays a critical role in bridging artificial divides, fostering transnational solidarity and inspiring collective responsibility to confront the structural injustice that underlies much of human suffering.

Human rights discourse has not yet gained much traction in the United States. But AJAM, as the soon-to-be-defunct network is known, provided haunting and visceral details of human rights crises that are on the media radar such as the catastrophe facing Syrian refugees, but also the plight of those in more remote places — from Central African Republic to Burundi and Myanmar to Honduras — framing their stories within the globalized context in which they arise. It also covered crises at home, including the lead-poisoned water crisis in Flint, Michigan, through a human rights lens.

In journalism they say context is king. But contextualizing international stories remains an underappreciated virtue in the mainstream media. Human rights stories in faraway lands or besieged but disempowered local communities don’t lend themselves to light reading or generate the volume of web traffic that often drives coverage, nor can they rely on the comfort of shared experiences to foster empathy.

For Americans struggling under the weight of their own immediate needs and sidelined by sociopolitical exclusion, it’s hard to stay engaged in issues that don’t appear to have direct relevance to their everyday lives. It takes time and patience to sift through the polarized, nativist rhetoric and fear-mongering that saturates mainstream coverage and reinforces the narrow range of media’s echo chamber. The lack of context then leads to indifference toward those fleeing violent internecine conflicts or displaced by transnational extractive industries. But as civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. said, “True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar. It is to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.”

Toward that end, AJAM set itself apart by equalizing the traditionally differential access to the media. Opinion pages of the mainstream media tend to feature established columnists, but AJAM was willing to publish people whose narratives are typically only filtered through the platform of prominent writers. Young freelancers and local human rights advocates have moving and remarkable stories to tell, but they often lack experience writing for a global audience and more importantly connection to editors willing to democratize civil discourse.

AJAM editors welcomed and nurtured the voices of people from a diverse geographic, gender, religious and racial range, who helped unpack deeply held but poorly examined convictions, and cultivate empathy and global understanding.

Despite the chasm that appears to separate them, injustices are deeply intertwined, transcend borders and demand a collective response. AJAM presented a transnational and historical perspective that elevated concerns that may appear local but exist within globalization, whose structural underpinnings must be understood before they can be confronted and dismantled.

Human rights discourse in the U.S. tends to evoke the image of authoritarian leaders on distant soils. This is partly attributable to American exceptionalism — the idea that the U.S., which pushed for universal human rights standards after World War II, is beacon of global leadership, freedom and integrity and thus exempt from the rigors of self-critique or accountability for the rights principles to which other governments should be held.

But Washington’s uncritical self-congratulations don’t hold up. For one, its selective condemnation of leaders whose policies conflict with American interests while ignoring the transgressions of those who are more closely aligned only serves to erode Washington’s credibility."

The revelations came only days after Nigeria’s new President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in, after his election in March.

The report recounts the military’s abuses in Nigeria’s conflict-affected northeast. It documents the arbitrary arrests of 20,000 Nigerians, the extrajudicial killings of an estimated 1,200 civilians and the deaths of at least 7,000 Nigerians held in military detention centers.

The Nigerian military’s abuse of power and lack of accountability is not new. Over the years, it has shown a stunning lack of professionalism, has engaged in gross human rights violations and suffers from high rates of soldiers being absent without leave on the front lines of the fight against the Boko Haram insurgency. In fact, its grave improprieties have fueled the conflict, which has claimed nearly 19,000 lives and displaced an estimated 3 million to 4 million people since 2002.

Buhari has proposed to relocate the military headquarters to Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state and the center of the Boko Haram crisis. Reining in corruption and the military’s abuse of power is key to effectively countering the insurgency. Amnesty’s report offers Buhari a unique opportunity to do just that. He can send a clear message to the military brass by removing the officers implicated in the report from their positions and launching an investigation into the alleged abuses.

Throwing more money and soldiers at the insecurity in the northeast has proved ineffective. The security sector needs a radical overhaul, with an emphasis on improving the professionalism of its forces and accountability for human rights violations. Buhari’s reputation as a former military leader who took on corruption and indiscipline suggests that he could radically reform the military to prevent more abuses. But he can’t do it alone. The precarious state of the Nigerian economy makes international support critical to facilitating that effort. While Nigeria’s allies may now recoil from military partnership, the latest revelations underline the importance of international cooperation to promote professionalism and restore trust to Nigeria’s security sector. Rescinding military assistance to Nigeria would only increase the likelihood of more human rights abuses, further galvanizing Boko Haram and destabilizing the country.

Ending the alleged embezzling of funds intended to finance the campaign against Boko Haram should also be part of Buhari’s anti-corruption campaign. Prosecuting those who diverted funds from the military to their own pockets would demonstrate that no institution is above the rule of law. A 2012 survey by Afrobarometer, an African independent research group, found that 53 percent of Nigerians don’t trust the police. The lack of public trust in the security sector represents a significant threat to Africa’s most populous nation.

Boko Haram has capitalized on this mistrust and the erosion of legitimacy in the security sector. During the Giwa prison break in March 2014, the insurgents reportedly gave detainees the option of returning home or joining Boko Haram’s ranks once they were freed. The incident was featured in a propaganda video from the group that portrayed the rebels as the defenders of innocents persecuted by the state. Amnesty found that more than 600 of the detainees released during that raid were recaptured and extrajudicially killed by the military."

But this week, it entered a new phase.

Prior to the July 5 referendum, European officials had been carrying out a strategy of “regime change.” Deadlines came and went, and threats of a forced Grexit were mainly bluff, despite the fact that the most powerful leader of the eurogroup of finance ministers, Germany’s Wolfgang Schäuble, seemed to favor it. Under these circumstances, regime change looked relatively easy: The European Central Bank (ECB), by restricting credit, together with the standoff and rumors of Grexit, had already pushed the Greek economy back into recession. It seemed only a matter of time before Greece’s ongoing economic failure, combined with anti-Syriza media coverage, would undermine the current government and pave the way for a new one.

In his first interview since his July 6 resignation from the post of Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis describes “The complete lack of any democratic scruples, on behalf of the supposed defenders of Europe’s democracy,” i.e. his eurozone negotiating partners. They continuously “delayed and then came up with the kind of proposal you present to another side when you don’t want an agreement.”

On June 26, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called their bluff by announcing the referendum, which on July 5 produced a landslide “no” vote against further austerity and regressive “reforms.” This made regime change a somewhat more cumbersome strategy: If you are going to force out a government by wrecking the economy, the people have to blame the government rather than the foreign officials who are doing the wrecking. But the vote showed that Greeks saw who was responsible for their misery, especially after the ECB, in an effort to intimidate voters, forced a closure of the banking system — something it had not done in the past six years of crisis and depression.

This strengthened the position within the European camp of Schäuble and his allies who favored an “out now” solution, and Tsipras was faced with a choice, it appears, to accept the European authorities’ terms, or be forced out of the euro as the ECB continued to pummel the Greek banks and financial system. It was a hostage situation, and he chose to surrender, defending his decision on the grounds that although the voters had clearly rejected austerity, they also did not want to leave the euro.

However, the current deal, if it holds, almost certainly will not allow for the Greek economy to recover. The primary budget surplus targets of 2, 3, and 3.5 percent of GDP for the three years of the deal, 2016 through 2018, will make sure of that, given that country is running a primary budget deficit right now. The government is obviously unlikely to be able to meet these targets as the economy and therefore government revenues shrink. The Financial Times estimates that primary surpluses will contribute just 4.5 billion euros over the three years. Even if this estimate turns out to be low, this is a small part of a package currently estimated at 86 billion euros.

The fact that European officials are willing to keep the Greek economy indefinitely stuck in a depression for such a small fraction of the money that they are putting up –pocket change, really, relative to their resources – should be an eye-opener for anyone who is following the drama. It means that the European authorities are really not interested in an economic recovery in Greece in the near future, in part because if they were to allow a rapid recovery, then Syriza would be seen as successful, and encourage people to vote for left parties elsewhere. It also indicates that this fight is not mostly about the debt itself, but part of a much larger political struggle over what kind of society Greeks (and tens of millions of other Europeans) will live in.

The European authorities have now made it clear that, so long as they are in control of Greece’s economic policy, the country’s depression and mass unemployment will continue indefinitely. Even further debt relief, which is not yet part of the deal, will not improve the situation over the next three years, since it is very unlikely to reduce interest payments during this period."

I discovered these words a few years after Kuti’s untimely death in 1997. I was traveling in the Middle East, exploring how young musicians and fans of ostensibly Western forms of popular music such as heavy metal and hip-hop were challenging their countries’ conservative and authoritarian political cultures. These bursts of creativity eventually produced the soundtracks of the revolutionary upheavals that shook the region from Morocco to Iran in the past few years. Throughout the Islamic world, music was indeed a weapon — harsh, loud and condemnatory of the corruption, violence and lack of voice for the rapidly expanding youth population of the Middle East and North Africa. Young artists were on the front lines of protests, and because of that, many wound up jailed, tortured, exiled or killed. Yet even as the Arab Spring was sapped of energy by brutal governments and counterrevolutionary forces, artists have kept fighting, whether at home or increasingly in exile, to produce music that inspires their peers to continue the struggle. But what happens when the struggle becomes ineffectual and even pointless? What happens when there’s no room for politics, either because the corrupt system is too stable to change or because violence and war have made protest impossible? Sometimes, when change at the political level seems hopeless, the most beautiful and powerful music can emerge, providing a seed from which transformative visions for creating radically new ways of seeing and living in the world can grow.

Reuniting a region with music

Consider Pakistan: Despite its return to democracy in 2008, it remains one of the world’s most politically dysfunctional countries. But beyond politics lies a culture whose richness and complexity are especially apparent in music, in particular the country’s rock and fusion scenes. During the last 20 years, bands such as Junoon, Mizraab, Aaroh, Arieb Azhar and Sajid and Zeeshan produced fluid, high-energy hybrids of rock and South Asian pop, metal, electronic dance music and Qawwali styles. Although rarely heard outside the country, these groups pushed the boundaries of rock further than most anywhere else on earth. Even in this company, American-trained guitarist Mekaal Hasan has long stood out as an innovator, melding jazz, traditional South Asian music and metal into some of the most powerful world music produced in a generation. When I first met Hasan in his Lahore studio in 2007, his band was working through live arrangements of its 2004 debut record, “Sampooran,” and the musicality and power were head spinning. But it was with the departure of virtuoso singer Javed Bashir in 2012 that the music took on even more dimensions, as Hasan took the unprecedented step of bringing Indian and Bangladeshi musicians into a Pakistani band. Reuniting the subcontinent in one group was both a musical and an implicitly political act. “Today we have a Bengali Hindu, Sharmistha Chatterjee, singing Sufi/Qawwali lyrics. My rhythm section happens to be two Indian Catholic jazz musicians from Bombay, and the inestimable Muhammad Ahsan Papu remains on flute,” Hasan says. “Such a lineup forces people to see — hear — what unites rather than just divides us.” For Hasan, music can’t be just or primarily a weapon. “On the one hand, Fela understood what we now realize — musicians can’t wait, we have to take the lead. But Fela was working in a different situation. He didn’t have to deal with suicide bombers and the kind of difficult relationship that India and Pakistan have. We need to focus on collaboration more than competition, a message we take on the road from Bombay to Boston.”

From Long Beach to Kabul

Halfway around the world, in Long Beach, California, guitarist Lanny Cordola couldn’t agree more with Hasan’s sentiment. An original Lord of the Sunset Strip, Cordola spent the first 20 years of his career working with the likes of House of Lords, Gene Simmons, Guns N’ Roses and Cypress Hill, his tastes moving farther to the East as his career developed. While it’s certainly not uncommon for Western artists to become entranced with foreign styles, few are brave enough to travel through the badlands of Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province and into Afghanistan with nothing but a guitar, a smile and an endless faith in the power of music to heal people.

Even the most tragic and desperate situations contain seeds of change. Music is still a weapon in the struggles for freedom.

For the past five years, however, Cordola has been traveling across both countries, bringing together Pakistani pop stars such as Atif Aslam with Guns N’ Roses while taking music and aid to children in both countries, beginning with his first visit toCharsadda and the Swat district in Pakistan in 2010. As he traveled through areas that are supposedly hotbeds of anti-Western sentiments, he noticed that people loved to hear him playing guitar and that girls in particular were desperate for the chance to play music. During his first visit to Kabul, Afghanistan, he met the family of Khorshid and Parwana Hawa, two poor Afghan girls who, thanks to the project Skateistan, became fixtures on the burgeoning skateboard scene before being killed in a suicide bombing in 2012. He was so moved that he created a project, Miraculous Love Kids, to raise money for the girls’ family and their community. His peace jams have brought the plight of Afghanistan to fans of the many well-known artists who have joined the concerts and the larger project. Cordola’s newest and most powerful initiative, Girl with a Guitar, is taking guitars to Afghanistan and putting them in the hands of children, in particular girls but also boys, who have been deprived of so much. “It’s always about the kids,” he says. “When you go to places like Charsadda or Kabul and you see the smiles amidst all their pain, the music just flows. And it’s not really rock, even if we’re using the quintessential rock ’n’ roll instrument, the guitar. Playing in Afghanistan is like playing in a whole new tuning. It becomes much easier to expand your musical and cultural horizons, to become open to other cultures.

But the current hostilities with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other Islamic extremist groups don’t conform to any familiar patterns. This is a very 21st century war, with weapons, tactics and battlefields shifting with dizzying speed.

Consider the Chechen rebels, who first fought for independence from Russia, then switched their goal to establishing an emirate covering the Caucasus before finally swearing allegiance to ISIL, which is a part of the viral mutation of Islamic extremism — to the point that Al-Qaeda now seems like the sort of terrorist group that Western countries can do business with, like the Irish Republican Army or the Palestine Liberation Organization before it.

Targets are no longer just iconic places such as the World Trade Center and Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the site of a car bomb attack in October 2013 for which the East Turkestan Islamic Movement took responsibility. ISIL and those it inspires prefer soft targets, like a bar in Paris’ 11th Arrondissement and a community center in San Bernardino, California. The message is clear: No one is safe anywhere.

ISIL’s recruitment procedures have shifted. It now not only wants recruits to fight in Syria and Iraq but also seeks to inspire sympathizers to kill and create mayhem in their own countries. Westerners are worried that terrorists are among the Syrian refugees. ISIL has an analogous worry: that there will be spies among those volunteering to fight for the caliphate. ISIL recently executed a Russian it said was spying for Moscow.

ISIL has gone viral in more ways than one. The group moves and changes at the speed of the Internet. A group with a 7th century ideology and mentality has proved more talented at adapting social media to its ends than the secular Western governments under which the technology was developed.

At the same time, ISIL is the last gasp of the old dispensation — God-dominated and patriarchal, standing against gender equality and religious freedom. ISIL has holy days, not holidays. There is a deep, unhealthy puritanical streak running through ISIL. In a statement released after the Paris attacks, ISIL called the French capital “the capital of prostitution and vice.” ISIL views the very concept of vacations and leisure as essentially sinful, because they deny God by disregarding him.

ISIL can strike its enemies anywhere in the world. The Russian jet downed by an ISIL bomb in October was taking vacationers home from the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh. In November, Russia’s intelligence agency, the FSB, informed Thai authorities that terrorists were leaving Syria for Thailand with the aim of targeting resorts in Phuket and Pattaya, where 2 million Russians vacation annually."

It's called the VBLAST and it's a virtual surgery simulator, developed by Rensselear Polytechnic Institute's Suvranu De. The simulator uses touch feedback to help doctors develop the fine motor skills needed for laproscopic surgery, a common weight loss procedure. De says the hi-tech training tool provides an experience that is as authentic as practicing in the operating room, but eliminates potential harm to patients. (SOUNDBITE) (English) SUVRANU DE, PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF CENTER FOR MODELLING, SIMULATION AND IMAGING AT RENSSELEAR POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, SAYING: ""These are all done now by trial and error on models or on animals and humans, using patients as guinea pigs. The number of people the surgeon takes to learn a certain surgery is of the order of anywhere between 50-100. That many patients are typically at risk when a surgical procedure is learned in the operating room."" The virtual surgery simulator uses touch feedback, which realistically replicates the sensations a surgeon would feel when performing the procedure. In its early stages, the device used two forceps to pick up blocks that had the same resistance that organs and tissue would have. In its latest form however, students look at lifelike graphic versions of the esophagus, stomach and spleen, and highly sophisticated algorhythms create sounds and visuals that alert doctors when making mistakes. The RPI team have been collaborating on the simulator with a team of doctors and surgical residents at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Neil Kantack, a first year surgical resident, has tested both generations of the simulator. (SOUNDBITE) (English) DR. NEIL KANTACK, FIRST YEAR SURGICAL RESIDENT AT BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER SAYING: ""You have real life feedback when you grasp a block you can feel the amount of resistance in your hands change. Your can understand it -- your hands feel it your brain can sense it. In the new version there are no actual blocks. Instead there is a screen with virtual blocks and the device uses feedback technology to simulate that resistance so that you feel like you are actually performing the physical activity on an object that doesn't really exist."" Ultimately researchers say the V-Blast will give patients more confidence in their doctors before going under the knife because they are able to use the simulator to recognize deficiencies and get extra practice. Dr. Steven Schwaitzberg, president of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) says virtual technologies like the V-Blast are revolutionizing training for surgical students. (SOUNDBITE) (English) DR. STEVEN SCHWAITZBERG, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SURGERY AT BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER AND PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN GASTROINTESTINAL AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGEONS SAYING: ""I believe that we will figure out a way to model a body in the virtual world and then we will be able to do ... just like the pilots, the first 10-25% of your training all virtually so that you walk into your early operations with a degree of competency that hasn't been seen before in the history of surgery."" With technologies like the V-Blast, practice really can make perfect. Sharon Reich, Reuters"

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Italy is reeling from a 6.2-magnitude earthquake that hit just before dawn this morning. At least 38 people are reported killed. More are still missing. The most devastated towns are in the central part of the country, about an hour's drive from Rome. And we have a reporter covering the story there. It's Chris Livesay. He's on the line with us. And, Chris, I understand you're in Amatrice, which is right at the epicenter of this earthquake. And the mayor has told the Associated Press that the town is half gone. What are you seeing there?

CHRIS LIVESAY, BYLINE: Well, I'm seeing the same thing. It looks like it was the victim of a barrel bombing. It doesn't look like the quaint central Italian town people expect when they come up here. It does look like a war zone.

GREENE: And are people still being rescued? I mean, is there hope that there are people alive in some of the rubble there that they'll be able to find?

LIVESAY: Absolutely. I mean, emergency workers are moving as we speak to rescue people from underneath the rubble. There are still people that they know are alive. They can hear people screaming for help. It's basically been a steady flow of ambulances in and out of the most-affected areas and then the ambulances taking those people out to nearby pastures, where sheep are normally grazing. They had to chase away sheep, kick down picket fences and create impromptu helicopter landing pads in order to fly these people to hospitals in places like Rome.

GREENE: God, it just sounds terrible. I mean, are emergency personnel are able to keep up and actually get the injured out?

LIVESAY: They seem to be doing a pretty good job, considering all of the challenges. The biggest challenge apart from the earthquake and the rubble is actually the position of this town itself. It's inside Apennine Mountains, and the only way to get here is by going up these windy, narrow roads. And so you can imagine how difficult that becomes for emergency ambulances to get in. In fact, you've got people from the Red Cross. You've got local ambulances, fire departments, and they're having to navigate these streets and figure out who has priority in order to get the victims out. But other than that, it seems like they're pretty well-staffed and handling this emergency the best they can.

GREENE: How are people in this community dealing with this? And I imagine some of them are waiting to see if their loved ones will be found.

LIVESAY: Right. Well, I spoke to one family, for instance, that had traveled here from Rome. They were in Rome at the beach when they heard that their town had been struck by an earthquake. Fortunately, they were able to get in touch with their grandmother and other relatives who were here at the time, so they were relieved. But for other people, of course, it's not been a happy ending. We're still waiting to see what the death toll is here. But this town we know is - seems to, at least, have suffered the brunt of this very powerful earthquake, so it's going to take longer to figure out exactly how many people have been hurt and how many people have been killed.

GREENE: OK, well, we'll be coming back to you, I'm sure, throughout the day. That's Chris Livesay, who is covering the aftermath of this earthquake in Italy for NPR. Chris, thank you.

LIVESAY: Thank you.

It's important to say right upfront that this isn't a story about pedophile priests.

Bridie Farrell is Roman Catholic, but she says it was her speedskating coach who sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.

""It happened at his house, in his car, in his hotel room,"" Farrell says.

Farrell did what a lot of kids do when they're molested: She kept silent. But 18 years later, when she was 31 years old, she went public with her story.

The problem is that there's a ticking clock. In a lot of states, including New York, where Farrell was assaulted, if you don't report a rape or file a civil lawsuit fast enough, the perpetrator — whether it's a coach or relative or a priest — gets off scot-free.

But there is a growing effort in statehouses across the country to make it easier to prosecute or sue people who sexually abuse children. Victims rights groups hope some old cases can be reopened, but they face opposition from Roman Catholic leaders, who say the changes could target them unfairly and could bankrupt church organizations.

""It's broken""

New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat, pushed to extend the deadline for reporting sexual assaults against kids. He also wanted to open a one-year window, a kind of grace period, so that victims who have waited too long can get a second chance to sue in civil court.

""The statute of limitations for child sexual abuse is just too short,"" Hoylman says. ""In a word, it's broken.""

For Sexual Assault Victims, An Effort To Loosen Statutes Of Limitations Listen · 4:27 4:27

New York's Catholic bishops spent more than $2 million lobbying to block Hoylman's effort.

Dennis Poust, spokesman for the New York Catholic Conference, says it's fine to extend the statute of limitations for future sex crimes. But he doesn't think old cases — some of them decades old — should be dragged back into court.

""We just think it's fundamentally unjust,"" Poust says. ""Evidence is lost and memories fade; witnesses are dead. There's just no way to defend against such cases.""

Laws making it easier to prosecute pedophiles and opening retroactive windows for civil lawsuits have passed in other states, including California, Hawaii and Minnesota. Poust says in those places, Catholic organizations faced hundreds of millions of dollars in new claims and settlements.

""Plaintiff's attorneys have been teeing these cases up for many years and are more than willing to harm today's Catholics, who had nothing to do with abuse of the past,"" Poust says.

Other lobbying efforts

New York isn't the only state where Catholic leaders are pushing back.

In Pennsylvania, a similar measure was debated this spring. The Archdiocese of Philadelphia distributed fliers during Mass targeting Catholic lawmakers who support extending the statute of limitations. Pennsylvania state Rep. Nick Miccarelli, a Republican, says the church tried to shame him.

""This came from the archdiocese and the priests were kind of sent out to do the dirty work,"" he says.

This debate feels raw in part because it's happening within the Roman Catholic community, with some Catholic lawmakers breaking ranks with church leaders — and also because these crimes, while often decades old, are still coming to light.

In March, a Pennsylvania grand jury released a new report describing rape and sexual violence against hundreds of children by more than 50 priests in one diocese, Altoona-Johnstown.

""I'm a Catholic, but when that grand jury report came out it devastated our community, and there are still people trying to silence the victims now,"" says state Rep. Frank Burns, a Democrat.

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia declined to be interviewed for this story. The organization did send a letter to NPR saying there's nothing wrong with this kind of campaign, nothing wrong with priests sharing information about how Catholic lawmakers vote.

Their lobbying efforts have been effective. The bill expanding the statute of limitations for sex crimes against children died in New York's Legislature. A similar measure stalled in Pennsylvania's state Senate."

To a mathematician, it's a violent explosion that shoots out missiles of hot, wet air, slamming a turbulent cloud of moisture into anybody or anything that crosses its path.

To the rest of us, it's a sneeze.

And Lydia Bourouiba has made a career out of studying it. Bourouiba, a mathematical physicist, leads a research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that studies fluid dynamics. On Wednesday, her team published a slow-motion video of a sneeze in the New England Journal of Medicine.

It's mesmerizing. It's also important.

""Respiratory infectious diseases still remain the leading infectious diseases in the world,"" Bourouiba explains. Many of them hop from person to person in coughs and sneezes, or ""violent emissions,"" as she calls them. If she can understand how a sneeze moves, she says, she can better understand how to prevent microbes from moving from a sick person or contaminated surface to somebody else.

Shots investigates some of the myths and truths behind this commonplace bodily function in a special bonus story here. Enlarge this image toggle caption Library of Congress Library of Congress

But as the researchers watched videos of these mini-explosions, they quickly realized that a sneeze involves complicated physics.

""There's a whole range of droplet sizes in this cloud, and the cloud is made of hot and moist air,"" says Bourouiba. ""And it's turbulent, so that means that it has swirls and eddies, and it's moving very fast."" The conditions in the surrounding room — like airflow, moisture and temperature — can change how all those swirls and zigzags move, she says.

A lot of the sanitation measures we're all told to take to stay out of the way of someone else's sneeze are educated guesses at best, says Bourouiba. For example, people have assumed that standing a few feet away from a sick person would be enough to stay out of firing range. But Bourouiba and her colleagues found that the tiny droplets in a sneeze can, under certain conditions, travel across a room in just a few seconds. They can also hover in the air for many minutes.

""It's actually quite amazing that we can produce such a high-speed flow that contains all these ranges of sizes of droplets,"" Bourouiba says.

A sneeze is ""quite a fantastic tool for clearance,"" she adds, ""but also a fantastic tool to sustain the overall colonization of other bodies and other people with viruses and pathogens.""

To map the path of a sneeze — and of any infectious particles it might contain — Bourouiba had to become an expert in high-speed photography. So far, her subjects have been healthy sneezers. But now, Bourouiba and her colleagues have started enlisting the help of volunteers who have symptoms of a cold or flu, inviting these sick folks to sneeze in a special room that has controlled moisture, airflow and temperature, as well as camera equipment.

The ultimate goal of this study, she says, is to understand in detail how sneezes travel in different conditions.

""So, for example, in a typical hospital room, with a given ambient temperature and moisture and a given airflow, what is the ultimate distribution of the position of these droplets and the pathogens they contain?"" says Bourouiba. ""And if we change the room and ventilation and different environmental conditions, how does that change?""

Armed with that information, the researchers hope to make risk maps for which parts of a room are likely to get contaminated by a sick person, or figure out how far away a visitor needs to stand from a patient to stay out of the line of fire. The information might also improve the design of ventilation systems to help prevent infected droplets from dispersing through a building.

As for Bourouiba's own technique for squelching the spread of a cold, she recommends sneezing into your elbow. What's the physics there? The elbow reduces the cloud's momentum, she says, limiting how far those virus-filled droplets will travel."

Insurance assessors are on the ground in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, counting the material cost of the flooding. Renee Montagne talks to Mark Cockerham an assessor with State Farm.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

Many residents of the flooded areas of Louisiana are trying to figure out how to rebuild. Most who fled their homes don't have flood insurance, meaning they now have to navigate a complex state and federal aid system. For those who are covered for flooding, insurance assessors are now on the ground, helping them figure out what they're getting. Mark Cockerham has been coordinating work by assessors for State Farm Insurance, the biggest insurer in Louisiana. He joined us on the phone from Baton Rouge. Welcome.

MARK COCKERHAM: Thank you, Renee. Good to talk to you this morning.

MONTAGNE: Yes, and I do gather you have some 300 assessors out there working with customers on the ground in southern Louisiana. What kind of damage are you all seeing?

COCKERHAM: Yeah, you know, this is a significant event. You know, when we think about even a historical event, I think that's a very good description. And as I've been out, I would say that, you know, really just proud of the citizens of Louisiana - helping neighbors, helping friends and sometimes helping complete strangers recover from this in the early days now into a week or so later. It's been very inspiring.

MONTAGNE: If I'm a homeowner and have a policy with State Farm Insurance, what are the sorts of things that people should know and should be looking for in terms of what they might be insured for?

COCKERHAM: The homeowner's policy that most people have in this circumstance - first and foremost, it does not cover flood. Flood coverage is a separate coverage that is available to customers, whether they live in a flood zone or non-flood zone. It's underwritten by FEMA, but it is separate of the homeowner's. So if you think about your homeowner's coverage, it is really real damage - for example, leaks. The ground gets very saturated from these events, so you could have fallen debris - a tree falls on top of a house. So there are incidents like that where the homeowner's coverage would come into play. But flooding is separate coverage and separate of that.

MONTAGNE: Well, we got numbers from State Farm Insurance, and there have been, so far, 17,600 - approximately - auto claims and 7,300 home insurance claims, which makes this a much bigger auto insurance event than anything else.

COCKERHAM: It really does. Many vehicles are not only damaged at maybe offices or at homes, but some folks just had to leave their vehicles stranded on the road. You know, keep it in mind that about 4 out of 5 State Farm customers have comprehensive coverage, which does cover that vehicle and flood-type circumstance. But again, recognizing that a car doesn't have to take on a whole lot of water to become a fairly substantial loss.

MONTAGNE: Well, thank you very much for joining us.

COCKERHAM: Thank you very much.

MONTAGNE: Mark Cockerham is a vice president of State Farm Insurance, based in Baton Rouge.

Colombia's government and the country's biggest rebel group reached a deal Wednesday evening for ending a half-century of hostilities in what has been one of the world's longest-running armed conflicts.

The government's accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia must still be ratified by voters in a plebiscite in order to take effect.

But the announcement in Havana of a deal after four years of talks opens the possibility for Colombians to put behind them political bloodshed that has claimed more than 220,000 lives and driven more than 5 million people from their homes.

""I can die in peace because finally I'll see my country without violence with a future for my children,"" said Orlando Guevara, 57, crying as he watched the announcement on a giant TV screen with about 400 other people on a plaza in Colombia's capital. Some in the crowd waved white flags symbolizing peace and others held up the national flag.

The accord, whose final text has yet to be published, commits Colombia's government to carrying out aggressive land reform, overhauling its anti-narcotics strategy and greatly expanding the state into traditionally neglected areas of the country. But many sensitive details being worked out during around-the-clock sessions in recent days remain unknown and the joint statement read by the talks' Cuban and Norwegian sponsors was intended more to celebrate the conclusion of talks than offer new insights.

Negotiations began in November 2012 and were plagued by distrust built up during decades of war propaganda on both sides.

Polls say most Colombians loathe the rebel group known as the FARC and show no hesitation labeling them ""narco-terrorists"" for their heavy involvement in Colombia's cocaine trade, an association for which members of the group's top leadership have been indicted in the U.S. Meanwhile, the FARC held onto a Cold War view of Colombia's political and economic establishment as ""oligarchs"" at the service of the U.S.

The rebel army was forced to the negotiating table after a decade of heavy battlefield losses that saw a succession of top rebel commanders killed by the U.S.-backed military and the its ranks thinned by half to the current 7,000 troops.

President Juan Manuel Santos, an unlikely peacemaker given his role as architect of the military offensive, throughout maintained a steady pulse even as he was labeled a traitor by his conservative former allies and suffered a plunge in approval ratings.

The most contentious breakthrough came in September when the president traveled to Havana to lay out with FARC commander Rodrigo Londono a framework for investigating atrocities, punishing guerrillas for involvement in those abuses and offering compensation to victims.

Opponents of Santos and some human rights groups harshly criticized a key part of that deal: guerrillas who confess their crimes won't spend any time in prison and will instead be allowed to serve out reduced sentences of no more than eight years helping rebuild communities hit by the conflict.

Another toad to swallow, as Santos calls the concessions he's had to make, will be the sight of former rebel leaders occupying seats in congress specially reserved for the FARC's still unnamed political movement. The exact number of such seats was among the last details being hammered out in marathon 18-hour sessions taking place in recent days.

""We haven't slept but it was worth the effort,"" said Sen. Roy Barreras, among political reinforcements sent in by Santos to work on the deal, speaking to Caracol Radio from Havana.

The announcement that talks have successfully concluded trigger a series of events, some entailing political risks.

First, Santos must present the accords to congress and ask it to set a date for a plebiscite that could take place as early as next month. Details were expected when he addressed the nation in a televised appearance later Wednesday night. Polls show Colombians would likely endorse any deal in a simple yes or no vote.

But the still-unknown final accord may contain surprises and the opposition is likely to try to convert the vote into a referendum on Santos, whose approval rating plummeted to 21 percent in May according to a Gallup poll, the lowest since he took office in 2010.

Low voter turnout is also a concern because a minimum of 13 percent of the electorate, or about 4.4 million voters, must vote in favor for the accord to be ratified.

After the agreement is signed, the FARC will begin mobilizing its troops to 31 zones scattered across the country, and 90 days later they are supposed to begin handing their weapons over to United Nations-sponsored monitors.

But don't expect any immediate peace dividend or security improvements in Colombia's blood-splattered countryside.

Over the last 13 months, since the FARC declared a unilateral cease-fire and the government reciprocated with a truce of its own in all but name, violence has fallen to the lowest level since the FARC was created 52 years ago by outlaw peasant groups joined by communist activists. Only four deaths attributed to the FARC have been reported during that period and in the last 68 days the group hasn't carried out a single offensive action, according to a report last week by the Bogota-based Conflict Analysis Resource Center.

Analysts are concerned that as the rebels integrate into Colombian society, well-organized criminal gangs will fill the void and fight among themselves for control of the lucrative cocaine trade that kept the FARC well-armed much longer than other Latin American insurgencies.

While Colombia's homicide rate has fallen sharply over the years, it remains among the world's deadliest countries, with violence driven largely by its status as the world's top supplier of cocaine.

The much-smaller National Liberation Army will also remain active, although it's pursuing a peace deal of its own."

Tropical Storm Colin ripped across the Gulf of Mexico in June and hit the coast of southwest Florida with 60-mile-an-hour winds. Before it arrived, a team from the U.S. Geological Survey used a new computer model to predict how far inland the waves would invade. When the storm hit, the USGS sent Joe Long out to film it.

Long is an oceanographer with the USGS. His video shows waves rushing up the beach to the foot of a sand dune. ""So water levels are reaching that high,"" he says as we watch the video. ""They are eroding the face of that dune and creating this pretty steep face.""

Just beyond the dunes, you can see a multistory condominium. ""If that dune wasn't there,"" Long explains, ""that water would be going onto roadways or hitting the base of those buildings.""

When Long goes to the beach, he sees stuff the rest of us don't pay much attention to. He gets excited about ""dune toes"" (the base of a dune) and ""scarp formation"" (the creation of a steep dune face). He says he bores his kids at the beach.

But that attention to beach sculpting by ocean waves has helped him design a computer model that predicts something called ""wave run-up."" During storms, wind pushes a mass of water up toward a beach. That's called surge. But on top of that surge, wind creates waves that reach even higher — wave run-up.

Tropical Storm Colin hits Treasure Island, Fla., at Sunset Beach on June 6. The rising sea level and increased wave run-up created a steep beach scarp.

If they're big enough, these waves destroy the dune and wash huge amounts of sand close to shore — or they may carry the sand out to sea. ""The model we use is trying to predict the type of coastal change that we would see during a storm,"" Long explains.

The model is fairly new, but it predicted the level of wave run-up during Colin to within about a foot. It also nailed the amount of erosion the dunes would suffer.

One reason the geological survey has spent years perfecting this model is that the ocean is moving in on us. A warming planet is causing sea levels to rise. ""More storms could impact these protective dunes because sea levels are higher,"" he says.

Our coastlines are increasingly threatened.

And the survey is trying to predict how and where. Florida is near the top of the list. At the survey's offices in St. Petersburg, I walk downstairs to a dimly lit basement lab to visit marine biologist Ilsa Kuffner. She's a coral reef expert.

Shelves are packed with chunks of coral Kuffner has collected. Her job is to find out what happens to waves before they get to the beaches. ""The main thrust of our project,"" she says, ""is looking at reefs being barriers that are protecting coastlines.""

Reefs slow down incoming swells and waves. The problem is that warmer ocean temperatures are killing a lot of coral, so coral beds shrink down, away from the sea surface. In effect, the water depth increases. ""So there's less drag,"" Kuffner says. ""More wave energy can propagate over the reef, so they're not performing as well as breakwaters.""

Then, when waves do reach the shore, their effects depend on a lot of things — how steep the beach is, for example, or how high the dunes are. The west coast of Florida, it turns out, isn't very sturdy. ""The Gulf is in a really bad state,"" says Hilary Stockdon, a USGS oceanographer and one of the designers of the model. She says beaches and dunes along the Gulf of Mexico are flat and low, and even a small hurricane would do a lot of damage.

""A direct landfall of a Category 1 [hurricane] almost anywhere in the Gulf of Mexico will cause significant coastal erosion,"" Stockdon says. That threatens wetlands and barrier islands, as well as roads and buildings.

The team's computer models factor in predictions about the rise in sea level and show lots of places along the East and the Gulf coasts that are increasingly threatened.

""Water is just going to start reaching places that it hasn't reached before,"" Stockdon says, ""and if they don't consider this wave run-up, they're going to miss this important part.""

""They"" are weather forecasters and emergency response teams from Maine to Mississippi. Stockdon says some are already using the model to prepare.

That makes Nathaniel Plant happy. Plant is the top USGS oceanographer on this project, and he says the goal is to help people prepare — to know where it's going to flood, and also where the waves can't be stopped.

""As a nation, we actually have to decide,"" Plant says: ""What areas are we going to invest in to protect? What areas are we going to let go on their own?""

In some places, he says, the waves are going to win.

Science reporters at NPR are exploring all sorts of waves this summer. Stay tuned for more more of our favorites."

(The only criterion for membership, according to the Krewe's website, is ""that you know about it."") By day's end, St. Anne's has made its way down to the riverbank, where paraders who've lost loved ones in the past year scatter the ashes of the departed over the Mississippi's waters. Like a funeral ceremony's second line, the ritual smudges the distinction between mourning and celebration.

""St. Anne's Parade,"" the new single from Americana duo Shovels & Rope's forthcoming album Little Seeds, likewise embraces a glorious muddle of joy and grief — the beauty of life despite the certainty of death. ""Sang out our hearts while they sent away their dead,"" Cary Ann Hearst and Michael Trent sing in compelling harmony, describing the parade's end. ""The sun shone on the river, we began our lives instead.""

Duality isn't unfamiliar subject matter for Hearst and Trent, who are wife and husband as well as musical partners. They've often explored the fine lines between good and evil, sacred and sinful, in songs that function as complex character studies. What's surprising is the open fragility the duo conveys, with their voices sounding ragged over a delicate patchwork of mandolin, sparse piano and touches of reverb-y guitar. It culminates in the song's refrain, sung so it feels like it's breaking from emotion: ""This life may be too good to survive.""

The video for ""St. Anne's Parade"" was directed by The Moving Picture Boys, a.k.a. Jace Freeman and Sean Clark of Nashville, Tenn., who also created a 2014 documentary about Shovels & Rope. Between backlit shots of the duo singing at a vintage microphone, the video depicts an actual Krewe of St. Anne foot parade in which Trent, Hearst and friends, adorned with glittering Mardi Gras beads, are participants. ""Friends of ours had a 'The Owl And The Pussycat'-themed wedding party that marched with St. Anne's,"" Hearst and Trent tell NPR via email. ""They took their vows on the riverbank while the sun shone down on a previously rainy morning. Everyone was feeling sweet and love was all around.""

Little Seeds is out Oct. 7 via New West."

On a Saturday morning, a group of adults gather in a circle in an elementary school classroom on the campus of Gallaudet University. Each wears a name tag — and on that name tag is a common sexual term: ""Ejaculation."" ""Orgasm."" ""Condom.""

One by one they introduce themselves by the name on their tag. Not in spoken words, but in American Sign Language (ASL).

These are parents and caregivers who have — or work with — children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The moms and dads are bashful at first, but after signing for a few minutes, they're laughing at themselves.

Let's face it: Talking about sex can be awkward. Having ""the talk"" is hard enough — but throw in ASL, and a lot of adults — whether it's a teacher in the classroom or mom and dad at home — can be completely stumped.

While the speaking world has convenient euphemisms for much of this stuff, in ASL some of the signs are, to put it mildly, pretty graphic. And that can make teachers and parents very uncomfortable.

""There's a fear of, especially in ASL, the signs being pretty explicit at times, so desensitization is really key,"" says Matthew Rider-Barclay. He works at the Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center at Gallaudet University.

He designs classes, workshops and seminars at Gallaudet — the liberal arts university in Washington, D.C. — and across the country, for students who are deaf or hard of hearing. His seminars are aimed at helping family members and professionals working with deaf children communicate effectively.

So is the workshop Tara Miles is leading at Kendall Demonstration Elementary School, a school for the deaf. Getting parents to open up about sex is a tricky task, she says, so she tries to bring humor to the process.

After the class wraps up, Miles notes that many of the parents visibly relaxed: ""It was nice to see them get to a place where they could put down their rigidity and be calm.""

In the U.S. around 3 in 1,000 children are born with a detectable level of hearing loss, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD). And more than 90 percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents.

That creates a problem for parents who don't know sign language fluently.

Rider-Barclay and other colleagues at Gallaudet have taken on this challenge in a big way.

How? By showing teachers of deaf students how to be more comfortable talking to their students about sex and sexuality. They also train instructors who work in mainstream classrooms with both deaf or hard-of-hearing students and normal-hearing students.

One of the first things to teach: getting comfortable with the signs. Many common terms used in sex education exist in ASL quite literally — gestures that seem to mimic the act being described. For other explicit terms, there isn't a sign at all.

""Herpes doesn't have a sign, so you finger-spell it,"" explains Christine Gannon, director of health and wellness programs at Gallaudet.

But, she adds, sign language can also be an improvement over spoken words.

""The great thing about ASL though is, I can finger-spell herpes and then I can be more descriptive using my hands,"" Gannon says. ""So I can provide a visual access to what it looks like, to the symptoms that it might cause by using hands, which is a definite advantage for the deaf community over the hearing community.""

Rosina Garcia, a rising fourth-year Gallaudet student, agrees. ""It's easier to describe [sex ed terms], and we can take it from there to the English word,"" she says through an interpreter. ""That way you don't miss any of the information.""

Christine Gannon notes that while there are lots of sex-ed resources online, the vast majority are not tailored to a deaf audience. And most videos aren't subtitled or accessible for young deaf people. That's frustrating for an educator like Gannon, who says she's constantly trying to bring her teaching techniques into the digital age.

Her colleague Matthew Rider-Barclay puts it this way: Sex education for the deaf is like being plopped down in a foreign country where you don't speak the language.

""The materials are going to be really well-suited to the people in that country,"" he says, ""but it's not going to be accessible to you."""

Australia has a controversial policy of intercepting refugees and migrants at sea and sending them to detention centers, paid for by Australia, in remote island nations. One of those centers is on Nauru, a tiny speck in the Pacific Ocean with just 10,000 citizens.

The refugees and migrants come from many troubled countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, and some of them, including children, have complained of abuse at the Australian camp on Nauru.

Australia's immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has played down these allegations, claiming most are about small issues, and reiterating that the asylum seekers will not be allowed to come to Australia. He argues that such a move would give ""smugglers a green light.""

Nauru The tiny island nation is just eight square miles and has just 10,000 citizens.

But Viktoria Vibhakar, a former aid worker for Save The Children Australia, says abuse is a serious problem at the detention camp and has been largely ignored. She was hired to work in Nauru in 2013, and spent a year coming and going to the island.

""One of the first things I got, which was the most striking, was a deed of confidentiality, which was a couple pages and it basically said, you cannot say anything about what goes on in this facility and if you do, you are liable for two years in jail for each disclosure.""

Vibhakar spoke by Skype with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep.

""In the beginning we'd go out to the detention facility, which is basically a place of barren rock, phosphate rock, with jagged pinnacles with little natural vegetation and very bright light because the glare of the sun is incredibly oppressive,"" she said. ""The asylum seekers were housed in vinyl tents, and we would go and meet with them and ask them how they were doing, and Steve, as time went on I felt like my job was just convincing people to stay alive.""

What was the first case that came to your attention that made you think something is seriously wrong here?

""Three days into my first rotation on Nauru there was an adolescent boy who had been sexually assaulted. The child was living in fear of this sexual assault being repeated not just to him but to his mother who was living without a partner in the detention facility.""

Who was the alleged abuser, according to the victims?

""So it was an employee who was a cleaner. And he actually admitted to the sexual assault, and while the security guards were making note of the sexual assault and taking the boy's report, the person who sexually assaulted the young boy continued to mock him. And see there was a complete lack of privacy in this detention facility, so here is a boy having to report a sexual assault and he is doing it in the open air, in front of guards, while the abuser is standing there mocking him. And see what was really amazing to me is here was a Save the Children manager there and she told me at the time that this person was going to be moved to a different detention facility within Nauru but that he wasn't going to be fired. And she said this just as a matter of, this was just normal, you have to accept it, this is just the way it is.""

[Vibhakar went on to say the employee was eventually fired.]

What were you supposed to do when you were told of abuse?

""We were supposed to fill out an incident report immediately, but see, there was no child protection agency in Nauru so there was no statutory protection function. And the biggest issue about children and their safety was that we were never allowed to remove them from harm. So the Australian government never gave Save the Children the authority to remove children if they felt that they were unsafe. Reporting abuse is not adequate if the child is still subjected to further abuse. But this was the case in Nauru.""

Did anyone have the authority to remove a child from harm?

""Only the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of the government Australia and they refused.""

Did they have people there?

""Yes, they did but they interacted almost very rarely with asylum seekers and they refused to remove children.""

What did you do when it became apparent, in your view, that there was widespread abuse and that nobody was doing anything about it?

""So there was an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into children and immigration detention which is the human rights government agency in Australia. They had called this inquiry and after reviewing the information that my organization had provided voluntarily to this inquiry, I found that it lacked very important details, namely they failed to disclose the physical and sexual assault of children and the lack of safety of children.""

So Save the Children Australia was questioned by this inquiry and didn't pass on information so far as you could tell, that you knew?

""Yes. That's correct.""

So what did you do?

""I chose to make a report, an anonymous report to the [Australian] Human Rights Commission detailing the abuse and systemic violations of human right to children and families on Nauru and I attached several thousand pages of documentation as well and I sent it to the commission.""

How physically did you send those several thousand documents?

""I did it by mail ... I wore a baseball cap and wore sunglasses and went to a post office farther from my house and paid cash because I was so scared of the Australian government.""

So did you have a moment as that package went through the slot, well, that's two years in jail?

""I had many of those moments. Because it's, each disclosure is two years in jail so I had many, many of those scary moments and, of course, I was eventually referred to the Australian federal police with nine other of my colleagues.""

Her documents are among many that have now been leaked about the abuse of refugees on the island of Nauru. As it happened, the Australian police never came for Vibhakar. But she did lose her job with Save the Children. That organization said Australia only let it serve the refugees, if it kept its work confidential. What, if anything, has changed for the better?

""Well I have to be honest, in Nauru, it's only gotten worse. Their mental health has deteriorated and hopelessness and the despair has increased. The this is undisputed by the Australian government. They know that this is causing harm."""

Aref al-Krez has the look of a young, laid-back guy with well-coiffed hair, stylish clothes and carefully cultivated stubble.

But the 24-year-old Syrian refugee and father of a young daughter has a world of worries about her future and his role in it.

Like so many Syrians now living in Turkey, Krez faces huge bureaucratic hurdles while trying to obtain the right government-issued documents that prove his daughter is actually his.

His daughter Perla, age 2, has an uncertain legal status in Turkey, limiting both her rights and future opportunities, like so many of the Syrian children born in Turkey to refugee parents.

Turkey has taken in far more Syrian refugees than any other country — 2.7 million refugees since the Syrian war began in 2011, according to the United Nations refugee agency. But Turkey isn't making it easy for them to put down roots and build new lives.

For starters, Turkey does not legally consider them ""refugees."" Rather, the Turkish government calls them ""guests."" As a result, Syrian children born in Turkey are not given citizenship and face great difficulty in obtaining even basic identity documents.

In his small apartment in Gaziantep, the de facto capital of Turkey's Syrian exile community, Krez details the difficulties he's already had in trying to get his family's paperwork in order.

""I'm very worried,"" he says, smiling at Perla, who's doing an impromptu dance. ""I don't want her to be stuck in this vague system her whole life. I want her to have the opportunity to reach her dreams.""

Without a well-defined legal status, be it citizenship or just residency, Perla will be unable to legally leave the country for study or work.

Documents that refer to just one parent

In the short term, she lacks papers that define her relationship to her mother and father. In Turkey, many Syrian children who are born in Turkish hospitals are identified as having only one parent, the mother, leaving the children in a legal limbo that limits the family's options for the future.

Krez says that because his daughter isn't legally registered as his by the Turkish government, he's afraid to travel too far with her, for fear his family might reach a checkpoint where he can't prove his relation to Perla.

Perla's identification difficulties will be compounded later. Under the current law in Turkey, the children of Syrian refugees can't obtain a Turkish passport, making it impossible for them to legally leave and re-enter the country.

""Being a Syrian is like being a criminal,"" Krez laments, adding that those without any identifying documents are even worse off than he. ""They are like nobodies. No travel. No work. No respect.""

It's also exceptionally frustrating. The road to obtaining the proper paperwork begins for many Syria refugees with a seemingly insurmountable Catch-22.

First, Syrians need to show Turkish authorities their ""Family Book,"" a passport-shaped booklet that records a family's marriages and births. Syrians who escaped the fighting with their Family Book issued by the Syrian government can often obtain the Turkish equivalent.

Another essential document for Syrians in Turkey is the guest registration card known as a ""Kimlik,"" which gives the bearer access to health care and other government services like education.

The Kimlik is theoretically available to any Syrian who arrives in Turkey with an accepted form of Syrian ID — even a student ID will do. However, the Kimlik system is extremely slow in providing Syrian refugees with this document, and Turkish officials acknowledge the system is overwhelmed with requests.

The dizzying paperwork process is even more difficult for those who were forced to flee Syria without proper identification. They face a brick wall that can only, sometimes, be circumvented with a payment to the right official or finding someone back in Syria to get them a Family Book.

Such efforts can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, money most Syrian refugees don't have.

No documents, no opportunities

Taher Hamada is an agricultural engineer by trade facing that very decision. He fled the fighting in Aleppo with his wife, who gave birth four months ago in Turkey to a baby girl named Tamara.

Hamada, 34, came to Turkey without a Syrian passport or Family Book, just an ID card, which means he can't obtain a Turkish Family Book, hampering his ability to plan for his family's future.

He's considered buying a Syrian passport on the black market, which would cost about $8,000.

His high hopes for Tamara — a good education and freedom of movement — seem out of reach unless Hamada can get the documents she needs to solidify her status in Turkey.

The right paperwork would also allow him to take a good job he was offered in Saudi Arabia. As it stands, Hamada can't prove his daughter is his, making it impossible for him to travel, since none of them have a valid passport.

Yet he remains optimistic, even thankful, considering how much worse things are at home in Syria.

""How do people who are worse off than me survive?"" says Hamada. ""I am lucky.""

Muhanned Najjar is a researcher for a German newsmagazine who arrived in Turkey with just a local Syrian marriage certificate to prove his union with his wife.

Without a Syrian Family Book, there's little hope he'll obtain the Turkish version that legally proves his parentage to his two small children born in Turkey.

For now, he has a steady salary, which invites the occasional thought of forgoing the complicated document procurement process, packing up his family and braving the waters off the Turkish coast in hopes of reaching Europe. Many have already made that trip, though thousands have drowned in the last year alone.

""At night, I think, 'I will take my family to Europe on the boat,'"" says Najjar, chain smoking and shaking his head. But during the light of day, he brushes off the idea, knowing he doesn't want to risk their lives. He also realizes he couldn't go it alone because without the proper papers, his family might never be able to join him.

""I don't see how I could possibly be hopeful for the future,"" he says."

Could Be You're Depressed

Vincent Van Gogh's paintings might not make it obvious that he was an artist troubled with depression and mania. But a computer algorithm might be able to figure that out. Computer programs are getting pretty good at discovering health information by studying heaps of social media data.

A computer script analyzed galleries of photos posted to Instagram and accurately predicted if the users had depression, according to a study posted this month to the public online repository arXiv.com.

The researchers asked 166 Instagram users for permission to analyze their posts and also asked whether or not they had a diagnosis of clinical depression from a mental health professional. First, the researchers had their algorithm just sort 70 percent of the information to find out what photo features are common among people with depression and people without depression.

The program looked through four distinct categories of information: color and brightness, number of faces in the photo, use of Instagram filters, and metadata including number of comments or likes. ""In general, each one of these things has some relationship to what people have already found in studying depression,"" says Andrew Reece, the lead author and a psychology and computational science graduate student at Harvard University.

For example, there's some research that suggests people with depression prefer darker colors and more grays or blues. ""There's evidence people who are depressed tend to interact in smaller social settings. If there's a ton of faces in the photos, then it probably means you're interacting in large social settings,"" Reece says. The same might be true for the number of likes or comments someone gets for their posts.

The program was able to find associations in the Instagram data that backed these theories up. Photos from people with depression tend to be bluer, darker and grayer. ""[People with depression] tend to have more comments on their posts, but fewer likes.

Depressed people were less likely to use any filters at all, but when they did use filters they went for Inkwell, which makes everything black and white,"" Reece says. ""And depressed people have fewer faces in their photos, but they tend to post more photos with faces.""

Bluer, Grayer, Darker Enlarge this image toggle caption Cornell University Cornell University

Then Reece and his coauthor removed the depression diagnosis information from their remaining untouched Instagram photos. They gave those to the computer program and had the machine figure out which of those users had depression and which of them didn't. ""We were right about people being healthy 84 percent of the time. About a third of the people who were truly depressed, the machine found,"" Reece says.

When the machine gave a depression marker, it was right about 54 percent of the time, compared to unassisted primary physicians who correctly make a depression diagnosis about 42 percent of the time. ""It's not an A+, but it's a 25 percent improvement over those human rates,"" Reece says.

This study hasn't been peer reviewed, but it looks like the algorithm is doing a a fairly good job. Reece says it doesn't mean that computer programs are going to replace primary doctors when it comes to diagnosing depression. Primary doctors look at the general population, rather than just Instagram users, and don't separate people into binary categories like depression or no depression like the program does. ""You can't even really compare the two in a formal sense,"" Reece says.

And the algorithm can't truly diagnose someone with depression or rule it out the way a psychologist or psychiatrist would. Ideally, programs like this might help clinicians quickly find people who are struggling and need help. Right now, Reece says that patients wait several months on average between depression sets in and treatment. ""If someone is depressed and really needs services, and they don't get that assessment, anything that can help them get assessed is good,"" he says.

And computers are able to look at vast amounts of social media information, something which a doctor could never do. Researchers have created computer scripts that can parse out signs of depression from Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr feeds. That means a program like this could provide useful information that doctors otherwise wouldn't have, says Munmun De Choudhury, a social and computer scientist at Georgia Tech who was not involved in this study. ""The goal lies in empowering the clinician with tools that would help people manage or cope with these challenges above and beyond what they're currently using.""

But we aren't quite there yet, says Dr. Megan Moreno, an adolescent psychiatrist at Seattle Children's Hospital who studies social media and mental illness. ""We're probably still a ways away from having these types of approaches normalized as part of clinical care,"" she says. ""I think this is a cool and interesting piece to the puzzle.""

Actually using this information for depression screening comes with legal and privacy issues. ""We're talking about the perspective that we could find people who need help. There's so much hope and optimism, but if we develop ways to monitor [social media data], then who else will monitor?"" Moreno says. ""Could these things come back and affect someone's employment or insurability? To some extent, people assume some of that is already happening.""

Companies could already be collecting the data for this type of use. After all, Tweets, Tumblr and many Instagram posts are freely available to anyone with an Internet connection."

They call it the octobot.

The squishy eight-legged robot described in the journal Nature is made entirely out of soft, flexible materials, runs on hydrogen peroxide, and looks like a 2-centimeter-tall baby octopus.

It is a step forward for robotics, which has long relied on machines with hard skeletons (think The Terminator), or at least with rigid moving parts (like this other octopus-like guy designed by the Italian robot scientist Cecilia Laschi).

In their paper, the authors say the systems behind their invention, which you can watch move in the video below, ""may serve as a foundation for a new generation of completely soft, autonomous robots.""

YouTube

Here are the basic steps to build a squishy robot that runs on a household disinfectant.

First, build the robot brain. In this case, the logical engine of the machine looks like a flexible silicone wafer about a millimeter thick. On top of the wafer are a series of microscopic fluid channels connected into a circuit, kind of like a computer circuit board that controls liquid instead of electricity.

Next, the brain needs a body. The robot engineers took the wafer brain and put it into a mold shaped like a little octopus, which is the animal that inspired the design. Then they used 3-D printing and lithography to lay down multiple squishy materials that became the body and legs of the robot. On the top side of the legs, the material is very elastic, which allows the legs to curl up.

Lastly, the body needs fuel. The octobot runs on a 50 percent hydrogen peroxide solution, which is much stronger than the consumer product; the over-the-counter concentration is usually less than 5 percent. The peroxide fuel goes into two tiny reservoirs in the body of the robot, where it flows into the channels of the ""brain."" As it reacts with platinum in the walls of the channels, the fluid breaks down into water and oxygen gases.

This video shows what the chemical reaction looks like when two different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide break down into gases.

YouTube

The gases take up about 160 times more space than the liquid fuel did, and as they move through the channels and out into the legs, the legs bend to accommodate the gas. Right now, the octobot can flex and unflex its legs for for four to 8 minutes on 1 milliliter of fuel.

And that's it: the robot isn't designed to do anything in particular. It's an early proof-of-concept design. But future soft robots could squeeze into tight spaces or gently touch humans.

Barry Trimmer, a roboticist at Tufts University and the editor-in-chief of the journal Soft Robotics, writes in an email to NPR, ""Soft robots and soft material technologies are definitely needed if we expect to deploy autonomous machines in the home or in natural environments. They have the potential to be more robust, safe and biocompatible than current robots.""

He says although the octobot may not appear to do much, he is impressed by how the research team uses fluids to power it, and excited about what their technique could mean for future autonomous robots.

""This is an ingenious approach to building and controlling a completely soft robot,"" he writes. ""The octobot is an inspiration for those of us trying to make better and safer robots."""

It has been three years since The Office wrapped, and actor John Krasinski, who played Jim Halpert, is still feeling lucky. Landing a role on the NBC comedy series had been an unfathomably big break for the actor, whose previous work had been in a series of commercials and off-Broadway plays.

""I take stock of the fact every single day that I'm living a lottery-ticket life,"" he tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. ""It's so unbelievably rare to get the opportunity that I did to be on The Office, so what I try to do instead is try to deserve to stay here. That's why I branched out to do writing and directing and producing.""

Krasinski's latest project is directing and co-starring in the new film The Hollars. He plays a man who returns home when his mother, played by Margo Martindale, is hospitalized with a brain tumor.

Krasinski says that Martindale's role as the family matriarch was crucial to the film's creation. ""This part is the centerpiece of the movie, and Margo is the centerpiece of the cast,"" he says. ""As soon as she signed on, I knew we had something special.""

Interview Highlights

On directing veteran actors Margo Martindale and Richard Jenkins in The Hollars

Everybody in this cast was so good. I actually remember actually asking Matt Damon about his experience with Clint Eastwood, and he told me this story about how it was so terrifying working with Clint Eastwood because he only did one or two takes. And one day, Matt said, ""Could I ever do another one?"" and Clint said, ""Anytime you want to do another take, you can, but I'm fine, because I hired you to be the actor I knew you could be.""

I thought that was really interesting, and certainly on this film that applied here, which is, I hired these people that I knew would absolutely shine in these roles, and they certainly did. So it was less about trying to get them to achieve a performance, and much more about trying to create an environment where they could feel safe and empowered to do that performance.

On Martindale playing the matriarch

Very few people are able to communicate a sense of reality. It's almost like she's not acting, certainly in this movie, she's just living through this experience that I think a lot of families have experienced, to have a parent be ill. She brings such humanity and grace to the situation that you feel that you're not watching a movie. At least I sometimes feel like I'm not watching a movie. It almost becomes like you're watching a home movie, and that's a very rare thing to be able to communicate, that she feels like your mom.

I was more of the geeky comedy nerd than anything.

I always loved the energy that was coming off Saturday Night Live and things like that.

Growing up, I think that performance and trying to be more of the class clown or trying to be funny for my family was all I really cared about, but I never had the intention of being an actor. Actually, when I went to college I was dead set on being an English teacher, which again, probably came from a movie. I probably saw Dead Poets Society and said, ""Oh yeah, just get kids to stand on desks, that sounds like a good life!""

On how his parents reacted when he decided to pursue acting

I remember my parents came to the final performance at this theater school, and the next morning we were driving home, and I hadn't talked about this with them at all, and I just said in the back of the car, I said, ""I want to move to New York and be an actor.""

And without hesitation my mom said, ""Great. Just promise me one thing: That in 2 1/2, three years, if you don't have a bite, if there's not that idea that maybe something's coming, you have to pull yourself out of it, because the only thing you can't ask me to do as your mom is tell her son to give up on his dreams."" I thought that was the most profound, unbelievable invitation, and the kindest way to send me out there.

Sure enough, 2 1/2 years later, I actually did call my mom and say, ""Well, I gave it a shot. You were right, nothing's really happening."" I had done some commercials and some off- off- off-Broadway plays, and I said, ""I'm ready to pull out, you were right."" And it was about September when I called her, and then she said, ""Oh, it's September, just finish out the year!"" And three weeks later I got The Office.

On auditioning for the role of Jim Halpert on The Office

I was sitting in line, it was bit of a bizarro, alternate universe feeling, sitting next to six other people who looked exactly like you. And we were all going in for the role of Jim, and they went through the line of the six guys and I was the last person, and the casting director came up and said, ""You know, we're just going to take a break for lunch."" ... So I watched, you know, 50 to 60 people leave the office. ...

They went down to the restaurant, came back up with salads and sandwiches, all these people came back and one guy sat across from me and said, ""Are you nervous?"" And I said, ""Oh no, you either get these things, or you don't. What I'm really nervous about is them screwing up a perfect show. The Americans always have the ability to screw up these amazing British shows and I'm afraid this is going to be another one of them.""

And he said, ""Oh great. I'm Greg Daniels, I'm the executive producer."" And I genuinely almost threw up right on his shoes. ... He later said, ""Honesty is the best policy. It's the reason you got the role.""

I think he's still just being nice. I won't dare try it again by going into auditions now saying, ""I think this movie's going to be horrible,"" and then see if they give me the role.

On breaking character and laughing during takes

I'm the least professional actor you can meet when it comes to breaking. I laugh all the time. There are way too many outtakes of me laughing, and I believe, as the Internet has confirmed, I laugh, I think, like a ""little princess,"" is the quote? I laugh like a little princess. ... When I break that much I, for some reason, have a very high-pitched register that I got to say, I embrace it.

On his on- and off-screen rivalry with Dwight (Rainn Wilson) on The Office

I think the rivalry made us become kind of like brothers. I mean, there's that rivalry between brothers, obviously, and it's not necessarily competitive, it's just this free-spirited thing. ...

One of the things that I got nervous about was play fighting with him, because he's a very good actor, but I, for some reason, would always end up injured when we did any play fighting. So there were all these scenes where he would throw snowballs at me and it actually hurt, or he'd go to push me and he'd push me too hard, and I'd actually get hurt. ...

After years and years and years of him doing all these things to me, there was one time where I'm walking through a door and I slap him in the face, and there was no way to fake that, because I had to actually slap him. I had in my head, ""This is my full payback for all these years."" And Rainn said, ""Listen, you can hit me as hard as you need to, don't worry about it."" And I said, ""OK.""

And so the scene you see in the show is as hard as I've ever hit a human being before, and I have no idea why I took that opportunity, other than it was that brotherly thing of ""I can't let this happen."" So if you go back and watch that scene, you will see Rainn genuinely stunned by how hard I hit him.

I'll never forget ... the cameramen barely remain standing they were laughing so hard, but the assistant cameramen who stand right next to the camera guys making sure they don't bump into anything, fell down on the floor laughing. ... At that moment, I was no longer Jim and he was no longer Dwight, that was John and Rainn's moment."

The Atlanta Journal Constitution says the medical profession is plagued by doctors' sexual misconduct, and they're often allowed to keep practicing. David Greene talks to the paper's Carrie Teegardin.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

When we visit a doctor, we inevitably make ourselves vulnerable. Most physicians would never betray that trust. But a new investigative report by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reveals that many do.

Carrie Teegardin is part of the team that spent a year digging into medical board documents from all 50 states. We should warn you that what she found might be disturbing to some listeners. She told us one story of a doctor in Kentucky who was caught sexually abusing his patient.

CARRIE TEEGARDIN: She has an infection on her abdomen. And the doctor is looking at that and then comments that - oh, she has sexy underwear. Then he starts rubbing her genitals and places his mouth there.

I mean, the patient had to push him away. When she confronted him later while being tape recorded, his comment was - it was so beautiful, I just couldn't resist. And that physician was returned to practice.

GREENE: Is practicing today.

TEEGARDIN: Yes.

GREENE: How did that happen?

TEEGARDIN: Well, that's how the system works.

GREENE: Under the system in some states, when abusive doctors are reported to medical boards, they don't always lose their jobs. In fact, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that medical regulators increasingly view sexual misconduct by doctors as the symptom of an impairment rather than cause for punishment. The doctors are sent to therapy. Often, their licenses are quickly reinstated.

TEEGARDIN: Often, they're required to take lie detector tests where they're asked, you know, have you done anything inappropriate with patients? They have to have a chaperone in the room. But they don't have to tell their patients why that person is there.

You would have no idea in most cases. We also found that a lot of what's going on - the extent of it is a knowable for us. We've found hundreds, thousands of cases.

But we also found that doctors are disciplined by the medical boards in private orders - may be required to do certain things. But there would be absolutely no way that potential patients would even know.

GREENE: Are there people defending the status quo and saying this is just a reality that everyone needs to deal with?

TEEGARDIN: Oh, definitely. This is how these cases have been handled. And they think they've been handled very successfully. They say that the treatment is very effective and that once doctors have gone through this, it's unlikely that they will reoffend. Throughout our reporting, we were reminded of the scandal in the Catholic Church.

GREENE: You're making the comparison because one of the arguments was that priests who committed the sexual assaults - that they were ill and that it wasn't necessarily a crime. And that should be handled as an illness to be treated.

TEEGARDIN: And they were sent to another parish. And then the same thing would happen again. I think what we noticed was - OK, if this were a teacher - these days, if this were a priest - if this were a coach, would we say it's OK for you to go off and get treatment and then come back to the classroom?

Every other part of society - we have very little tolerance for sexual misconduct. And so I think that's what struck us as so unique about the way these cases were handling. It was a special privilege. You know, doctors have privileges. They have a lot of trust.

And they have a lot of training. But we also found that they were kind of enjoying a special privilege in how these allegations tended to be handled.

GREENE: I mean, there are times when you hear people who have been assaulted say that they did not want to go to the police for different reasons. You know, a medical board - is it their place to actually go to the police? Or does that become really problematic here?

TEEGARDIN: In some states, they're required to notify police if they feel a crime has taken place. In other states, they're not. And some ethicists and medical board members feel that that should be left up to the patient. The patient's identity is generally, in terms of public documents, protected.

GREENE: I mean, if people are listening and wondering about if this could ever happen to them, do you have some advice on what they could do - what they should do?

TEEGARDIN: One thing that is really important is that if your doctor - especially a doctor of the opposite sex - is doing an exam on your intimate parts, that person should have another person in the room. There should be a medical assistant, a nurse.

GREENE: And you feel like that's something reasonably that you could ask for if you're a patient. Just say, I would feel more comfortable if...

TEEGARDIN: It's expected in most states to have a, quote, ""chaperone"" in the room, again, if it's an opposite-sex physician. Some doctors feel it's appropriate even if it's a same-sex physician. And I think that's expected.

GREENE: Carrie Teegardin, thank you very much for talking to us about this.

TEEGARDIN: Thank you, David. I really appreciate it.

GREENE: Carrie Teegardin is an investigative reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The paper has a series out this week on doctors and sex abuse.

In the their new book, Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money and Power, Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher of The Washington Post tell the story of Donald Trump's rise as a businessman, a political candidate, but above all, as a brand.

This sentence from the book captures the proliferation of the Trump brand:

""Trump summoned reporters to a press conference at Trump's Bar, located on the ground floor of Trump Tower, close to Trump Grill, just steps away form Trump's Ice Cream Parlor and the Trump Store, which was then pushing a new cologne for men called, Donald Trump, the Fragrance.""

Kranish and Fisher write the point of that press conference was to announce Trump University.

Some people psychoanalyze Trump and attribute this self-magnification of the man into a brand as a form of narcissism. But Kranish and Fisher take a more strategic view of him than that.

The authors told NPR's Robert Siegel that Trump has encouraged an outsize image of himself so that he can profit from just being Donald Trump.

""Obviously, the Trump brand is what makes him,"" Kranish says. ""He has from his very early days been told by his father not to be a nothing, that he has to be something and something big. And Donald Trump has spent so much of his life trying to outdo his father and be his own man. So being Trump, being Trump on the buildings, Trump in universities, this is all part of who Donald is.

""He's written about the power of narcissism — there's a book by that title that he cites, glowingly — and he says, 'You have to look at the world that way as a businessperson. You have to put yourself front and center.' And that's the way he's operated.""

The Clinton Foundation, a big organization that has led to big political headaches for Bill and Hillary Clinton, plans to spin off its international work if Hillary is elected president.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And that is some news on the Democratic side. Donna Shalala, the president of the Clinton Foundation, told NPR yesterday that if Hillary Clinton is elected in November, the foundation will spin off its international operations and dramatically reduce its budget. This means the foundation, which Bill Clinton built into a wide-ranging charity with a global presence, could become much smaller. NPR's Peter Overby has the report.

PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: There's no escaping the politics in this. Here's Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump last night in Austin, Texas.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: This is corruption, and this is why I have called for a special prosecutor to look into this mess.

OVERBY: The Clinton Foundation has been under heavy attack since Clinton announced she was running more than a year ago. These changes at the foundation would eliminate some of the biggest targets, not that Donna Shalala, the foundation's president, put it that way.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

DONNA SHALALA: We have lots of partners around the world, and they will continue the work that was started by the Clinton Foundation.

OVERBY: She told NPR the foundation has been planning this for months - the transfer of its international programs to other existing non-governmental organizations or to newly created ones if Hillary Clinton is elected.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SHALALA: This kind of unraveling has to be done with a scalpel so that we just do not hurt people and do not interrupt the very good work that's being done.

OVERBY: The Clinton Foundation has an annual budget of $250 million. It's unique in the reach of its programs and the number of partners - other nonprofits and philanthropists - it engages. Much of its money comes from international donors, philanthropists, public officials, even nations. Those international connections also generate much of the controversy surrounding the foundation.

If Hillary Clinton is elected, the foundation then will stop accepting contributions from foreign donors and from American corporations. What's left after the downsizing would be the Clinton Presidential Library and Center in Little Rock and a few other domestic programs. One example - the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, which the Clinton Foundation helps underwrite. The changes also means a dramatically shrinking role for Bill Clinton, who launched the foundation 20 years ago.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SHALALA: Everything that we're spinning off or merging with another organization, he will not be involved.

OVERBY: Again, Donna Shalala.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SHALALA: He's coming off the board of the foundation, but he's also coming off any relationship with any of these spin-offs or these new partner organizations.

OVERBY: Bill Clinton would stop fundraising, too - again, if his wife becomes president. That would leave their daughter, Chelsea, as the only Clinton on the Clinton Foundation board. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington.

Corporate social responsibility has been added to the growing list of demands that investors, customers and employees present to companies.

In 2015, 81 percent of Fortune 500 companies published sustainability reports, up from 20 percent in 2011, according to a report released by the Governance & Accountability Institute in June. Companies are publicizing their ethical standards and responsibility efforts, and consumers are punishing companies that appear to fall short. Even as headlines proclaim ""greed is back,"" companies are investing time and resources into instituting more ethical practices.

Why is there such dissonance?

As is so often the case these days, businesses are taking cues from millennials. This generation (currently 18-35 years old) represents more than a quarter of the U.S. workforce — and this amount is expected to grow to over 50 percent by 2020. They will account for a third of retail sales in the same year. Businesses not thinking about how to interact with this generation are in serious trouble.

So how do millennials think about corporate social responsibility — or CSR?

A 2014 Nielsen survey showed that millennials are significantly more responsive to CSR in both consumption as well as employment decisions. Of those surveyed who would pay a premium for sustainable products, verify packaging and choose a company with a higher CSR reputation as employer, about half were millennials. These millennials are choosing to spend their resources — be it time or money — on organizations that appear to represent a set of values.

With their significant buying power, millennials are placing huge demands on companies to respond with genuine CSR strategies.

Where can companies start in building out this strategy?

As millennials look for companies that focus on a triple bottom line (people, planet, profit), companies are looking to millennials for guidance. CSR actions should align with a company's values, brand proposition and business model but, at the same time, the company must listen and respond to its constituents.

A key element for any successful CSR strategy is corporate communication. In the early days of CSR, corporations relied heavily on traditional media, delivering their message through advertising. Many did not institutionalize CSR as a separate business activity, relying on the marketing and public relations functions instead. Millennials, however, are far less responsive to press and TV ads and must be engaged differently. In scientific terms, their ""BS meters"" are very finely tuned. As so-called digital natives, this generation looks to social media to both consume and influence information and opinions. Peers are a trusted source; the official company flack is not.

What's more, as opposed to traditional advertising, which is unidirectional, social media is a more delicate instrument where companies receive real-time feedback from their audience. Millennials expect to have their opinions listened and responded to, meaning that companies need to engage in more two-way conversations with their constituents. Establishing a communication strategy that is both consistent and practically nuanced to respond to changes in the environment is a difficult but necessary process for companies to go through.

Overall, millennials are more demanding, more in touch and more skeptical. Brushing these off as cynicism is too simplistic. It puts the onus on organizations to show that they are not simply paying lip service to CSR, as consumers will sniff out and publicize anything that smells of hypocrisy. What's more, it has resulted in companies adapting to — or at least learning valuable lessons about — being more responsible entities.

A recent example is Perdue Farms, one of America's largest poultry companies. In response to the growing demand, particularly from millennials, for cruelty-free meat, Perdue is changing its chicken breeding operations. Working alongside the Humane Society, Perdue has made massive changes to its farming processes, including reducing the use of antibiotics, providing more natural light and changing the way animals are slaughtered. Jim Perdue, chairman of Perdue Farms, has said that increased sales should compensate for the increased costs. He is confident that by going along with what Perdue's customers want, the company will be successful. This way of conducting CSR is a direct response to what consumers saw as a problem.

A proactive approach involves building CSR into the culture of a company, something that many millennials look for as both employees and consumers. This approach can and should also add to the bottom line. Scott Moorehead, CEO of TCC, one of Verizon's largest retailers, said: ""The commoditization of wireless retail stores meant we needed to do more to differentiate ourselves in order to grow a loyal customer and employee base."" With millennials accounting for 85 percent of its workforce, TCC started the Culture of Good program to engage its employees. Among other things, employees are allowed 16 hours per year of paid time off to devote to volunteer efforts. In 2015, the company donated $1.2 million to employee-led charity efforts. Such a policy fits well with two of the major requests from millennials: empowerment and the ability to affect local communities. The company says the result has been higher employee retention and satisfaction, as well as an increase in customers.

TCC and Perdue were successful in different ways in responding to millennials' need for CSR efforts. Both as consumers and as employees, millennials want more from companies. On the company's side, CSR efforts should not be undertaken simply to be the good guys. In keeping faith with investors and creditors, these efforts should be genuinely beneficial to the organization. Not all efforts to implement CSR strategies have been successful in this. American Apparel learned that even the best of intentions in the realm of CSR could be derailed by simple economics.

CSR is arguably at the very core of American Apparel's business model. The company produces its products in the U.S. and offers competitive pay and benefits. Studies of millennials' preference for buying local indicate that such a ""sweatshop-free"" model should be attractive and successful in commanding a premium. Faced with the reality of the world after the Great Recession and stuck with its ethical sourcing strategy, though, American Apparel wasn't able to cut costs as aggressively as competitors did and has failed to make a profit since 2009. The company has also heavily relied on a ""sex sells"" approach to marketing, something that often overshadowed any ethical positioning the company tried to assume.

Other companies have stumbled into unfortunate CSR debacles. Starbucks began a well-intentioned but badly executed social media conversation about race, privilege and gentrification with its #RaceTogether campaign. Volkswagen is reeling from a 40 percent loss in share price and $15 billion in regulatory fines after its public commitment to sustainability was shown to be a cover for some truly bad behavior. The list of companies goes on. But we still argue that attempts at quality CSR are a vital component of a successful business strategy.

Organizations need to appreciate the degree to which the latest generation joining the workforce is making employment and consumption decisions based on CSR efforts. For a CSR strategy to be successful it needs to be authentic, in line with the brand image and attentive to what the public demands.

In the 1970s, Milton Friedman argued strongly — even convincingly — against CSR, considering it a form of taxation exercised on shareholders, consumers or employees by managers who had no legitimacy to do so. This argument relies on the premise that CSR initiatives imply negative net contributions to the bottom line. If we consider, instead, that well-executed CSR strategies lead to customer acquisition, increased sales, employee satisfaction, better teamwork, higher productivity, while lack of CSR can lead to disaster, Friedman's argument fails miserably today. The rise of the millennials as a powerful economic force increasingly exposes the fallacy of Friedman's argument.

The think pieces about the millennials have been written, dissected and rewritten. Although each generation bemoans the faults of the following ones, perhaps it's time we give millennials credit where credit is due: They are forcing business to do good while doing well. Companies need to rise to this challenge quickly or risk becoming an anachronism.

He recently published the first textbook on Corporate Responsibility for the business school market through Sage and is listed as one of the 100 most influential in Business Ethics by the Ethisphere Institute."

Trump Says He Has Regrets, But Too Few To Mention

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ron Galella/WireImage/Getty Images Ron Galella/WireImage/Getty Images

When Donald Trump started a national conversation about his regrets the other day, he notably neglected to say just what he regretted.

""Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that. And believe it or not, I regret it — and I do regret it — particularly where it may have caused personal pain.""

Since Trump read these words from a prepared text in North Carolina, much has been made of his new tone and willingness to soften his message — even though he never actually apologized to anyone or said he was sorry for any particular statement.

Many have seen these few sentences as signaling a new phase in the Trump phenomenon. But they may as easily be heard as a slight variation on the theme Trump has sounded from the beginning. In other words: same song, different verse.

And the song, of course, is the 1969 Frank Sinatra classic ""My Way,"" which sends an unmistakable message of defiance with the dismissive line: ""Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention.""

(Hit play for your soundtrack to the rest of this post):

But more of that in a moment.

Let us first consider the case for the Trump ""personal pain"" remarks being a true change of heart.

Just days before he made those remarks, Trump replaced his controversial campaign boss Paul Manafort, saying on the campaign trail ""when something is broke you fix it."" And one of the two people who took over for Manafort was Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster and strategist well-known for making male conservative candidates more palatable to female moderate voters. (Past clients have included Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich, Fred Thompson and Ted Cruz — not to mention a previous association with Mike Pence.)

Conway has also gotten credit for getting Trump to reach out rhetorically to black voters. His specific argument to them (""What have you got to lose?"") seemed to go over with white audiences, at least, but has not received much love thus far in the African-American community.

In this same pursuit, Trump held a highly publicized meeting over the weekend with his Hispanic advisory group. That left the impression Trump might be backing down from his proposals for a ""deportation force"" to remove everyone now in the U.S. illegally.

But Trump soon said he was not backing down on anything, and his Monday night rally in Akron, Ohio, was animated by talk of a wall from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico — paid for by the government of Mexico.

So these supposed appeals may fall on deaf ears in their supposed target audiences. But no matter. The real intention may be to make Trump less disturbing and divisive in the eyes of voters who might still be persuaded to back him — specifically white independents and moderate Republicans who are not now on board. Many of these are women, and they are Conway's natural habitat.

So is Trump now sending mixed messages, confusing to his core constituency of anti-immigration and anti-trade non-college white men?

Not necessarily. Or at least not any more confusing than the mixed message in Sinatra's ""My Way.""

The uncanny resemblance between Trump's swaggering style and the ""My Way"" ethos has been noted before. Reddit simply ran the full lyrics back in April, the San Diego Tribune suggested in May that the song be Trump's campaign theme, and the Bradenton Herald in Florida in June envisioned Trump singing it himself.

The song, which you have probably heard even if you think you haven't, starts out:

""And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.

""My friend, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.""

Other lines include ""I did it all, and I stood tall,"" and each verse ends with the refrain: ""I did it my way.""

That song has been re-recorded and parodied countless times, by everyone from Elvis Presley to Oscar the Grouch. But it began life as a Sinatra hit in 1969 and became the signature song of the ""Ol' Blue Eyes"" comeback.

The lyrics were the work of pop singer and songwriter Paul Anka, who borrowed the tune from a French ballad of the day. But it was Sinatra who gave the recording its mix of melancholy and machismo, and Anka had him in mind when he wrote it.

In his 2013 autobiography (titled My Way, of course), Anka told of having dinner with Sinatra and ""a couple of mob guys"" and having Sinatra ask about a song Anka had promised him. Anka says he sat up all night at an electric typewriter getting the words down and called Sinatra in the morning.

He also said that when he wrote the lyrics he was trying to reproduce the way Sinatra talked (especially in the song's unlovely phrase ""I ate it up and spit it out"").

Trump himself has also spoken of his experiences with Sinatra in interviews with Howard Stern (warning, the clip contains a curse word):

YouTube

Giving another listen to Sinatra singing ""My Way"" will not clarify all that is uncertain about Trump's stand on immigration — or about the state of the Trump campaign. But it is more entertaining, and possibly more revealing, than all the statements from Trump's myriad surrogates on cable TV news this week."

For such a commonplace bodily function, the sneeze has messed with our minds (and noses) for centuries. It will kill us, it won't kill us. We'll have bad luck, we'll have good luck. Watch out for Satan, he's wily and knows how to get into your nasal membranes. Did you have too much to eat? Are you sad? Do you have a weak heart?

Technically, sneezing is a reflex to the usual irritants such as germs, dust or pollen. But it turns out your nose can get ruffled by some of the strangest things. One false move may trigger an epic sneezing fit, and the 1969 978-day record is ripe for the taking.

Let's look deeper into your nose and all of its mysteries, shall we?

Sneezing is bad for the soul.

In 1515, Leonardo da Vinci dissected a human brain in an effort to find the soul. Though his soulsearching came up empty, this did not stop people from believing that the soul lives inside the head – a concept widely held during that time. When someone sneezed, the soul was believed to have been thrown from the body, thereby leaving it open for invasion by evil spirits.

Sneezing is good for the soul.

The good news is that once invaded, the body would try to quickly force the spirit out; this is best accomplished, of course, by sneezing. No matter which way the spirits are moving, however, sneezes were thought to be a gateway to the supernatural.

If you say ""God Bless You,"" God might spare you. Or not.

The origin of this custom is varied, but one of the more prevalent theories is that during the 6th-century plague, which originated via disease-carrying mice in Egypt, Pope Gregory I urged divine intercession to help ward off illness. Because sneezing was one of the first signs of the deadly plague, he commanded people to say ""God Bless You"" after a sneeze. Even so, by the time the plague had run its course, it had killed half the population of Europe. Pope Gregory may have benefited from a backup plan.

Your heart stops or skips a beat when you sneeze.

It doesn't. However, the increase in pressure in the chest during the sneeze reduces blood flow into the heart from the veins, says Dr. Nancy Sweitzer, chief of cardiology at the University of Arizona's Sarver Heart Center. That leads to a weaker, less forceful beat, which can cause the sensation of a skipped beat.

""The heartbeat is determined by the electrical system of the heart, which is typically on autopilot and just keeps going,"" Sweitzer says. ""The electrical activity of the heart is constant through a sneeze, but the mechanical 'pumping' may be reduced in force, particularly during a forceful sneeze.""

The sneeze: once again proving that feelings are not facts.

Tweezing your eyebrows can make you sneeze.

Weird, but true. Those darn nasal nerves are so capricious. Even something as simple as plucking your eyebrows can irritate the nerve endings in your face, which in turn makes them fire a signal to hassle the nasal nerve. And when you irritate your nasal nerve, it irritates you right back – by making you sneeze.

""The eyebrows and the nose are both innervated by the same branch of the trigeminal nerve, which can be stimulated by tweezing the eyebrows,"" says Dr. Apple Bodemer, an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Wisconsin. ""The neuronal excitation from plucking can travel to the nose — resulting in a sneeze.""

But take heart! You can enlist your eyebrows to fight back. ""Putting pressure on the eyebrow while plucking can short circuit the response and block the sneeze,"" says Bodemer.

Sneezing always comes in threes.

First of all, if you sneeze three times it does not mean that someone is gossiping about you or that you're going to win the lottery. Save that stuff for the playground. Most people sneeze more than once because their first sneeze just didn't pack the punch needed to rid their nasal passages of all irritants. Whether that's three times or 10 times all depends on the power of your nose. The person in the next cubicle who sneezes 15 times in a row has truly wimpy sneezes. Sneezing once is something to brag about, maybe even put on your resume.

Bright light can make you sneeze.

This true phenomenon is called the photic sneeze reflex, and it affects up to 35 percent of the population. This sneeze tends to happen when suddenly moving from dim light to bright light, such as emerging from a movie theater or driving out of a tunnel. The photic sneeze reflex is thought to be genetic, but scientists are still puzzling over this one.

Satiation Brings On Snatiation (What?)

If you were born into a line of snatiators, then your genetically cursed family will have trouble talking over a big meal. That's because they'll be too busy sneezing as a result of their full stomachs. Scientists still don't fully understand the connection, but the neurons activated during digestion are perilously close to the sneezing neurons, and, well, you can glitch. Depending on who comes to Thanksgiving dinner, this can be a good or bad thing.

A study on snatiation found that the sneezing has no relation to what you're eating, and it occurs only when you are so full you can't possibly take another bite. Use this knowledge wisely.

Sneezing is ""catching,"" like a yawn.

It is true that emotions can affect your nasal membranes. Fear makes them shrink (which can make you sneeze), and sadness makes them swell (which can also make you sneeze.) Though there is conflicting evidence, yawning has been linked to empathy, and one study showed that psychopaths — people who lack empathy — may even be immune to contagious yawning.

If sneezing fits are like yawning fits, does that mean that if we are tuned into others' emotions, we might sneeze out of sympathy? Though hard evidence is murky, there is some reason to believe that both yawning and sneezing fits may be powered by the mind, and some sneezing fits have been successfully treated through psychotherapy.

The definitive answer is ""maybe."""

E. T. Mensah, who died 20 years ago, played highlife, an offshoot of jazz that for years was the most popular style of music in southern Africa. Milo Miles reviews a new anthology of Mensah's music.

DAVE DAVIES, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Music critic Milo Miles has a review of a new anthology devoted to the pioneer African bandleader of the '40s and '50s, E. T. Mensah. He was called the King of Highlife, an offshoot of jazz that, for years, was the most popular style of music in southern Africa. Here's Milo's review.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""KWAME NKRUMAH"")

E T MENSAH AND THE TEMPOS: (Singing in foreign language).

MILO MILES, BYLINE: If I told you there was an African bandleader with the touring and organizing skills of a Count Basie, a legacy of spin-off performers as rich as Duke Ellington and a historical influence not unlike Louis Armstrong, and that he even jammed once with Louis Armstrong, you have to ask - who can this be? The answer is E. T. Mensah from Ghana, known as the King of Highlife. The reason Mensah could be so accomplished and yet remain rather obscure in America is because he retired by the 1980s, just as African pop stars began more international tours, eventually even to the United States. Fortunately, Mensah's songs have lost none of their immediate appeal and are properly presented at last in the four-disc set, ""King Of Highlife Anthology,"" which includes everything recorded by Mensah and the various incarnations of his band, the Tempos. A strong example is ""Day By Day.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""DAY BY DAY"")

E T MENSAH AND THE TEMPOS: (Singing) Day by day, night by night, if you born pikin na (ph) girl, you want her to go to school. What a girl she going to be, what a woman to go to school. And she close to come for home, on her way she meets her friend. Now her friend go be na boy, and he take her hand for go.

MILES: Like jazz, highlife is a complex fusion of a number of modes, including jazz itself and African folk forms. There were many other highlife groups even well before Mensah, but none as successful or as sharp. In a move that would shape all subsequent African pop, the Tempos added melodies taken from the Caribbean, Brazil and Latin rhythms, particularly from Cuba, so the anthology includes sprinkled examples of highlife sambas and calypsos. Not all the lyrics are in English, but a surprising number are. Mensah was clearly determined to reach as many audiences as possible without pandering. No matter what the subject, the positive impression delivered by the 69 tracks here remains fun to play, fun to hear, fun to dance to.

(SOUNDBITE OF E. T. MENSAH AND THE TEMPOS SONG, ""JOHN B. CALYPSO"")

MILES: E. T. Mensah also shines as the first postcolonial music superstar of Africa. Taking off with his own band right after World War II, he soon became as popular in Nigeria as he was back in Ghana. He would sometimes assemble a version of the Tempos to keep doing shows back home while he toured. He was also a hit in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, he only played a few shows in Europe in the 1980s, when his music was finally issued there. One standout track included on those initial releases was ""Munsuro.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MUNSURO"")

E T MENSAH AND THE TEMPOS: (Singing in foreign language).

MILES: Mensah died 20 years ago, and ""King Of Highlife Anthology"" finally does him complete justice. The very classy packaging must be praised, including a definitive 60-page condensation of Professor John Collins' biography of Mensah, an essential item for African pop devotees. A couple vocal performances are a bit drab, and the later music is more assured and vivid than the earliest, but those are tiny gripes. For those who want more samples, a batch of Mensah tunes are available on YouTube. Finally, to underscore the influence of Mensah, it's worth noting that superstar Fela Kuti started out running a highlife group, essentially imitating Mensah. The old master was dismissive of Kuti's later Afrobeat. As far as E. T. Mensah was concerned, Fela had stopped following the class act.

DAVIES: Milo Miles reviewed the ""King Of Highlife Anthology"" on the RetroAfric label.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ALL FOR YOU"")

E T MENSAH AND THE TEMPOS: (Singing) All for you, E. T. (ph), all for you. All for you, E. T., all for you. Are they with you, papa? Are they with you, mommy? Are they with you, papa? All for you. All for you, E. T., all for you. All for you, E. T., all for you. All for you, E. T., all for you. All for you, E. T., all for you. Are they with you, papa?

DAVIES: On tomorrow's show, we'll talk with investigative reporter Seth Freed Wessler, who's reported on troubling conditions at privately operated prisons which hold non-citizen federal inmates. The Department of Justice recently announced it would be ending its contracts with the operators. Wessler's series appeared in The Nation. Hope you can join us.

A major study about the best way to treat early-stage breast cancer reveals that ""precision medicine"" doesn't provide unambiguous answers about how to choose the best therapy.

""Precision doesn't mean certainty,"" says David Hunter, a professor of cancer prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

That point is illustrated in a large study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, involving decisions about chemotherapy.

As is true for many cancers, breast cancer responds best to treatment when it is caught early, before it has spread throughout the body. Dr. Fatima Cardoso, the study's lead author and a breast cancer specialist at the Champalimaud Clinical Center in Lisbon, Portugal, says that creates a conundrum for doctors and patients alike.

Because it's the only opportunity to cure the cancer, ""when in doubt we tend to treat"" women with early-stage breast cancer, she told Shots. ""So we know that we overtreat the patients with early breast cancer.""

That means that women could end up undergoing chemotherapy even if it wouldn't really improve their survival odds.

Hoping to refine those treatment decisions, Cardoso helped organize a huge study throughout Europe to see whether a commercially available genetic test called MammaPrint could help reduce that overtreatment. More than 6,600 women participated at 112 institutions in nine nations.

Scientists identified women with breast cancer whose physical exams suggested they were at relatively high risk for having the cancer return eventually after surgery, but who seemed to be at low risk of recurrence based on the genetic test results.

They were invited to participate in the study, which would randomly assign them to have chemotherapy or not. ""You know that chemotherapy is a treatment that scares people, so overall and for the majority of patients, it was not difficult to convince them,"" Cardoso says.

The genomic test, which studies 70 distinct features of a tumor, did a pretty good job of predicting who was at low risk for recurrence of breast cancer and could therefore avoid the pain, discomfort and risks of chemotherapy. (The test, priced at $4,200, is covered by some insurance in the United States.)

The scientists found that 46 percent of women who were deemed to be at high risk of recurrence based on physical symptoms could actually skip chemotherapy with little consequence to their long-term survival.

But the test results weren't always definitive. About 95 percent of women who skipped chemotherapy as a result of the genetic test results were free of metastasis five years later, but those who had the additional treatment did about 1.5 percentage points better, give or take.

""It's possible that the benefit is zero, and it's possible that's 2 percent or maybe even a little more, you can't be sure,"" says Dr. Clifford Hudis, chief executive officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. He was not involved in the European study but co-wrote an editorial accompanying it. It would take another huge clinical trial to figure out whether chemotherapy does in fact add a small survival advantage.

But the study raises a bigger point here: The genomic test, as precise as it is, offers only probabilities, not absolute guidance. And that's a lesson that applies to the whole new realm of precision medicine, which is billed as potentially transformative for medical care.

""The new tools will definitely be helpful, but they often will pose challenges about what the right decision is,"" says Hunter, who wrote a perspective piece noting that people will need to develop a tolerance for uncertainty when using precision medicine tests.

Is it worth all the trouble of chemotherapy for women who are found to be at low risk for recurrence in this genomic test? That's a tough call, because it requires grasping the rather abstract idea of improving survival odds by maybe just 1 percentage point.

""As humans, we're notoriously poor at assessing risk and making those calculations,"" Hunter says.

He says doctors and patients need better tools to understand and communicate the subtleties that are inherent in precision medicine.

Cardoso is already seeing this play out in her clinic. Women shown to be at low genetic risk on the MammaPrint test are usually opting not to have chemotherapy after their surgery. ""But there always [are] some patients for whom 1 percent benefit is enough — and you need to respect the wishes of each individual patient.""

She says the women clearly benefit from the new information, even though it doesn't provide an absolute answer."

A potentially habitable planet about the size of Earth is orbiting the star that is nearest our solar system, according to scientists who describe the find Wednesday in the journal Nature.

The newly discovered planet orbits Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf star that's just 4.25 light-years from Earth — about 25 trillion miles away. The star is too faint to be seen with the naked eye and is close to a much brighter and more famous pair of stars called Alpha Centauri A and B.

Researchers detected the planet by observing how its star wobbled as the planet traveled around it. All that's known about the planet is that it's a bit more massive than Earth and circles its star once every 11 days. Because the star is so dim, temperatures on the planet would be mild enough that any water — if it's there — would be liquid.

""We're talking about a planet that has very similar properties to Earth,"" says Guillem Anglada-Escude of Queen Mary University of London, who led the research team of more than 30 scientists around the world. They have called their campaign to discover this planet Pale Red Dot, after astronomer Carl Sagan's observation that, from other solar systems, Earth would look like a pale blue dot.

Despite some similarities to Earth, if you could stand on this other world, it would still look plenty alien. That's because it is likely that only one side of it ever faces its star.

Looking up from the planet's surface, the star would seem stationary in the sky, says Anglada-Escude, and is so orange that if the planet had an atmosphere like ours, the heavens would perpetually have the color of ""a late autumn sunset.""

Scientists have discovered thousands of planets orbiting distant stars, including a bunch that might be potentially habitable. The proximity of this new planet means scientists will have an easier time doing follow-up studies to learn more about it and even obtain images.

""I'm pretty sure that in the next 10 years, we will know if it has an atmosphere and probably if it has oxygen,"" says Anglada-Escude, who adds that we could even see hints of any life that might be there. He thinks the news that our closest stellar neighbor is orbited by a world that has a shot at possibly supporting life is sure to spur interest in an interstellar mission to pay it a visit.

""It's tantalizing,"" he says. ""Now that we know the planet is there, we can be more creative. We can think about solutions — maybe to send interstellar probes or to design specific spacecraft to look for this planet and only this planet.""

Ofer Cohen of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not part of the research team, says he finds the evidence of the planet's existence convincing. But as to whether it is potentially habitable, ""it's all down to how we define habitability,"" Cohen says.

While the temperatures at the surface might allow for liquid water, he says, ""in reality, nature is much more complicated."" His studies suggest that planets orbiting this type of star need to have a strong magnetic field to protect the atmosphere from being destroyed by the stellar wind.

Edward Guinan, an astronomer at Villanova University, says when he first learned of this new planet a couple of months ago, he seriously doubted that it would have any chance of being habitable. That's because being close to a star means that a planet's atmosphere and any water could get blown away, as the planet is exposed to the stellar wind, flares, X-rays and ultraviolet radiation.

""I was dubious that it could work out to be habitable. My first impression is that it wouldn't be,"" Guinan says. ""And the surprise was, this planet has a chance to have a habitable climate.""

He and a group of colleagues analyzed the possibilities and concluded that there are plausible scenarios that would have left this planet capable of supporting life. So if he were betting, he'd now say there was about a 25 percent chance that it could be a habitable world.

""To have the nearest star with a possibly habitable Earth-sized planet is terrific,"" Guinan says. ""It's wonderful. I'm just really excited.""

And while 4.25 light-years might seem like an impossibly vast distance, that's practically next door in the eyes of astronomers who are used to thinking on a cosmic scale.

""You can get to a tenth of the speed of light with present technology,"" Guinan notes, pointing out that a trip to this planet would take less than half a century.

""And that's not bad,"" he says. ""That's feasible."""

Newborn conjoined twins were evacuated from a Syrian rebel stronghold to the capital, Damascus, after lengthy negotiations earlier this month.

But brothers Moaz and Nawras died early Wednesday before they could be transferred to a hospital outside Syria for urgent heart surgery. It's a tragic end to a story that was the subject of an international campaign to save their lives.

As we reported, the babies, who were joined at the chest, were born in the besieged area of Eastern Ghouta on July 23. Their hearts shared a sac, according to the BBC. The World Health Organization says it took days of negotiations to evacuate them. The hospital in Eastern Ghouta was short of supplies and unable to perform the surgery needed to separate them.

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a press release that Moaz and Nawras died of heart failure. The organization says the pair had been accepted to a hospital in Rome, and ""all formal leave approvals were signed in order to travel.""

Hospitals in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had also offered to treat the twins, as NPR's Allison Meuse reported.

Mona Kurdy, a spokeswoman for the Red Crescent, told The Wall Street Journal that ""approval for the twins to leave Syria was granted Monday, but by then their condition had already started to worsen.""

""There is no one who wasn't cooperative,"" Kurdy said, according to the Journal.

However, Mohamad Katoub, advocacy manager for the Syrian American Medical Society, told the Journal that Syria's Foreign Ministry was responsible for the ultimately fatal delays. The ministry was "" 'looking for a medical solution that matched its political interests' and trying to secure medical treatment for the twins in a country with friendlier relations with Syria,"" he said.

Khatoub tweeted a portrait of the twins by Syrian artist Akram Abo Alfoz:

Nawras and Moaz passed away this early Morning. The whole world couldn't have the permission to evacuate them. pic.twitter.com/3hJvVa6zSj — Mohamad Katoub (@aboali_majed) August 24, 2016

SAMS also said in a statement that the Red Crescent ""kept Moaz and Nawras at a private hospital in Damascus for almost two weeks despite the urgency of the case"" without releasing any information, which it says ""hindered the evacuation process.""

SAMS led the international effort to evacuate the twins, drawing attention to their plight and eliciting a message of support from U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power.

""The tragic death of these two brave souls could have easily been prevented,"" says SAMS President Ahmed Tarakji. ""This is unacceptable."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Christopher Polk/Getty Images Christopher Polk/Getty Images

Take a look at a picture of The Chainsmokers and you'll see everything many people hate about mainstream electronic dance music. Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, the two DJ/producers who go by that name, are two white guys with David Beckham haircuts and perfectly coiffed five o'clock shadows who stick their tongues out while posing in front of the partying throngs their big beats entertain. ""They are frat bros themselves,"" manager Adam Alpert, who assembled the duo via a ""man date"" in 2012, said to Forbes when asked about The Chainsmokers' appeal to young male music fans. They first found live success, in fact, on the frat circuit, playing the kinds of parties where young women do not always feel safe.

Here's a weird thing, though: The singles that have made The Chainsmokers a phenomenally successful recording act don't seem bro-tastic at all. The duo currently has the No. 1 and No. 8 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, ""Closer"" and ""Don't Let Me Down"" respectively, and both feature women's voices not only as key elements, but as the central ruling force. That's very common in dance music and has been since the disco era, when famed songwriters and producers like Paul Jabarra and Giorgio Moroder tapped into the power of African-American soul queens to make their mixes transcendent. Yet, The Chainsmokers' hits are different: They're more conversational, inspired by the intimate strains of indie rock and bedroom electronica. And these songs are not huge party anthems. They're more akin to singer-songwriter confessions, sad and uncertain even when their rhythms build.

Two years ago, few would have expected The Chainsmokers to make this kind of music. The pair's first viral success came through fleshing out a timeworn female stereotype. ""#Selfie"" captures the inner life of a 21st-century ""dumb blonde,"" as this figure was called in the Marilyn Monroe era. This airhead — another era's name for her — shares her molly-addled world view with her friends in the ladies' room as she ponders the status of a potential hookup, throws shade at her fellow clubgoers (""Who wears cheetah?""), and debates what filter to use on the photo she's posting to her Instagram account. She's ridiculous, and so fun to imitate.

The ""#Selfie"" rap critiques millennials' alleged obsession with posing and performing while reflecting a more timeless masculine tendency to treat young women, especially those who try to wield power through beauty, with fond condescension. Some critics identified the song as sexist, although by aiming its barbs at a certain kind of woman, it also gained plenty of female fans. The rap Taggart and Pall wrote isn't really that witty; it's the manic performance by the woman who intones it, Alexis Campisi, that makes ""#Selfie"" irresistible. The Chainsmokers turned to Campisi, then a Baruch College undergraduate with no pop aspirations, because of her knack for satirizing pop frivolity in ways that acknowledge its allure. (Her Britney impression on Vine is hilarious.) When Campisi snaps, ""Let me take a selfie,"" you can feel the whole club turn to photobomb her: This girl might be vain and act scatterbrained, but she is the charismatic center of her scene.

It was after ""#Selfie"" became a Top 40 novelty hit that The Chainsmokers began aiming for a more durably successful sound. Their follow-up, ""Kanye"" was a collaboration with the L.A. dream-pop duo sirenXX that captures the sadness of regular people dazzled by celebrities and disappointed that they can't join their ranks. (The video showed a Latina hotel maid enjoying a Cinderella night, then returning to her daughter and partner in their humble Los Angeles home.) It set a tone. Nearly every subsequent Chainsmokers success features women vocalists whose melancholic observations and confessions offset the busy buzziness of the beat-driven mix. Most are little known; the DJs found them via music blogs or the aggregator Hype Machine. (Let's hope they gain more recognition than did some earlier women whose voices were featured on major dance hits, like Martha Wash, who had to go to court to be recognized.) There's ""Roses,"" a seduction narrative turned off-kilter by the contributions of singer-songwriter Elizabeth Mencel, who calls herself ROZES; the searching ""Inside Out,"" featuring the trilling voice of the Swedish artist Charlee; ""New York City,"" whose singer, Victoria Zaro, has a voice like a teardrop; and ""Don't Let Me Down,"" the closest thing the duo has to a house music-style soul epiphany, with the plaintive stylings of the teenager Daya lifting it aloft.

The most intriguing Chainsmokers song so far is ""Closer,"" a duet between primary lyricist Drew Taggart and the Tumblr-propelled rising star Halsey. A tale of two estranged lovers reuniting for a night in a hotel bar, it unfolds in narrowly cast melodic phrases interwoven with flat, nearly muffled synth lines; a snare drum echoes in the background, as if to get things moving, but the overall effect is quiet and furtive, suiting Taggart's lyrics about intimacies grounded in regret. ""Baby, pull me closer in the back seat of your Rover, that I know you can't afford,"" Taggart moans, and that's the song's hook: This night isn't a triumph for anyone, or even a release. It's just a moment's pleasure. The track intensifies dynamically, but doesn't really climax. Taggart's and Halsey's voices, hesitant and estranged from each other by the slightest Auto-Tune tweaks, unite in a fugitive moment of release, the way an ignored car payment might make a girl feel rich for one self-indulgent weekend. His voice is almost tender; hers is almost sorrowful.

It's unusual for a pop song to occupy this unsettled space, where neither heartbreak nor delight provides genuine emotional release. But it's where people live much of the time, especially when things are uncertain. Building its love story around diminished expectations, ""Closer"" feels hauntingly appropriate for a time when the negatives associated with sex, from the anti-romantic nature of hook-up culture to the prevalence of sexual violence, are in clear view. The encounter the not-so-dumb blonde of ""#Selfie"" contemplates – ""Oh my god, Jason just texted me, should I go home with him?"" — might be the wreckage the heroine of ""Closer"" confronts, her eyes clear this time.

Much of dance-pop right now exists within this melancholy atmosphere, the inverse of the triumphal one occupied by anthemic hits like Sia's ""Cheap Thrills"" or Katy Perry's rising, roaring musical fireworks displays. The voices that define this twilit dance-pop space are feminine. They're different than the wondrous divas of disco and house music, though they do have precursors, like Crystal Waters and the Rickie Lee Jones sample in The Orb's ""Little Fluffy Clouds."" These singers are dreamy and inward-turning, or slightly odd, sharing muttered confidences instead of preaching the gospel. Though most are white, Rihanna, with her Caribbean lilt and cool demeanor, is a ruling spirit. So is Drake, whose ""soft"" rapping style and emotionally intelligent lyrics was, by his own accord, influenced as much by women pioneers at the juncture between hip-hop and R&B, such as Aaliyah and Lauryn Hill, as by male rappers.

Rihanna and Drake established themselves in the age of Auto-Tune and other voice-altering studio tools. These computer programs have changed compositional techniques. For many producers, the human voice has become more of a tonal element than a dominant force, even when it holds a song's central melodic line; building a track, they bend voices, distort them, integrate them as another texture complementing a track's beats and synthesized effects. This happened in earlier dance music movements, too – in his 1979 essay ""In Defense of Disco,"" Richard Dyer wrote of Diana Ross's ""'unreally' sweet, porcelain fragile voice"" as an ideal one for cultivating fantasy and capturing ""the intensity of the passing relationship"" that was key within gay male dance scenes. Today's voices capture a related but different kind of tension, one that's less about cultivating the imagination through chance encounters and more about accepting indeterminacy as a personal status quo.

Rihanna's voice always sounds slightly imperfect, exquisitely ordinary: It's a little flat, a little rough, not perfectly toned and ready to deliver a Produnuva vault like Beyonce's. This is what Halsey's voice is like, too, and the cracks in her phrasing makes her portrayals of millennial anomie more poignant. ""All we do is think about the feelings that we hide,"" she sings in ""Drive,"" one of the outstanding cuts on her debut album, Badlands; the line captures the predicament of young people who feel they're caught between genuine self-expression and fulfilling a series of roles. That's an eternal teenage problem, exacerbated exponentially in the age of avatars. Like her obvious predecessor Lorde, Halsey embodies the weary precociousness of her generation, the kids who've seized technology and built whole new virtual worlds by the time they've hit middle school, but who recognize that their precocious virtual lives don't make their real minds or bodies any less vulnerable. ""I think there's a flaw in my code,"" Halsey intones in ""Gasoline,"" a fan favorite. ""My heart is gold and my hands are cold.""

Perhaps young women's voices best express today's most compelling ambiguities because, after centuries, they're still fighting to control the fate of their own bodies. There's never been more awareness of the struggle women face simply to move freely without being violated, without having their drinks drugged or being assaulted, possibly by people in authority whom they thought they could trust. The EDM scene is notoriously male-dominated and has often proven unsafe for young women. ""We're trying to smoke the beehive,"" one hopped-up ""EDM bro"" told a Vice reporter before venturing into a crowd at last year's Coachella festival, unabashedly announcing his intent to goad women toward his erogenous zones. Dance music critic Philip Sherburne has noted that the imagery and language promoting EDM encourages this ""voyeuristic, objectifying male gaze."" And which artists do these bros love the most? The Chainsmokers, for one. In light of this, it can be hard to tell if male DJs centering their work on women's self-expression is exploitation, compensation or the return of the repressed. It's almost as if the male fantasy conveyed in many dance songs is speaking back and finally telling some truths.

One thing is clear: EDM needs more forthright female energy. In many ways it's following behind other genres. Young women are this summer's story in country and in indie rock. They've dominated the Top 40 for years. Real parity in the DJ booth and the producer's chair is a goal the genre's leaders need to embrace. Organizations like the female:pressure network are fighting for it. It is becoming clear that fans of this music want to hear what women think and feel, and not just about taking selfies."

Trump Says He Has Regrets, But Too Few To Mention

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ron Galella/WireImage/Getty Images Ron Galella/WireImage/Getty Images

When Donald Trump started a national conversation about his regrets the other day, he notably neglected to say just what he regretted.

""Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that. And believe it or not, I regret it — and I do regret it — particularly where it may have caused personal pain.""

Since Trump read these words from a prepared text in North Carolina, much has been made of his new tone and willingness to soften his message — even though he never actually apologized to anyone or said he was sorry for any particular statement.

Many have seen these few sentences as signaling a new phase in the Trump phenomenon. But they may as easily be heard as a slight variation on the theme Trump has sounded from the beginning. In other words: same song, different verse.

And the song, of course, is the 1969 Frank Sinatra classic ""My Way,"" which sends an unmistakable message of defiance with the dismissive line: ""Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention.""

(Hit play for your soundtrack to the rest of this post):

But more of that in a moment.

Let us first consider the case for the Trump ""personal pain"" remarks being a true change of heart.

Just days before he made those remarks, Trump replaced his controversial campaign boss Paul Manafort, saying on the campaign trail ""when something is broke you fix it."" And one of the two people who took over for Manafort was Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster and strategist well-known for making male conservative candidates more palatable to female moderate voters. (Past clients have included Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich, Fred Thompson and Ted Cruz — not to mention a previous association with Mike Pence.)

Conway has also gotten credit for getting Trump to reach out rhetorically to black voters. His specific argument to them (""What have you got to lose?"") seemed to go over with white audiences, at least, but has not received much love thus far in the African-American community.

In this same pursuit, Trump held a highly publicized meeting over the weekend with his Hispanic advisory group. That left the impression Trump might be backing down from his proposals for a ""deportation force"" to remove everyone now in the U.S. illegally.

But Trump soon said he was not backing down on anything, and his Monday night rally in Akron, Ohio, was animated by talk of a wall from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico — paid for by the government of Mexico.

So these supposed appeals may fall on deaf ears in their supposed target audiences. But no matter. The real intention may be to make Trump less disturbing and divisive in the eyes of voters who might still be persuaded to back him — specifically white independents and moderate Republicans who are not now on board. Many of these are women, and they are Conway's natural habitat.

So is Trump now sending mixed messages, confusing to his core constituency of anti-immigration and anti-trade non-college white men?

Not necessarily. Or at least not any more confusing than the mixed message in Sinatra's ""My Way.""

The uncanny resemblance between Trump's swaggering style and the ""My Way"" ethos has been noted before. Reddit simply ran the full lyrics back in April, the San Diego Tribune suggested in May that the song be Trump's campaign theme, and the Bradenton Herald in Florida in June envisioned Trump singing it himself.

The song, which you have probably heard even if you think you haven't, starts out:

""And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain.

""My friend, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.""

Other lines include ""I did it all, and I stood tall,"" and each verse ends with the refrain: ""I did it my way.""

That song has been re-recorded and parodied countless times, by everyone from Elvis Presley to Oscar the Grouch. But it began life as a Sinatra hit in 1969 and became the signature song of the ""Ol' Blue Eyes"" comeback.

The lyrics were the work of pop singer and songwriter Paul Anka, who borrowed the tune from a French ballad of the day. But it was Sinatra who gave the recording its mix of melancholy and machismo, and Anka had him in mind when he wrote it.

In his 2013 autobiography (titled My Way, of course), Anka told of having dinner with Sinatra and ""a couple of mob guys"" and having Sinatra ask about a song Anka had promised him. Anka says he sat up all night at an electric typewriter getting the words down and called Sinatra in the morning.

He also said that when he wrote the lyrics he was trying to reproduce the way Sinatra talked (especially in the song's unlovely phrase ""I ate it up and spit it out"").

Trump himself has also spoken of his experiences with Sinatra in interviews with Howard Stern (warning, the clip contains a curse word):

YouTube

Giving another listen to Sinatra singing ""My Way"" will not clarify all that is uncertain about Trump's stand on immigration — or about the state of the Trump campaign. But it is more entertaining, and possibly more revealing, than all the statements from Trump's myriad surrogates on cable TV news this week."

YouTube

On Mardi Gras morning in New Orleans, if you wake up early enough and head to the Bywater neighborhood — preferably decked out in your most outrageous costume — you're likely to collide with the Krewe of St. Anne as it begins its annual Carnival parade. The society is known for the elaborate, handcrafted, often topical disguises its members don for the broadly inclusive spectacle. (The only criterion for membership, according to the Krewe's website, is ""that you know about it."") By day's end, St. Anne's has made its way down to the riverbank, where paraders who've lost loved ones in the past year scatter the ashes of the departed over the Mississippi's waters. Like a funeral ceremony's second line, the ritual smudges the distinction between mourning and celebration.

""St. Anne's Parade,"" the new single from Americana duo Shovels & Rope's forthcoming album Little Seeds, likewise embraces a glorious muddle of joy and grief — the beauty of life despite the certainty of death. ""Sang out our hearts while they sent away their dead,"" Cary Ann Hearst and Michael Trent sing in compelling harmony, describing the parade's end. ""The sun shone on the river, we began our lives instead.""

Duality isn't unfamiliar subject matter for Hearst and Trent, who are wife and husband as well as musical partners. They've often explored the fine lines between good and evil, sacred and sinful, in songs that function as complex character studies. What's surprising is the open fragility the duo conveys, with their voices sounding ragged over a delicate patchwork of mandolin, sparse piano and touches of reverb-y guitar. It culminates in the song's refrain, sung so it feels like it's breaking from emotion: ""This life may be too good to survive.""

The video for ""St. Anne's Parade"" was directed by The Moving Picture Boys, a.k.a. Jace Freeman and Sean Clark of Nashville, Tenn., who also created a 2014 documentary about Shovels & Rope. Between backlit shots of the duo singing at a vintage microphone, the video depicts an actual Krewe of St. Anne foot parade in which Trent, Hearst and friends, adorned with glittering Mardi Gras beads, are participants. ""Friends of ours had a 'The Owl And The Pussycat'-themed wedding party that marched with St. Anne's,"" Hearst and Trent tell NPR via email. ""They took their vows on the riverbank while the sun shone down on a previously rainy morning. Everyone was feeling sweet and love was all around.""

Little Seeds is out Oct. 7 via New West."

Donald Trump has been changing his tone toward African-Americans and Latinos in recent days. He's been speaking in mostly white communities, but on Wednesday he'll speak in mostly black Jackson, Miss.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

We're going to sort through some new developments in the presidential campaign. In a moment, we'll look at how the Clinton Foundation is planning to scale back if Hillary Clinton wins the election. The head of the foundation laid out those plans to NPR late yesterday.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

There have also been questions about whether Donald Trump is scaling back his plans on immigration. NPR's Sarah McCammon is following that. She's on the line with us from Jackson, Miss., where Donald Trump will campaign later today. Good morning.

SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee.

MONTAGNE: So last weekend, Donald Trump met with a roundtable of Hispanic leaders. Since then, we've heard a number of different things about where Trump is heading on immigration. What do you know, say, as of this morning?

MCCAMMON: Well, it's kind of been the mystery of the week with the Trump campaign. There had been indications that Trump was ready to soften his call for a deportation force to remove people in the country illegally.

His running mate, Mike Pence, said yesterday that would be sorted out in the next couple of days. And then Trump was asked about this in a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity last night. Here's what he had to say.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""HANNITY"")

DONALD TRUMP: There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people. We have some great people in this country. We have some great, great people in this country.

(APPLAUSE)

TRUMP: So - but we're going to follow the laws of this country.

MCCAMMON: And that sounds similar to the position of many Republicans and, frankly, of President Obama, who has stepped up deportations, compared to the Bush administration. Trump's campaign manager seemed to praise President Obama for that in an interview yesterday, while arguing Hillary Clinton will be weak on immigration.

MONTAGNE: But isn't there some risk that Donald Trump could alienate his base if he does, as he says, soften his position on immigration?

MCCAMMON: Right. Remember, this is the issue that has fired up so many Trump supporters from the very beginning...

MONTAGNE: Oh, yeah.

MCCAMMON: ...Fueled his campaign. At a rally last night in Texas, it sounded like some of the same old Donald Trump. He appeared with parents whose children were killed by people in the country illegally.

The crowd broke into chants of build the wall. You know, so the base is pretty locked in on this issue. But Trump has to expand beyond that if he wants to win the general election. Polls are making it clear.

Over the last month or so, he's been slipping several points behind Hillary Clinton. So there seems to be a tension here between whether Trump can pivot to expand his appeal to more moderate Republican voters, to minorities - and at the same time, just let Trump be Trump.

MONTAGNE: Right. But Trump has also been making what seems to be an appeal to African-American voters in recent days. He's speaking tonight in Jackson, Miss., as we said, which is predominantly an African-American city. You're there. What do you expect to hear?

MCCAMMON: So for months, Trump has said that he will do well with black voters, although he is registering in the low single digits in polls right now. And so in several recent speeches, he's been giving a pretty bleak portrayal of what life is like in black communities. Here's what he said this week in Akron, Ohio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: Poverty, rejection, horrible education, no housing, no homes, no ownership, crime at levels that nobody's seen - you can go to war zones in countries that we're fighting. And it's safer that living in some of our inner cities. They're run by the Democrats.

MCCAMMON: And Renee, I've spent the past day here in Jackson, Miss. African-Americans here have told me that's not their experience of their community. And, you know, you hear Trump's pitch arguing that Democrats have failed African-Americans. But it's not clear it's resonating so far.

MONTAGNE: Yeah. Well, the people you've talked to - what are they saying?

MCCAMMON: You know, I'm not meeting a lot of fans of Donald Trump. I've heard what he says is demeaning - that he's talking down to African-Americans by making these broad-brush statements about how terrible things are.

A lot of people here have their views of Donald Trump pretty well-set. So all of this may not help Trump much with African-American voters, Renee, but it could help him with a key slice of white voters - those being suburban women.

They tend to be swing voters - often, really key for Republicans. And if they hear Trump talking about African-American issues and feel like some of the racial overtones may be softening on his campaign, that could help Trump.

MONTAGNE: NPR's Sarah McCammon speaking to us from Jackson, Miss., where Donald Trump will campaign tonight - thanks, Sarah.

MCCAMMON: Thank you.

A U.S. security regulator has approved state-owned China National Chemical Corp's planned $43 billion takeover of Swiss company Syngenta. The deal was held up while the U.S. reviewed its impact.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

We may be about to see the largest-ever foreign acquisition by a Chinese company. The state-owned China National Chemical Corporation is trying to take over Swiss seed giant Syngenta. The deal was held up while the U.S. scrutinized its impact on the American food supply chain. But now the U.S. has cleared the way. NPR's Jackie Northam reports.

JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: The planned takeover bid of Syngenta by ChemChina is worth $43 billion. If it goes through, it could make the Chinese company a major player worldwide in pesticides and genetically modified seeds. It could also help China provide food security for its growing population.

Even though Syngenta is a Swiss company, it does about a quarter of its business here in the U.S. And the sale was held up because the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. wanted to see if it presented a threat to national security.

ANNE SALLADIN: I think they'd be examining whether or not what they produce here is something that is of importance to the U.S. government.

NORTHAM: Anne Salladin is a Washington lawyer who used to work on Foreign Investment reviews when she was with the Treasury Department. She says she wouldn't be surprised if the committee focused on what impact the Chinese takeover of Syngenta would have on U.S. food security.

SALLADIN: Whether or not there is particular technology that is of strategic interest to the United States government that could be useful, for example, in some sort of a food emergency.

NORTHAM: The government has the power to prevent the company from doing business in the U.S. The ChemChina deal provoked widespread concern among many farmers and members of Congress who said it could give Beijing a foothold on America's agricultural infrastructure and could prompt more similar deals.

Harry Clark is a lawyer who advises companies on the Foreign Investment reviews. He says he expects more national security reviews in the future as mergers and acquisitions heat up.

HARRY CLARK: I do. The levels of international investment in the United States, particularly from China, have been growing.

NORTHAM: The U.S. may have approved the takeover bid. But now ChemChina has to get past European regulators. Jackie Northam, NPR News, Washington.

In Maine's North Woods, forests and rivers that used to feed paper mills will now be permanently protected as a national monument — thanks to a donation by the co-founder of Burt's Bees.

President Obama announced the creation of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument on Wednesday, just one day before the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service.

The designation of the woods as protected territory has been in the works for years — and has been controversial among locals, who worried about federal oversight of lands that used to be central to the regional economy.

Pros And Cons Of Proposed Maine Woods National Park Listen · 3:50 3:50

The new monument encompasses some 87,500 acres of ""awe-inspiring mountains, forests and waters,"" as the White House puts it. The land ""is rich in biodiversity and known for its outstanding opportunities to hike, canoe, hunt, fish, snowmobile, snowshoe and cross-country ski,"" the administration notes.

Susan Sharon of Maine Public Radio put it a little more poetically earlier this year:

""The heart of the North Woods, about 3.5 million acres, remains the largest undeveloped territory east of the Rockies. This is the same continuousness of forest that captivated naturalist Henry David Thoreau 150 years ago. Still mostly uninhabited, it's a place that crawled with rugged lumberjacks armed with heavy axes, where logs by the millions were floated downriver to mill towns that sprung up out of the woods themselves.""

The monument, which will be managed by the National Park Service, will allow those recreational activities while also protecting natural resources.

It was established with a donation of land and tens of millions of dollars, all from Roxanne Quimby.

Along with Burt Shavitz, she founded a company widely known for its lip balms and other personal care products, as we reported last year:

""Burt's Bees began in 1984 when Shavitz met an artist named Roxanne Quimby. According to the company's website, Quimby 'was thumbing a ride home (back when you could still do that sort of thing). Eventually a bright yellow Datsun pickup truck pulled over, and Roxanne instantly recognized Burt Shavitz, a local fella whose beard was almost as well-known as his roadside honey stand. Burt and Roxanne hit it off, and before long, Roxanne was making candles with unused wax from Burt's beehives. They made $200 at their first craft fair; within a year, they'd make $20,000.' ""The company grew and moved its headquarters to Durham, N.C., in 1993. But Shavitz's partnership with Quimby unraveled in the late '90s. The Daily Beast, citing Shavitz and a documentary titled Burt's Buzz, says the two reached a settlement after Quimby found out Burt had an affair with a college-age girl who worked at one of the Burt's Bees stores. ""Quimby eventually bought out Shavitz. Burt's Bees is now owned by the Clorox Co.""

Burt's Bees made Quimby wealthy, and she used her fortune to buy large quantities of former timber land in northern Maine.

But her plans to protect the landscape weren't welcomed by all local residents, as Susan Sharon reported for NPR in 2011:

""For generations, Maine's North Woods have provided pulp for the state's paper mills and created plenty of good jobs in an area with little other economic activity. But now the paper industry is struggling and a mill job is no longer a guarantee. ... ""Quimby used her newfound fortune to buy up land in Maine's North Woods from downsizing paper companies. Some local residents see her as a villain for closing off her land to hunting and snowmobiling — activities the paper companies have long allowed — and for taking it out of timber production.""

There were fierce debates over the merits of giving the land to the National Park Service — some saw it as a source of tourist income for the region, others as federal oversight.

Opposition continued up until the declaration of the monument on Wednesday.

""Some locals, including Maine's timber industry, and the Sportsman's Alliance object to federal control of the land, and Maine's congressional delegation refused to back legislation to make the area a national park,"" NPR's Scott Horsley reports.

""President Obama instead used his executive authority to create the monument,"" Scott says. ""The White House notes that Maine's popular Acadia National Park was created in a similar fashion, a century ago."""

A powerful earthquake shook central Italy overnight, killing at least 150 people, according to Italy's prime minister, and destroying large swaths of several towns. Victims are still being pulled from the rubble, and the full extent of the devastation is not yet clear.

The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the quake, which was centered about 100 miles northeast of Rome, had a magnitude of 6.2 and was shallow — at a depth of just over 6 miles.

Amatrice, Accumoli, Arquata del and Pescara del Tronto, in the Apennine mountains, are among the hardest-hit towns. They're small in size but popular as tourist destinations — and August is a prime time for vacations in the area.

""A lot of the officials are lamenting that these are tiny towns but their populations swell in the summer, specifically because they are very sought-after vacation getaways,"" Associated Press reporter Nicole Winfield told NPR.

""So the tiny town of Accumoli ... the mayor said is only a population of 700 but it swells to about 2,500 in the summer,"" she says, raising concerns about high casualty numbers.

The towns in the region are old, with roots in medieval Italy, and some have been ""completely razed,"" Winfield says: ""The buildings are old and they just crumbled.""

Some buildings in the area feature architecture dating to the 16th century, according to the website for the city of Amatrice.

The earthquake struck just after 3:30 a.m. local time on Wednesday morning, Christopher Livesay reports for NPR.

""One of the towns worst hit is Amatrice,"" Livesay reports. ""The mayor says half the town 'doesn't exist' anymore, and that all roads to and from have been cut off.""

""Thousands of rescue workers are scrambling to save survivors,"" Livesay reported from Amatrice.

Reports collected by the USGS show that the impact of the quake was felt from coast to coast in central Italy and as far north as Bologna and as far south as Naples.

Emma Tucker, the deputy editor of The Times of London, was one of the thousands of people on vacation in the region struck by the earthquake.

She was staying at a farmhouse just over 50 miles from the epicenter of the quake, and woke up to ""very intense"" shaking.

""The thing that I keep remembering was this terrible noise. ... It sounded like a train was heading towards the house and was going to run over it, sort of a thunderous clanking noise,"" she tells NPR. ""I'm told this was short [for an earthquake], it was 20 seconds, but they felt very, very long, those 20 seconds.""

Hundreds of people have been injured in the earthquake, and thousands of people need temporary housing, The Associated Press says, citing Italy's civil protection agency.

According to local media reports, in Accumoli alone, the mayor says there are some 1,500 people now homeless, NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports.

TV images show survivors wearing the slippers and pajamas they fled in overnight; it will be chilly when night arrives in the mountains, Sylvia says.

Rescue crews have struggled to access some of the quake-damaged communities; roads are impassable in some regions. Pope Francis has dispatched Vatican firefighters to assist in the effort, Sylvia reports.

The Associated Press reports that in Amatrice, the air was choked with dust and thick with the smell of gas:

""Rocks and metal tumbled onto the streets, and dazed residents huddled in piazzas as some 39 aftershocks jolted the region into the early morning hours, some as strong as 5.1. "" 'The whole ceiling fell but did not hit me,' marveled resident Maria Gianni. 'I just managed to put a pillow on my head and I wasn't hit luckily, just slightly injured my leg.' ""Another woman, sitting in front of her destroyed home with a blanket over her shoulders, said she didn't know what had become of her loved ones. "" 'It was one of the most beautiful towns of Italy and now there's nothing left,' she said, too distraught to give her name. 'I don't know what we'll do.' ""As daylight dawned, residents, civil protection workers and even priests began digging out with shovels, bulldozers and their bare hands, trying to reach survivors.""

The Apennines are ""tectonically and geologically complex,"" the USGS writes, and the region has experienced several major earthquakes.

In 2009, a major earthquake hit near the city of L'Aquila, not far from Wednesday's quake.

The 2009 earthquake killed 300 people. Afterward, seismologists were convicted of manslaughter for having said, days before the quake, that it was improbable a large quake was imminent. Their statement was in response to a widely publicized earthquake prediction by a layperson.

The convictions, which were criticized by scientists who said there is simply no reliable way to predict earthquakes, were later overturned."

They call it the octobot.

The squishy eight-legged robot described in the journal Nature is made entirely out of soft, flexible materials, runs on hydrogen peroxide, and looks like a 2-centimeter-tall baby octopus.

It is a step forward for robotics, which has long relied on machines with hard skeletons (think The Terminator), or at least with rigid moving parts (like this other octopus-like guy designed by the Italian robot scientist Cecilia Laschi).

In their paper, the authors say the systems behind their invention, which you can watch move in the video below, ""may serve as a foundation for a new generation of completely soft, autonomous robots.""

YouTube

Here are the basic steps to build a squishy robot that runs on a household disinfectant.

First, build the robot brain. In this case, the logical engine of the machine looks like a flexible silicone wafer about a millimeter thick. On top of the wafer are a series of microscopic fluid channels connected into a circuit, kind of like a computer circuit board that controls liquid instead of electricity.

Next, the brain needs a body. The robot engineers took the wafer brain and put it into a mold shaped like a little octopus, which is the animal that inspired the design. Then they used 3-D printing and lithography to lay down multiple squishy materials that became the body and legs of the robot. On the top side of the legs, the material is very elastic, which allows the legs to curl up.

Lastly, the body needs fuel. The octobot runs on a 50 percent hydrogen peroxide solution, which is much stronger than the consumer product; the over-the-counter concentration is usually less than 5 percent. The peroxide fuel goes into two tiny reservoirs in the body of the robot, where it flows into the channels of the ""brain."" As it reacts with platinum in the walls of the channels, the fluid breaks down into water and oxygen gases.

This video shows what the chemical reaction looks like when two different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide break down into gases.

YouTube

The gases take up about 160 times more space than the liquid fuel did, and as they move through the channels and out into the legs, the legs bend to accommodate the gas. Right now, the octobot can flex and unflex its legs for for four to 8 minutes on 1 milliliter of fuel.

And that's it: the robot isn't designed to do anything in particular. It's an early proof-of-concept design. But future soft robots could squeeze into tight spaces or gently touch humans.

Barry Trimmer, a roboticist at Tufts University and the editor-in-chief of the journal Soft Robotics, writes in an email to NPR, ""Soft robots and soft material technologies are definitely needed if we expect to deploy autonomous machines in the home or in natural environments. They have the potential to be more robust, safe and biocompatible than current robots.""

He says although the octobot may not appear to do much, he is impressed by how the research team uses fluids to power it, and excited about what their technique could mean for future autonomous robots.

""This is an ingenious approach to building and controlling a completely soft robot,"" he writes. ""The octobot is an inspiration for those of us trying to make better and safer robots."""

A major study about the best way to treat early-stage breast cancer reveals that ""precision medicine"" doesn't provide unambiguous answers about how to choose the best therapy.

""Precision doesn't mean certainty,"" says David Hunter, a professor of cancer prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

That point is illustrated in a large study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, involving decisions about chemotherapy.

As is true for many cancers, breast cancer responds best to treatment when it is caught early, before it has spread throughout the body. Dr. Fatima Cardoso, the study's lead author and a breast cancer specialist at the Champalimaud Clinical Center in Lisbon, Portugal, says that creates a conundrum for doctors and patients alike.

Because it's the only opportunity to cure the cancer, ""when in doubt we tend to treat"" women with early-stage breast cancer, she told Shots. ""So we know that we overtreat the patients with early breast cancer.""

That means that women could end up undergoing chemotherapy even if it wouldn't really improve their survival odds.

Hoping to refine those treatment decisions, Cardoso helped organize a huge study throughout Europe to see whether a commercially available genetic test called MammaPrint could help reduce that overtreatment. More than 6,600 women participated at 112 institutions in nine nations.

Scientists identified women with breast cancer whose physical exams suggested they were at relatively high risk for having the cancer return eventually after surgery, but who seemed to be at low risk of recurrence based on the genetic test results.

They were invited to participate in the study, which would randomly assign them to have chemotherapy or not. ""You know that chemotherapy is a treatment that scares people, so overall and for the majority of patients, it was not difficult to convince them,"" Cardoso says.

The genomic test, which studies 70 distinct features of a tumor, did a pretty good job of predicting who was at low risk for recurrence of breast cancer and could therefore avoid the pain, discomfort and risks of chemotherapy. (The test, priced at $4,200, is covered by some insurance in the United States.)

The scientists found that 46 percent of women who were deemed to be at high risk of recurrence based on physical symptoms could actually skip chemotherapy with little consequence to their long-term survival.

But the test results weren't always definitive. About 95 percent of women who skipped chemotherapy as a result of the genetic test results were free of metastasis five years later, but those who had the additional treatment did about 1.5 percentage points better, give or take.

""It's possible that the benefit is zero, and it's possible that's 2 percent or maybe even a little more, you can't be sure,"" says Dr. Clifford Hudis, chief executive officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. He was not involved in the European study but co-wrote an editorial accompanying it. It would take another huge clinical trial to figure out whether chemotherapy does in fact add a small survival advantage.

But the study raises a bigger point here: The genomic test, as precise as it is, offers only probabilities, not absolute guidance. And that's a lesson that applies to the whole new realm of precision medicine, which is billed as potentially transformative for medical care.

""The new tools will definitely be helpful, but they often will pose challenges about what the right decision is,"" says Hunter, who wrote a perspective piece noting that people will need to develop a tolerance for uncertainty when using precision medicine tests.

Is it worth all the trouble of chemotherapy for women who are found to be at low risk for recurrence in this genomic test? That's a tough call, because it requires grasping the rather abstract idea of improving survival odds by maybe just 1 percentage point.

""As humans, we're notoriously poor at assessing risk and making those calculations,"" Hunter says.

He says doctors and patients need better tools to understand and communicate the subtleties that are inherent in precision medicine.

Cardoso is already seeing this play out in her clinic. Women shown to be at low genetic risk on the MammaPrint test are usually opting not to have chemotherapy after their surgery. ""But there always [are] some patients for whom 1 percent benefit is enough — and you need to respect the wishes of each individual patient.""

She says the women clearly benefit from the new information, even though it doesn't provide an absolute answer."

Bernie Sanders is launching a new political organization. It's called Our Revolution. It aims to support candidates and, according to its website, ""advance the progressive agenda that we believe in.""

But the revolution is getting off to a rocky start.

Eight key staffers abruptly resigned over the weekend in a dispute over the group's leadership and legal structure.

Sanders himself is set to address followers on Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET for the launch of the group. You can watch that here:

YouTube

Among the departures was the group's organizing director, Claire Sandberg, who also worked on the Sanders presidential campaign. Sandberg is critical of Our Revolution's director, former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, for structuring the group as a 501(c)(4) (the section of the IRS code for a ""social welfare"" organization).

Sandberg charges that Weaver did that so ""he could take big checks from billionaires.""

But the 501(c)(4) status also means the group can't contribute directly to candidates many Sanders backers support, such as Tim Canova, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary against former Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The incumbent has been a target of Sanders supporters, who charge she improperly backed Hillary Clinton for the nomination.

Allowing unlimited contributions from anonymous groups is also the polar opposite of the presidential campaign, in which Sanders rarely failed to point out his average contribution was $27.

But Weaver says there is a difference between a presidential campaign and a group like Our Revolution. In a presidential race, he said, ""You don't want somebody elected, who is beholden to wealthy individuals or interests.""

But in the case of a nonprofit like Our Revolution, Weaver added, ""I have nothing to offer people in return for their support"" other than pushing forward the progressive goals and agenda that those who supported Sanders share.

There is another reason for the walkout at Our Revolution: Weaver himself.

Sanders supporters like Sandberg blame Weaver for Sanders' coming up short in his quest for the nomination. She said bluntly that those who worked on the campaign ""saw that his failed leadership is what cost Bernie the nomination.""

Weaver shrugs off the criticism, saying he, too, was disappointed by the outcome, and that ""if it's cathartic for people to sort of make me the lightning rod for their upset about not having won, I'm certainly willing to play that role for them.""

What's unclear is what role the Vermont senator will have in Our Revolution. As a federal officeholder, Sanders faces limits on the kind of fundraising he can do for other candidates.

Weaver said Our Revolution aims to tap into the enthusiasm that led to Sanders' winning 23 primaries and caucuses, by supporting candidates for down-ballot races and working to train future candidates to create, as he put it, ""a progressive bench."""

Warning: This post discusses the basic plot elements of the Netflix series Stranger Things, the comic Paper Girls, and the film Super 8.

Autumn 1979. Ohio. Five kids on bikes tool around their suburban development and stumble into an adventure involving monsters and sinister authority figures.

Autumn 1983. Indiana. Four kids on bikes tool around their suburban development and stumble into an adventure involving monsters and sinister authority figures.

Autumn 1988. Ohio. Four kids on bikes tool around their suburban development and stumble into an adventure involving monsters and sinister authority figures.

These are the setups of three recent pop culture offerings: respectively, the 2011 film Super 8, the new Netflix series Stranger Things, and the Image Comics series Paper Girls, which launched last year.

But these three properties share a lot more than just that common jumping-off point. They are all concerned with adolescence, specifically the push-pull tension between the familiar safety of home and the unknown dangers of the adult world.

That's a well-trodden patch of pop-cultural real estate, of course, and much has already been written about how much Stranger Things in particular owes to both Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. Certainly ""E.T. meets IT"" makes for a tidy logline, but there's a good deal more to the show, and to the whole ""Kids on Bikes"" science fiction subgenre to which it belongs.

There's plenty of Ray Bradbury and Madeleine L'Engle in the mix, for example; books like The October Country and A Wrinkle in Time helped create the ""Kids on Bikes"" sci-fi subgenre, in which smart kids realize otherworldly dangers adults refuse to see. But then, that's something we've been chewing over ever since Aesop wrote about the perils involved in the protocol of using a kid as your village's early-warning wolf-defense system.

Even so: in 1982, Spielberg's E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial cemented several of the core tenets of the ""Kids on Bikes"" subgenre, and those elements are central to all three of these recent properties, in different ways.

1. The Bikes

They're hugely important — arguably moreso than the kids who ride them — because they're a perfect distillation of what this subgenre's all about: the first taste of freedom, and the dangers that come with it.

Bikes allow kids a limited form of autonomy — they can roam freely, but not terribly far. They are powered by a kid's own muscle and determination, not anything external. They are nearly silent, perfect for stealthy midnight excursions beyond one's own quiet cul-de-sac.

In Super 8 and Stranger Things, the bikes allow the kids to slip between the cracks and explore on their own, beyond adult attention. So important are they to this form of storytelling that the discovery of one kid's abandoned bike is the trigger that first alerts Stranger Things' sheriff that something isn't right.

In Paper Girls, the Image comic written by Brian K. Vaughan and illustrated by Cliff Chiang, the bikes are the main characters' tools of the trade. They're the means by which they go about their business — distributing morning newspapers — and the reason they're up before dawn to encounter three hooded figures who, it seems, are up to no earthly good.

2. The Time

1979, 1983, 1988. This is science fiction not powered by a vision of the future but a longing for the past. Specifically, the past of its creators' childhoods — the era when they first saw ET, and its basic visual and plot beats imprinted themselves onto their minds. Super 8 can't help leaning into the Spielbergian tendency to cast childhood in a golden, nostalgic glow, while the darker Stranger Things seems more willing to engage with things like bullying and other forms of petty, everyday middle-school persecution.

Paper Girls is the only one of the three to tell its story from the point of view of young women, not boys, and it doesn't seem coincidental that its tone is harder, flintier, funnier, more pragmatic, and far less concerned with idealizing the ""lost innocence"" of childhood.

All three are set in autumn, a season of transition from carefree leisure to a colder, harsher, colorless existence. Halloween figures as a plot point in Paper Girls — a time when the veils between our world and the next wears thin.

3. The Place

Midwestern suburbia. Or at least, Midwestern suburbia as it's collectively remembered, full of culverts, storm drains, empty lots, and deep woods, where well-maintained split-level colonials lie just blocks away from more modest trailer homes.

As storytelling triggers go, ""There's something dark lurking behind the white picket fences"" has been used so often it's lost any real power to surprise, which is why all three of these properties are careful to depict their suburban settings as less than idyllic. Which brings us to:

4. The Adults

In all three, parents and other adults tend to struggle to get by. Single-parent homes are the norm, often touched by addiction of one sort or another. In Super 8, the main character's father seethes with resentment over the death of his wife. In Paper Girls, one character's stepmother threatens suicide in front of her, and on Stranger Things, every adult seems lost: the sheriff to grief and booze and pills, the missing boy's mother to what everyone around her believes to be mental illness.

Their existence in these stories serves to isolate and define our young main characters. To our kid protagonists, adults are too wrapped up in themselves to pay attention, much less take necessary action. They cannot be convinced, so they must be circumvented — that's the story engine that drives every ""Kids on Bikes"" tale.

(Note: In recent issues, Paper Girls has featured one adult who's completely sympathetic, and in whom the characters completely trust, though exactly why they do so is something I shouldn't reveal here.)

... (But it's pretty cool.)

5. The Authority Figures

Sinister, faceless, possessed of advanced technology and — most importantly — not to be trusted. In all three, they represent Adulthood in its final form, furthest away from the high emotionalism of Childhood — coldly and ruthlessly scientific. Both Super 8 and Stranger Things double down on their ET influences with hazmat suits that could have been lifted from that films prop department. Paper Girls, on the other hand, tweaks the formula in ways that have yet to be fully revealed - but again, cold science seems to be the enemy of feeling, of the human connections our characters so prize.

6. The Monster(s)

Inevitably, unfailingly, the least interesting or engaging thing about the ""Kids on Bikes"" subgenre. Maybe this is because, on any story's metaphorical level, it always represents the same thing — the fear of growing up — and thus can never be satisfyingly defeated by our heroes, only grudgingly accepted.

Super 8 hammers all of this home with some broadly telegraphed business involving a locket, while Stranger Things wisely backgrounds its monster as long as it can, because it and we are far more interested in its all-too-human monster, played by Matthew Modine. It's still too early in Paper Girls' run to know for certain what it's up to, but it also seems wisely determined to keep our eyes on its human villains.

All six of these core elements owe a lot to Spielberg and King, but they've since become a part of our collective narrative infrastructure. The storytellers who've come after them will keep finding ways to pay them homage while altering the precise alchemical mix in ways that make what they create from them new, and wholly distinct.

(NOTE: But you know those scenes in Stranger Things where Eleven is walking through that vast dark space, across water? That's an example of the show borrowing from something much more recent and less well-known — in this case, Jonathan Glazer's creepy, atmospheric 2013 indie Under The Skin — and that, to me, seems much less a valid homage, and much closer to mere imitation.)"

In the small flood-ravaged town of Springfield, La., Rachel Moriarity waited more than a week for a center where she could apply for emergency food stamps to finally open in the Am-Vets hall — but she's been turned away at the door.

This week they are processing only those with last names beginning with A through D.

""I don't have a vehicle to get here,"" she tells a staffer from the state, who replies that due to the volume of applicants in need, there isn't anything they can do.

A defeated and exhausted Moriarity sits down on one of the metal folding chairs anyway. She doesn't know if she can hold out until next week for food.

""We don't have it; it's just not there anymore,"" she says.

At least her husband is back to work, she says. He missed the last five days. They lost both their cars in the flood. She has a FEMA voucher for a rental. But she's been told there are no cars available for at least three weeks, and anyway the nearest place to rent one is in Alabama.

""It really is hard, I mean, you look at your neighbors and you look at all the stuff that's on the street and you don't even want to go outside,"" she says. ""But then you can't stay inside all the time, so the depression levels are really high.""

Moriarity's crisis is far from unique. In Louisiana, more than 115,000 people have now applied for aid, and at least as many homes and businesses are ruined or badly damaged. Authorities expect the numbers to keep climbing.

Along a 100-mile route across the southern part of the state, the sheer scope of loss can be overwhelming.

The narrow country highways that fan out from Springfield are lined with piles of couches and furniture ruined by floodwater. Debris from gutted mobile homes is piled at the ends of dirt driveways. On one road, a handmade sign next to some abandoned cars reads ""you loot, we shoot.""

About 45 miles to the northwest of Springfield, Al McGee races to get his home cleaned out and all the Sheetrock removed, before the mold takes over.

""We're tearing all the walls out, we've gotta dry it all out to the brick,"" he says, with fans humming in what used to be his kitchen.

McGee is 79. He's wearing a back brace. He and his wife are on a fixed income, now living with relatives. He chokes back tears when he says he doesn't know what he'd do if his son-in-law wasn't driving up here every day from New Orleans to clean and rebuild.

""He's been more than good to me,"" McGee says. ""It means the world to me.""

McGee is not expecting much help from his insurance company or the government. Like most folks in this rural neighborhood outside Baton Rouge, he has no flood insurance. Until the storm that dumped nearly two feet of water beginning Aug. 11, not a drop of water had ever entered the house in the 45 years he's lived here.

""Everything is just miserable,"" he says, ""and then having to live in somebody else's house and you don't know where anything is.""

One of the biggest problems right now is finding enough workers to gut all these homes and haul away all the debris. Now that the floodwater has receded, sanitation workers are resuming pickups, but the scope of the work is staggering. More than 50,000 homes in East Baton Rouge Parish alone are said to be affected.

And then there are the places farther to the west along Interstate 10 that are still inundated by floodwater after almost two weeks.

In Lafayette, George Alexander puts on a pair of rubber boots and wades through mucky, fouled water to check on his elderly neighbor's mobile home for the first time since they evacuated. He is surprised to find only a little bit of water damage inside. The same can't be said for his own house next door where he's lived since 1959.

""If you go in there, everything's floating,"" Alexander says.

The water is still chest high. Alexander says mildew has set in and everything inside is buckling. He's doubtful he'll get to move back.

But he knows he's luckier than some of his neighbors — he has flood insurance. And right now he's staying with his daughter. Hundreds more people around here are still living in shelters."

It has been three years since The Office wrapped, and actor John Krasinski, who played Jim Halpert, is still feeling lucky. Landing a role on the NBC comedy series had been an unfathomably big break for the actor, whose previous work had been in a series of commercials and off-Broadway plays.

""I take stock of the fact every single day that I'm living a lottery-ticket life,"" he tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. ""It's so unbelievably rare to get the opportunity that I did to be on The Office, so what I try to do instead is try to deserve to stay here. That's why I branched out to do writing and directing and producing.""

Krasinski's latest project is directing and co-starring in the new film The Hollars. He plays a man who returns home when his mother, played by Margo Martindale, is hospitalized with a brain tumor.

Krasinski says that Martindale's role as the family matriarch was crucial to the film's creation. ""This part is the centerpiece of the movie, and Margo is the centerpiece of the cast,"" he says. ""As soon as she signed on, I knew we had something special.""

Interview Highlights

On directing veteran actors Margo Martindale and Richard Jenkins in The Hollars

Everybody in this cast was so good. I actually remember actually asking Matt Damon about his experience with Clint Eastwood, and he told me this story about how it was so terrifying working with Clint Eastwood because he only did one or two takes. And one day, Matt said, ""Could I ever do another one?"" and Clint said, ""Anytime you want to do another take, you can, but I'm fine, because I hired you to be the actor I knew you could be.""

I thought that was really interesting, and certainly on this film that applied here, which is, I hired these people that I knew would absolutely shine in these roles, and they certainly did. So it was less about trying to get them to achieve a performance, and much more about trying to create an environment where they could feel safe and empowered to do that performance.

On Martindale playing the matriarch

Very few people are able to communicate a sense of reality. It's almost like she's not acting, certainly in this movie, she's just living through this experience that I think a lot of families have experienced, to have a parent be ill. She brings such humanity and grace to the situation that you feel that you're not watching a movie. At least I sometimes feel like I'm not watching a movie. It almost becomes like you're watching a home movie, and that's a very rare thing to be able to communicate, that she feels like your mom.

On growing up and loving comedy

I think from the age of 6 I tried to never miss a 'Saturday Night Live' — a weird admission I'm making now, on air, because I don't think my parents ever knew ...

I was more of the geeky comedy nerd than anything. I think from the age of 6 I tried to never miss a Saturday Night Live — a weird admission I'm making now, on air, because I don't think my parents ever knew that I was sneaking downstairs to watch every Saturday night. ... I always loved the energy that was coming off Saturday Night Live and things like that.

Growing up, I think that performance and trying to be more of the class clown or trying to be funny for my family was all I really cared about, but I never had the intention of being an actor. Actually, when I went to college I was dead set on being an English teacher, which again, probably came from a movie. I probably saw Dead Poets Society and said, ""Oh yeah, just get kids to stand on desks, that sounds like a good life!""

On how his parents reacted when he decided to pursue acting

I remember my parents came to the final performance at this theater school, and the next morning we were driving home, and I hadn't talked about this with them at all, and I just said in the back of the car, I said, ""I want to move to New York and be an actor.""

And without hesitation my mom said, ""Great. Just promise me one thing: That in 2 1/2, three years, if you don't have a bite, if there's not that idea that maybe something's coming, you have to pull yourself out of it, because the only thing you can't ask me to do as your mom is tell her son to give up on his dreams."" I thought that was the most profound, unbelievable invitation, and the kindest way to send me out there.

Sure enough, 2 1/2 years later, I actually did call my mom and say, ""Well, I gave it a shot. You were right, nothing's really happening."" I had done some commercials and some off- off- off-Broadway plays, and I said, ""I'm ready to pull out, you were right."" And it was about September when I called her, and then she said, ""Oh, it's September, just finish out the year!"" And three weeks later I got The Office.

On auditioning for the role of Jim Halpert on The Office

I was sitting in line, it was bit of a bizarro, alternate universe feeling, sitting next to six other people who looked exactly like you. And we were all going in for the role of Jim, and they went through the line of the six guys and I was the last person, and the casting director came up and said, ""You know, we're just going to take a break for lunch."" ... So I watched, you know, 50 to 60 people leave the office. ...

They went down to the restaurant, came back up with salads and sandwiches, all these people came back and one guy sat across from me and said, ""Are you nervous?"" And I said, ""Oh no, you either get these things, or you don't. What I'm really nervous about is them screwing up a perfect show. The Americans always have the ability to screw up these amazing British shows and I'm afraid this is going to be another one of them.""

And he said, ""Oh great. I'm Greg Daniels, I'm the executive producer."" And I genuinely almost threw up right on his shoes. ... He later said, ""Honesty is the best policy. It's the reason you got the role.""

I think he's still just being nice. I won't dare try it again by going into auditions now saying, ""I think this movie's going to be horrible,"" and then see if they give me the role.

On breaking character and laughing during takes

I'm the least professional actor you can meet when it comes to breaking. I laugh all the time. There are way too many outtakes of me laughing, and I believe, as the Internet has confirmed, I laugh, I think, like a ""little princess,"" is the quote? I laugh like a little princess. ... When I break that much I, for some reason, have a very high-pitched register that I got to say, I embrace it.

On his on- and off-screen rivalry with Dwight (Rainn Wilson) on The Office

I think the rivalry made us become kind of like brothers. I mean, there's that rivalry between brothers, obviously, and it's not necessarily competitive, it's just this free-spirited thing. ...

One of the things that I got nervous about was play fighting with him, because he's a very good actor, but I, for some reason, would always end up injured when we did any play fighting. So there were all these scenes where he would throw snowballs at me and it actually hurt, or he'd go to push me and he'd push me too hard, and I'd actually get hurt. ...

After years and years and years of him doing all these things to me, there was one time where I'm walking through a door and I slap him in the face, and there was no way to fake that, because I had to actually slap him. I had in my head, ""This is my full payback for all these years."" And Rainn said, ""Listen, you can hit me as hard as you need to, don't worry about it."" And I said, ""OK.""

And so the scene you see in the show is as hard as I've ever hit a human being before, and I have no idea why I took that opportunity, other than it was that brotherly thing of ""I can't let this happen."" So if you go back and watch that scene, you will see Rainn genuinely stunned by how hard I hit him.

I'll never forget ... the cameramen barely remain standing they were laughing so hard, but the assistant cameramen who stand right next to the camera guys making sure they don't bump into anything, fell down on the floor laughing. ... At that moment, I was no longer Jim and he was no longer Dwight, that was John and Rainn's moment."

To Some Controversy

The school opened to much fanfare and some criticism. Critics such as the ACLU say that the school is discriminatory. Renee Montagne talks to Kaya Henderson, chancellor of D.C. Public Schools.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

In Washington, D.C., on Monday morning, the boys who entered a brand-new high school looked like students at any one of the city's elite private academies - blue blazers, khaki pants, white shirts and purple-and-gold-striped ties. But Ron Brown Preparatory High School is public, and there are no girls. That last point has made the new school a little controversial with some in the city. Kaya Henderson is chancellor of D.C. Public Schools. The new school is a favorite project of hers, and she joins us now on the line. Good morning.

KAYA HENDERSON: Good morning.

MONTAGNE: Now, D.C. public schools do have some of the worst graduation rates of any district in the country, particularly with students of color. And all - I guess it's about 110 freshmen boys at this inaugural class are African-American or Latino. And, you know, in welcoming the class, the principal, Benjamin Williams, called them young kings, he called out. What does that say about what you're aiming to do here?

HENDERSON: Well, I think, you know, D.C. Public Schools has been a struggling school district that has been improving by leaps and bounds, including our graduation rates. But even as we see improvements across the district, we see a slower rate of change for African-American and Latino boys. And as we looked at the data, we decided that we needed to take a differentiated approach to moving outcomes for our young men at a much quicker rate. And as we saw them struggling academically, we decided that an all-boys school might be an appropriate solution to help them achieve in a much more quicker way.

MONTAGNE: Well, let's talk about some of the things that you're doing there at the school. I gather it practically bans suspensions, which is a punishment rather common in public schools.

HENDERSON: Well, our approach to dealing with discipline issues is really focused around restorative justice. And what we found is that suspension - sending a kid home because they do something wrong - doesn't actually address the root cause of the issue. But having the young person have to actually admit to what they've done and discuss and apologize and talk about how they're going to restore faith in the community with themselves, we found that to be really powerful at a number of our schools. So that's the approach that we're taking at Ron Brown.

MONTAGNE: And you called it restorative justice - known as.

HENDERSON: Yes.

MONTAGNE: You know, why would this all-boys school be better than a similar public prep school that included girls? I mean, given that there have been other such all-male schools in other cities and all-girl schools, is there proof that this separating of the sexes works?

HENDERSON: Well, I mean, I think that, you know, there are lots of open questions about single-sex education. But when you look at some of the most well-resourced families in the country, many of them choose single-sex education. And we want to make that kind of option available to all of our families. We have an all-girls charter school here in Washington, D.C., that hasn't attracted any attention. But I find it interesting that when we created an all-boys school, there seems to be all of this controversy.

Let me give you a quick example. I have a very good friend whose son matriculated into our - one of our college preparatory high schools here in the city, and he transferred out after his freshman year. And, you know, when I asked him why, he said there are just too many girls. At one of our top college prep high schools, it's 80 percent women, and he didn't feel comfortable. He's a smart guy. He didn't feel comfortable. He didn't feel affirmed. He didn't feel like he could be successful in that situation.

And so I think providing our young men with a space where they are reinforced not just as scholars, but their character is built and their manhood is developed, I think is an important way to do something differently. If we're going to get different results from our young men, we have to try different strategies, and this is one that we think is well worth it, and so do 110 families in the district who have packed the school this first year.

MONTAGNE: Well, let me, though, get back to that. The ACLU is one of the critics of this new school. It issued a report in the spring called Leaving Girls Behind, saying that D.C. Public Schools make a mistake by putting in - and this is a $20 million initiative, I gather, this new school. Is the charter school for girls, say - is there - has there been less put into it? Is that it?

HENDERSON: No. I mean, in fact, I think the $20 million is what we've committed to an empowering-males-of-color strategy that includes the school. It includes training our teachers to disabuse them of bias around young men. It includes a grants program for our schools to innovate around new strategies to reach our boys. It also includes a tutoring program for our elementary school young men who are struggling. So there's an entire district-wide initiative, and I think that that has attracted attention.

But just because it's attracted attention, it doesn't mean that it's not the right thing to do. We know that one size does not fit all. And if we're going to ensure that our young men have the best chance possible to be successful, we have to differentiate our strategies. As we look at our data, we see that our young women have different challenges, and so we're trying to develop a set of strategies that will specifically address young women strategies. And we think that that's actually appropriate.

MONTAGNE: Well, thank you very much for joining us.

HENDERSON: Thank you for having me.

MONTAGNE: Kaya Henderson is the chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, where Ron Brown Preparatory High School - an all-boy public school - opened this week.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Christopher Polk/Getty Images Christopher Polk/Getty Images

Take a look at a picture of The Chainsmokers and you'll see everything many people hate about mainstream electronic dance music. Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, the two DJ/producers who go by that name, are two white guys with David Beckham haircuts and perfectly coiffed five o'clock shadows who stick their tongues out while posing in front of the partying throngs their big beats entertain. ""They are frat bros themselves,"" manager Adam Alpert, who assembled the duo via a ""man date"" in 2012, said to Forbes when asked about The Chainsmokers' appeal to young male music fans. They first found live success, in fact, on the frat circuit, playing the kinds of parties where young women do not always feel safe.

Here's a weird thing, though: The singles that have made The Chainsmokers a phenomenally successful recording act don't seem bro-tastic at all. The duo currently has the No. 1 and No. 8 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, ""Closer"" and ""Don't Let Me Down"" respectively, and both feature women's voices not only as key elements, but as the central ruling force. That's very common in dance music and has been since the disco era, when famed songwriters and producers like Paul Jabarra and Giorgio Moroder tapped into the power of African-American soul queens to make their mixes transcendent. Yet, The Chainsmokers' hits are different: They're more conversational, inspired by the intimate strains of indie rock and bedroom electronica. And these songs are not huge party anthems. They're more akin to singer-songwriter confessions, sad and uncertain even when their rhythms build.

Two years ago, few would have expected The Chainsmokers to make this kind of music. The pair's first viral success came through fleshing out a timeworn female stereotype. ""#Selfie"" captures the inner life of a 21st-century ""dumb blonde,"" as this figure was called in the Marilyn Monroe era. This airhead — another era's name for her — shares her molly-addled world view with her friends in the ladies' room as she ponders the status of a potential hookup, throws shade at her fellow clubgoers (""Who wears cheetah?""), and debates what filter to use on the photo she's posting to her Instagram account. She's ridiculous, and so fun to imitate.

The ""#Selfie"" rap critiques millennials' alleged obsession with posing and performing while reflecting a more timeless masculine tendency to treat young women, especially those who try to wield power through beauty, with fond condescension. Some critics identified the song as sexist, although by aiming its barbs at a certain kind of woman, it also gained plenty of female fans. The rap Taggart and Pall wrote isn't really that witty; it's the manic performance by the woman who intones it, Alexis Campisi, that makes ""#Selfie"" irresistible. The Chainsmokers turned to Campisi, then a Baruch College undergraduate with no pop aspirations, because of her knack for satirizing pop frivolity in ways that acknowledge its allure. (Her Britney impression on Vine is hilarious.) When Campisi snaps, ""Let me take a selfie,"" you can feel the whole club turn to photobomb her: This girl might be vain and act scatterbrained, but she is the charismatic center of her scene.

It was after ""#Selfie"" became a Top 40 novelty hit that The Chainsmokers began aiming for a more durably successful sound. Their follow-up, ""Kanye"" was a collaboration with the L.A. dream-pop duo sirenXX that captures the sadness of regular people dazzled by celebrities and disappointed that they can't join their ranks. (The video showed a Latina hotel maid enjoying a Cinderella night, then returning to her daughter and partner in their humble Los Angeles home.) It set a tone. Nearly every subsequent Chainsmokers success features women vocalists whose melancholic observations and confessions offset the busy buzziness of the beat-driven mix. Most are little known; the DJs found them via music blogs or the aggregator Hype Machine. (Let's hope they gain more recognition than did some earlier women whose voices were featured on major dance hits, like Martha Wash, who had to go to court to be recognized.) There's ""Roses,"" a seduction narrative turned off-kilter by the contributions of singer-songwriter Elizabeth Mencel, who calls herself ROZES; the searching ""Inside Out,"" featuring the trilling voice of the Swedish artist Charlee; ""New York City,"" whose singer, Victoria Zaro, has a voice like a teardrop; and ""Don't Let Me Down,"" the closest thing the duo has to a house music-style soul epiphany, with the plaintive stylings of the teenager Daya lifting it aloft.

The most intriguing Chainsmokers song so far is ""Closer,"" a duet between primary lyricist Drew Taggart and the Tumblr-propelled rising star Halsey. A tale of two estranged lovers reuniting for a night in a hotel bar, it unfolds in narrowly cast melodic phrases interwoven with flat, nearly muffled synth lines; a snare drum echoes in the background, as if to get things moving, but the overall effect is quiet and furtive, suiting Taggart's lyrics about intimacies grounded in regret. ""Baby, pull me closer in the back seat of your Rover, that I know you can't afford,"" Taggart moans, and that's the song's hook: This night isn't a triumph for anyone, or even a release. It's just a moment's pleasure. The track intensifies dynamically, but doesn't really climax. Taggart's and Halsey's voices, hesitant and estranged from each other by the slightest Auto-Tune tweaks, unite in a fugitive moment of release, the way an ignored car payment might make a girl feel rich for one self-indulgent weekend. His voice is almost tender; hers is almost sorrowful.

It's unusual for a pop song to occupy this unsettled space, where neither heartbreak nor delight provides genuine emotional release. But it's where people live much of the time, especially when things are uncertain. Building its love story around diminished expectations, ""Closer"" feels hauntingly appropriate for a time when the negatives associated with sex, from the anti-romantic nature of hook-up culture to the prevalence of sexual violence, are in clear view. The encounter the not-so-dumb blonde of ""#Selfie"" contemplates – ""Oh my god, Jason just texted me, should I go home with him?"" — might be the wreckage the heroine of ""Closer"" confronts, her eyes clear this time.

Much of dance-pop right now exists within this melancholy atmosphere, the inverse of the triumphal one occupied by anthemic hits like Sia's ""Cheap Thrills"" or Katy Perry's rising, roaring musical fireworks displays. The voices that define this twilit dance-pop space are feminine. They're different than the wondrous divas of disco and house music, though they do have precursors, like Crystal Waters and the Rickie Lee Jones sample in The Orb's ""Little Fluffy Clouds."" These singers are dreamy and inward-turning, or slightly odd, sharing muttered confidences instead of preaching the gospel. Though most are white, Rihanna, with her Caribbean lilt and cool demeanor, is a ruling spirit. So is Drake, whose ""soft"" rapping style and emotionally intelligent lyrics was, by his own accord, influenced as much by women pioneers at the juncture between hip-hop and R&B, such as Aaliyah and Lauryn Hill, as by male rappers.

Rihanna and Drake established themselves in the age of Auto-Tune and other voice-altering studio tools. These computer programs have changed compositional techniques. For many producers, the human voice has become more of a tonal element than a dominant force, even when it holds a song's central melodic line; building a track, they bend voices, distort them, integrate them as another texture complementing a track's beats and synthesized effects. This happened in earlier dance music movements, too – in his 1979 essay ""In Defense of Disco,"" Richard Dyer wrote of Diana Ross's ""'unreally' sweet, porcelain fragile voice"" as an ideal one for cultivating fantasy and capturing ""the intensity of the passing relationship"" that was key within gay male dance scenes. Today's voices capture a related but different kind of tension, one that's less about cultivating the imagination through chance encounters and more about accepting indeterminacy as a personal status quo.

Rihanna's voice always sounds slightly imperfect, exquisitely ordinary: It's a little flat, a little rough, not perfectly toned and ready to deliver a Produnuva vault like Beyonce's. This is what Halsey's voice is like, too, and the cracks in her phrasing makes her portrayals of millennial anomie more poignant. ""All we do is think about the feelings that we hide,"" she sings in ""Drive,"" one of the outstanding cuts on her debut album, Badlands; the line captures the predicament of young people who feel they're caught between genuine self-expression and fulfilling a series of roles. That's an eternal teenage problem, exacerbated exponentially in the age of avatars. Like her obvious predecessor Lorde, Halsey embodies the weary precociousness of her generation, the kids who've seized technology and built whole new virtual worlds by the time they've hit middle school, but who recognize that their precocious virtual lives don't make their real minds or bodies any less vulnerable. ""I think there's a flaw in my code,"" Halsey intones in ""Gasoline,"" a fan favorite. ""My heart is gold and my hands are cold.""

Perhaps young women's voices best express today's most compelling ambiguities because, after centuries, they're still fighting to control the fate of their own bodies. There's never been more awareness of the struggle women face simply to move freely without being violated, without having their drinks drugged or being assaulted, possibly by people in authority whom they thought they could trust. The EDM scene is notoriously male-dominated and has often proven unsafe for young women. ""We're trying to smoke the beehive,"" one hopped-up ""EDM bro"" told a Vice reporter before venturing into a crowd at last year's Coachella festival, unabashedly announcing his intent to goad women toward his erogenous zones. Dance music critic Philip Sherburne has noted that the imagery and language promoting EDM encourages this ""voyeuristic, objectifying male gaze."" And which artists do these bros love the most? The Chainsmokers, for one. In light of this, it can be hard to tell if male DJs centering their work on women's self-expression is exploitation, compensation or the return of the repressed. It's almost as if the male fantasy conveyed in many dance songs is speaking back and finally telling some truths.

One thing is clear: EDM needs more forthright female energy. In many ways it's following behind other genres. Young women are this summer's story in country and in indie rock. They've dominated the Top 40 for years. Real parity in the DJ booth and the producer's chair is a goal the genre's leaders need to embrace. Organizations like the female:pressure network are fighting for it. It is becoming clear that fans of this music want to hear what women think and feel, and not just about taking selfies."

Turkish troops crossed into Syria early Wednesday, carrying out airstrikes and launching artillery fire to clear ISIS militants from a border area in coordination with the U.S.-led coalition.

The offensive is Turkey's largest military mission of its kind in the Syria conflict. It comes days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the militant group, also known as Daesh, for a suicide bombing at a wedding on Saturday in Gaziantep, near the Syrian border, that killed at least 54 people.

NPR Istanbul correspondent Peter Kenyon details the Turkish offensive, which has been dubbed Operation Euphrates Shield:

""Turkish artillery unleashed a major barrage into northern Syria, and then Turkish F-16s took off. They fired airstrikes on Islamic State targets from the border area as far as Aleppo, we're told. ""State media says Turkish special forces entered Syria on the ground, and TV footage that I'm seeing looks like it's showing Turkish tanks operating across the border as well. So this is a U.S.-led coalition operation, they're trying to clear ISIS from the border, but it's with unusually heavy Turkish participation.""

The initial focus has been an ISIS-held border town called Jarablus, Peter reports. ""Hundreds of Syrian opposition fighters"" also took part in the Jarablus offensive, according to The Associated Press.

Citing Turkey's foreign minister, Peter says the offensive is ""not going to stop right there at the border."" And Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavosoglu says his country ""will provide any necessary contribution to cleanse Daesh from our neighbors Iraq and Syria.""

Erdogan says Wednesday's operation was in response to the ""threat posed by terror groups like Daesh and the PYD,"" referring to a U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish group that has been battling the Islamic State. As the state-run Anadolu News Agency reports, Erdogan ""stressed that both Daesh and the PYD threatened Turkey from northern Syria and said neither terror groups nor their supporters stood a chance against the unity and solidarity of Turkey.""

That underscores the complicated diplomatic environment the U.S. is navigating as it targets ISIS in Syria. ""Wednesday's dual-purpose operation puts Turkey on track for a confrontation with the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria, the most effective fighting force against IS in the area,"" as The Associated Press reports.

This isn't the first time Turkey has sent troops across the border. As NPR reported, Turkish armored vehicles crossed into Syria in February 2015 on a rescue mission to evacuate Turkish troops that were guarding a shrine near Aleppo that held the body of Suleyman Shah, who was the grandfather of the first Ottoman sultan.

Meanwhile, Vice President Biden is visiting Turkey, in what is the highest-level U.S. trip to the country since a failed coup attempt last month.

Relations between the U.S. and Turkey have been tense, because Turkey blames that failed coup on Fethullah Gulen, a cleric based in Pennsylvania. Gulen denies any involvement in the attempt, and the U.S. has thus far rejected Turkey's extradition requests.

""There's been a big spike in anti-American sentiment here, and it's not being discouraged by the government; some say it's actually encouraging it,"" Peter reports. ""So this visit is really a chance to show that the Turkish-American relationship is a long-running one, it's suffered through some rough patches in the past and has always come through.""

But diplomats on both sides have told Peter that the state of the relationship is ""the worst they've seen it in decades."""

The Bombay to Barcelona Library Cafe sits on one side of a noisy street in a lower-middle-class neighborhood of Mumbai, India, not far from the city's swanky new international airport.

Wedged in a block with a clinic and a hardware store, this modest-sized cafe has only four tables. There's an open kitchen with bar stools at the counter and a small library at the back, with books donated by patrons. The walls are orange, and some repurposed aluminum kettle lamps and tea glass lamp shades give the room a warm and earthy tone. Outside, there's a little patio with a couple of benches, and a bright green awning that stands out against the gloomy gray of the concrete structures around it.

This ordinary-looking cafe is on an extraordinary mission — to be inclusive. In a country where cafes are used exclusively by the growing middle class, this cafe has opened its doors to people from all walks of life — from cab and rickshaw drivers and street kids to the average office worker. Anyone who can't afford a $2 cup of coffee, often the cheapest item in an average Indian cafe, can find something tasty and affordable here.

A cup of tea on the patio costs only 10 rupees (15 U.S. cents), the same as at any roadside tea stall. The rest of the menu is limited but wholesome: sandwiches, quiche, tortillas, tapas. There is also dessert, bonbons and coffees.

The cafe is a labor of love for proprietor Amin Sheikh, who spent his early childhood on the streets of Mumbai, where food was key to survival but hard to come by. The cafe's servers are also former street children.

The son of a domestic worker, Sheikh was 5 years old when he ran away from home and his job at a tea shop. For three years, he scavenged for scraps in garbage bins and begged for food or money in trains and stations. He eventually found his way to an orphanage called Snehasadan, where meals were regular but basic, and the best dessert was ""whatever candy cost the least"" in stores outside, he recalls.

Today, Sheikh is also a book author and a successful tour operator, but success didn't come easily. He dropped out after seventh grade and learned to drive, eventually finding employment as the chauffeur and Man Friday of a well-to-do man.

""When I was a driver, I never had money to have a coffee at one of the [Indian] cafes,"" he says. ""In that much money, I could get a full chicken meal and a tea. I don't understand why a cup of coffee is that expensive — has it got gold in it? Has it come from the moon? Everyone deserves to go somewhere nice.""

In 2002, he bought his own car and started giving guided tours of the city. The next year, he had the opportunity to visit clients and friends in Spain and saw a different world. ""In Spain, I saw everyone has the same coffee at the same coffee shop and it costs them all the same,"" he says. ""With one euro, a shoeshine boy or a manager can have the very best coffee. Nobody told me you cannot sit here, go somewhere else."" It was a revelation.

Because Indian society is much more stratified and class-conscious. ""If I had gone to a coffee shop, this is how high society would think: 'What is this bloody driver doing here?'"" says Sheikh. ""But this bloody driver is also human.""

He decided to create a place for drivers like him and other ordinary people. ""Why not a basic place for basic people? Without spelling it out, you can give someone dignity without preaching about it."" And he realized he could close the loop by employing kids from his orphanage.

For seven years, Sheikh put aside money, even writing and publishing an autobiography in 2012. Twelve thousand copies and eight language editions later he says, ""Whatever money I made from selling my book at churches, traffic signals, talks has gone into this café.""

Affordability and dignity aren't Sheikh's only goals. Quality is high on his agenda, too.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Bombay to Barcelona Library Cafe Courtesy of Bombay to Barcelona Library Cafe

""I could use crap ingredients, I could parcel out diabetes and heart disease without a problem, but I want quality,"" Sheikh says. ""I want the ingredients to be nutritious.""

So instead of cutting corners and using the cheap, local hydrogenated baking chocolate, he's using Belgian chocolate from Europe. But he's working on sourcing other organic ingredients, including milk, locally.

And while he's at it, why not introduce his customers to some foreign foods, too? ""In Spain, everyone knows some Indian food,"" he says. ""Everybody knows chicken tikka, so why shouldn't kids here know tortillas and Spanish cookies?""

The cafe's cookies are divine — crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The recipe comes from Figueres, a small town in Catalonia, just outside Barcelona, Spain. A couple — Carlos and Maria Antonia Pereze, who run a restaurant — had read his book and they were moved by his story. When they contacted Sheikh and learned that he was ready to start his dream cafe, they took three weeks off to come help him start up.

The night I visited the cafe was the Perezes' last in town. Carlos was pulling a batch of cookies from the oven while overseeing the making of more batter. Maria Antonia was going over checklists at a table. Later that evening, after their last guests had finished their cake and left, the staff and volunteers gathered together. Over the four-way multi-lingual conversation — English, Catalan, Hindi (India's national language) and Marathi (Mumbai's local language) — there were last-minute instructions, reminders and hugs. The couple's affection for the cafe staff shone through.

Anil Kurup, the cafe's baker, is an alum of Snehasadan, the same orphanage that Sheikh grew up in. Trained in the bakery section of a big hotel chain on Sheikh's urging a few years ago, Kurup has now added tortillas and cookies to his repertoire under the Perezes' tutelage. ""When I was growing up, I never dreamed that I'd get to eat any of this, let alone make it,"" he says.

Business at the cafe is still picking up, but Sheikh is OK with that. He tells his staff that all good things take time.

""See, I don't want to be a business,"" Sheikh says. ""I want to get people to be human beings.""

Amir, 12, and his cousin Mehran, 11, live in the neighborhood and are on their fourth visit in three days. They sit on a bench on the patio, enjoying their Spanish hot chocolate, smacking their lips between sips.

""I like the experience,"" says Mehran. ""And the hot chocolate, the cookies, the books."" His cousin Amir is excited because ""Uncle (Sheikh) told us there will be comics and kids' books, too.""

The boys are delighted that there's a nice place they can afford. Their monthly allowance is about $11 each, but with a cup of hot chocolate priced at 60 cents, they can enjoy some of the treats here. They tell me they've peeped into fancy coffee shops before, but this is the first one they've been to. That access, and the contented smiles on their faces, is just what Sheikh is aiming for."

Canada's national police force says it is allowing women in its ranks to wear the hijab.

A spokesman confirmed Wednesday that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, known as the Mounties, recently approved the headscarf for its Muslim officers.

""This is intended to better reflect the diversity in our communities and encourage more Muslim women to consider the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as a career option,"" Scott Bardsley, spokesman for Canada's public safety minister, told the Canada-based Global News.

Bardsley said other police forces in Canada have made similar religious accommodations, as have countries such as the U.S., U.K., Sweden and Norway.

Here's more from Global News:

""Three types of hijabs were tested last month before one was approved, according to an internal memo between Goodale and RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, obtained by Montreal's La Presse. The memo also said the hijab could be removed quickly if needed, and did not pose a risk to officers.""

The Mounties, easily recognized by their scarlet jackets and wide-brim hats, trace their history — and uniform — to the late 1800s, when recruits formed the North-West Mounted Police and headed west to stop an illegal American whiskey trade.

Women were allowed to join as uniformed members in 1974. And an RCMP assessment of gender in 2012 found that women represented 20 percent of the force's 19,258 regular members.

LePresse reports that the RCMP has received some 30 requests for cultural or religious accommodations over the past two years — mostly from male officers wanting to grow beards.

The hijab is not the first religious or cultural garment approved for RCMP officers. In 1990, Global News writes, ""the RCMP made the controversial decision to allow Sikh officers to wear turbans as part of their uniforms.""

In the U.S., the Defense Department relaxed rules to allow case-by-case religious exceptions for military dress in 2014, as The Two-Way reported at the time."

Bernie Sanders is launching a new political organization. It's called Our Revolution. It aims to support candidates and, according to its website, ""advance the progressive agenda that we believe in.""

But the revolution is getting off to a rocky start.

Eight key staffers abruptly resigned over the weekend in a dispute over the group's leadership and legal structure.

Sanders himself is set to address followers on Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET for the launch of the group. You can watch that here:

YouTube

Among the departures was the group's organizing director, Claire Sandberg, who also worked on the Sanders presidential campaign. Sandberg is critical of Our Revolution's director, former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, for structuring the group as a 501(c)(4) (the section of the IRS code for a ""social welfare"" organization).

Sandberg charges that Weaver did that so ""he could take big checks from billionaires.""

But the 501(c)(4) status also means the group can't contribute directly to candidates many Sanders backers support, such as Tim Canova, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary against former Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The incumbent has been a target of Sanders supporters, who charge she improperly backed Hillary Clinton for the nomination.

Allowing unlimited contributions from anonymous groups is also the polar opposite of the presidential campaign, in which Sanders rarely failed to point out his average contribution was $27.

But Weaver says there is a difference between a presidential campaign and a group like Our Revolution. In a presidential race, he said, ""You don't want somebody elected, who is beholden to wealthy individuals or interests.""

But in the case of a nonprofit like Our Revolution, Weaver added, ""I have nothing to offer people in return for their support"" other than pushing forward the progressive goals and agenda that those who supported Sanders share.

There is another reason for the walkout at Our Revolution: Weaver himself.

Sanders supporters like Sandberg blame Weaver for Sanders' coming up short in his quest for the nomination. She said bluntly that those who worked on the campaign ""saw that his failed leadership is what cost Bernie the nomination.""

Weaver shrugs off the criticism, saying he, too, was disappointed by the outcome, and that ""if it's cathartic for people to sort of make me the lightning rod for their upset about not having won, I'm certainly willing to play that role for them.""

What's unclear is what role the Vermont senator will have in Our Revolution. As a federal officeholder, Sanders faces limits on the kind of fundraising he can do for other candidates.

Weaver said Our Revolution aims to tap into the enthusiasm that led to Sanders' winning 23 primaries and caucuses, by supporting candidates for down-ballot races and working to train future candidates to create, as he put it, ""a progressive bench."""

Newborn conjoined twins were evacuated from a Syrian rebel stronghold to the capital, Damascus, after lengthy negotiations earlier this month.

But brothers Moaz and Nawras died early Wednesday before they could be transferred to a hospital outside Syria for urgent heart surgery. It's a tragic end to a story that was the subject of an international campaign to save their lives.

As we reported, the babies, who were joined at the chest, were born in the besieged area of Eastern Ghouta on July 23. Their hearts shared a sac, according to the BBC. The World Health Organization says it took days of negotiations to evacuate them. The hospital in Eastern Ghouta was short of supplies and unable to perform the surgery needed to separate them.

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a press release that Moaz and Nawras died of heart failure. The organization says the pair had been accepted to a hospital in Rome, and ""all formal leave approvals were signed in order to travel.""

Hospitals in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had also offered to treat the twins, as NPR's Allison Meuse reported.

Mona Kurdy, a spokeswoman for the Red Crescent, told The Wall Street Journal that ""approval for the twins to leave Syria was granted Monday, but by then their condition had already started to worsen.""

""There is no one who wasn't cooperative,"" Kurdy said, according to the Journal.

However, Mohamad Katoub, advocacy manager for the Syrian American Medical Society, told the Journal that Syria's Foreign Ministry was responsible for the ultimately fatal delays. The ministry was "" 'looking for a medical solution that matched its political interests' and trying to secure medical treatment for the twins in a country with friendlier relations with Syria,"" he said.

Khatoub tweeted a portrait of the twins by Syrian artist Akram Abo Alfoz:

Nawras and Moaz passed away this early Morning. The whole world couldn't have the permission to evacuate them. pic.twitter.com/3hJvVa6zSj — Mohamad Katoub (@aboali_majed) August 24, 2016

SAMS also said in a statement that the Red Crescent ""kept Moaz and Nawras at a private hospital in Damascus for almost two weeks despite the urgency of the case"" without releasing any information, which it says ""hindered the evacuation process.""

SAMS led the international effort to evacuate the twins, drawing attention to their plight and eliciting a message of support from U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power.

""The tragic death of these two brave souls could have easily been prevented,"" says SAMS President Ahmed Tarakji. ""This is unacceptable."""

The Ubiquitous EpiPen

EpiPens are in your friend's purse and your kid's backpack. The school nurse has a few, as does Grandma.

The medicine inside — epinephrine — has been around forever, and the handy gadget that injects it into your leg is not particularly new either.

So members of Congress, responding to their angry constituents, want to know why the price of the EpiPen, which can reverse a life-threatening allergic reaction, has risen about fivefold in the past decade.

The wholesale price of a single pen was about $47 in 2007, and it rose to $284 this summer, according to Richard Evans, a health care analyst at SSR. But consumers can no longer buy a single pen, so the retail price to fill a prescription today at Walgreens is about $633, according to GoodRX.

It's the latest in a string of controversies over rising drug prices that have caught the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. At least three senators have called for investigations into the price of the EpiPen, and Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have sent letters to Mylan, the drug's manufacturer, demanding an explanation for the increase.

Blumenthal went a step further. ""I demand that Mylan take immediate action to lower the price of EpiPens for all Americans that rely on this product for their health and safety,"" he wrote in a letter to the company.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Mylan has violated antitrust laws in its marketing of the EpiPen.

And Hillary Clinton weighed in, calling the price increases ""outrageous.""

""It's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them,"" the Democratic presidential nominee said in a statement on her Facebook page.

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an email, ""We have reached out to every member of Congress who has sent us a letter, and we look forward to meeting with them and responding to their questions as soon as possible.""

She did not immediately comment on Clinton's statement.

The EpiPen is a long, plastic tube that automatically injects a dose of epinephrine — or adrenaline — into a person's thigh to stop an allergic reaction. It's easy to use and portable.

Mylan bought rights to the EpiPen in 2008 and launched an aggressive marketing and awareness campaign. That effort has made the so-called auto-injector a must-have for anyone with an allergy — perhaps to bee stings or tree nuts — that may trigger anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction in which the airwaves swell and close.

According to an account by Bloomberg Businessweek, the company considered selling off rights to the drug, which is an old product, but instead launched a campaign to boost sales. Revenue rose from $200 million to more than $1 billion a year.

The company itself touts its campaign ""for increased anaphylaxis awareness"" as what has helped drive prescriptions and sales of the device.

""Ensuring access to epinephrine — the only first-line treatment for anaphylaxis — is a core part of our mission,"" Mylan said in a press release this week.

And certainly people with life-threatening allergies are better off with easy access to the drug.

But Mylan is better off too.

That's because each EpiPen prescription creates a win-win sales cycle for Mylan.

An EpiPen prescription actually includes two injectors. The FDA in 2010 recommended that patients have access to two, in case the first doesn't work, and Mylan complied by taking its single EpiPens off the market and offering them in two-packs.

But often one prescription is not enough. People want the pens at home, in their offices or schools, perhaps in the car. So they might buy three or more two-pen packs. Schools and businesses also often keep them on hand in case a student or customer has an unexpected reaction.

That's a lot of EpiPens.

Plus, epinephrine has a short shelf life, so people have to replace their EpiPens each year, even if they've never used them.

That's how the drug has become a cash cow for Mylan, which last year moved its headquarters from the U.S. to the Netherlands.

But consumers are fed up. Almost 90,000 people signed a petition to Congress asking for an investigation. About 40,000 of those signatures came in on Wednesday.

Mylan says it is working to keep the medication cheap for consumers, by offering $100 coupons to offset high insurance copayments. In a statement released Monday, the company said about 80 percent of patients with insurance get the EpiPen free.

The statement didn't mention the retail price or the price increases at all. Instead, the company focused on insurance policies with high deductibles that shift costs to patients.

""We encourage all patients and families to thoroughly review and understand their healthcare insurance coverage,"" the statement said.

EpiPen's name recognition means doctors who want to prescribe adrenaline to an allergy-prone patient usually just turn to it. There is no specific EpiPen generic, so pharmacists can't substitute a cheaper alternative.

But that alternative does exist. Another auto-injector known as Adrenaclick is available in generic form at Wal-Mart for $141, according to GoodRX.

It's unclear how far the threats of a congressional investigation into the EpiPen will go.

But the prospect does present one awkward situation. The CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. In the time that the price of the EpiPen has been skyrocketing, so has Bresch's compensation. Last year, she earned about $18.2 million, according to the New York Times. That's up from about $2.5 million in 2007.

In earlier investigations into drug prices, the chiefs of many companies have been grilled and lectured harshly by lawmakers. It's unclear whether the angry senators will be as inclined to be as aggressive with the daughter of one of their colleagues."

Behold the Dreamers by Imbolo Mbue Hardcover, 382 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

In 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. It took just hours for the catastrophic effects of the company's failure to become apparent to ordinary people all across the world, even ones who had never before heard terms like ""subprime mortgage"" and ""collateralized debt obligation.""

Jende Jonga and his wife, Neni, two of the main characters in Imbolo Mbue's excellent debut novel, Behold the Dreamers, are among those people. Her book isn't the first work of fiction to grapple with the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, but it's surely one of the best.

Jende and Neni have recently immigrated to America from the city of Limbe in Cameroon, hoping to build a better life for their young son, Liomi, a sweet and sensitive six-year-old who idolizes his father.

They're barely able to make ends meet. Neni works as a home health aide while attending college — she dreams of one day enrolling in pharmacy school — while Jende drives a cab. Their luck changes suddenly, though, when Jende finds work as a personal chauffeur for a Lehman Brothers executive named Clark Edwards and his family. The hours are long, but the salary is a massive improvement over his previous job.

Clark grows to trust Jende, and Neni eventually takes a temporary job cleaning and cooking at the Edwards' second home. It doesn't take long before Jende and Neni both learn that the Edwards' marriage isn't as perfect as it might seem. This becomes painfully apparent after Lehman Brothers declares bankruptcy just weeks before what would become a historic presidential election.

'Behold the Dreamers' isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse.

Meanwhile, Jende is forced to confront problems of his own. While his wife is in America on a student visa, he's in the country waiting for his asylum application to be approved. But he's not really facing persecution in his home country, and he's hoping the smooth-talking immigration lawyer he's hired can persuade a judge otherwise.

He can't bear the thought of returning to Cameroon. When he talks about America, it's with rapturous joy, and an unflinching belief in the promise of his adopted country. ""America has something for everyone, sir,"" he enthuses to Clark. ""Look at Obama, sir. Who is his mother? Who is his father? They are not big people in the government. ... The man is a black man with no father or mother, trying to be president over a country!""

Those who lived through the turbulent final years of the George W. Bush administration remember that it brought out the worst in a lot of people — not just in the bankers and politicians who let the crisis occur in the first place, but in ordinary citizens brought to the edge by the threat of financial ruin.

Mbue realizes this, and she does not pull punches. Behold the Dreamers is, at times, hard to read — not because of her writing, which is excellent, but because the characters keep getting hit, over and over again, by horrible circumstances beyond their control. Jende is reminded that ""bad news has a way of slithering into good days and making a mockery of complacent joys;"" Neni feels ""crushed"" by her own feelings of helplessness, ""the fact that she had traveled to America only to be reminded of how powerless she was, how unfair life could be.""

Behold the Dreamers isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse. In one scene, Clark's wife commiserates with a wealthy friend about the crisis. Her friend's priorities are almost comically misplaced: ""But it's scary how bad this could get,"" she says, ""When people start talking about flying coach and selling vacation homes ...""

That's not to say Mbue doesn't lack compassion for her characters — while some are oblivious, they have real problems of their own, and she's never cruel or condescending. Mbue's heart is with the Jonga family, torn between their love for — and disappointment with — America. But it's also with the Edwards family, unable to cope with the thought that their days of privilege might soon be coming to an end.

Behold the Dreamers is a remarkable debut. Mbue is a wonderful writer with an uncanny ear for dialogue — there are no false notes here, no narrative shortcuts, and certainly no manufactured happy endings. It's a novel that depicts a country both blessed and doomed, on top of the world, but always at risk of losing its balance. It is, in other words, quintessentially American."

Back in 1972, John Lennon hired Leon Wildes, an immigration attorney who had no idea who he was.

Wildes' son, Michael, remembers his father coming home to tell his mother about their first meeting.

""And he said, 'A singer by the name of Jack Lemon and his wife Yoko Moto,' "" Michael recalls. ""My mom looked at him like he wasn't well. 'Are you talking about the Beatles and John Lennon?' My father said, 'Yeah!' ""

Over the next five years, Lennon and Wildes often were caught on camera outside immigration court in New York City — as well as on late-night talk shows, such as NBC's The Tomorrow Show With Tom Snyder.

""What is your status in the country right now?"" Snyder asked Lennon during a show taping in 1975.

Arizona Dreamers Five Years Later 6:32

""That's why Leon's here,"" Lennon answers. He glances over at Leon Wildes sitting across from him on a dark TV set. ""What, what am I, Leon?""

""Well, John was charged with being deportable in the U.S. for being an overstay,"" says Wildes, who has written a new book about Lennon's deportation case called John Lennon vs. The U.S.A.

In other words, Lennon was on a tourist visa that expired while he was helping his wife, Yoko Ono, with a custody battle over her daughter from a previous marriage.

So Wildes got that visa extended. But immigration officials gave them only just over month before Lennon would have to leave. Later, Wildes put in an application for a green card, which was denied.

But Lennon still wanted to stay in America.

""I like to be here because this is where the music came from,"" Lennon said. ""This is what influenced my whole life and got me where I am today.""

Wildes appealed the denial.

But FBI files show that the Nixon administration wanted Lennon, along with his anti-war activism and influence over young voters, out of the country.

So Wildes started digging for another route.

""I always had a feeling that the government must have a program to exercise some discretion,"" Wildes said.

Asked why he had that feeling, Wildes said it was ""because there were rumors of certain guys who were — had critical criminal backgrounds and bad immigration histories and seemed to be still around.""

Those guys probably benefited from what's now known as ""prosecutorial discretion."" It's based mainly on the premise that the federal government doesn't have enough resources to deport all of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

Under federal law, immigration officials can choose to prioritize certain deportation cases while holding off on other ones for humanitarian or political reasons.

The problem at the time was that Wildes didn't have proof that this kind of program existed until he filed a Freedom of Information Act request.

""When the box came into my office, there was jubilation!"" Wildes said. ""Unbelievable feeling that I had succeeded.""

In the end, Lennon received a green card, which allowed him to stay in the U.S. But those files led U.S. immigration officials to publicize a secret policy.

""Before the work of Mr. Wildes, deferred action was a complete mystery because there wasn't even a guideline for attorneys and noncitizens,"" says Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, who teaches immigration law at Penn State University and wrote Beyond Deportation: The Role of Prosecutorial Discretion in Immigration Cases.

The files showed that for decades, the government had shielded some immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from deportation because of their sympathetic cases. The Obama administration used that policy to create the original Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

""Eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization,"" said President Obama in a 2012 announcement.

An expansion of the program, as well as the creation of a similar program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, is currently on hold because of legal challenges.

But today, the original DACA program covers more than 700,000 young people brought to the U.S. as children — all in part because of that immigrant from Liverpool."

The surprise TV hit of the summer is a show that looks like it could have been made 30 years ago. Netflix's Stranger Things is a suspense horror show set in 1983. It takes place in small Indiana town where one night a boy goes missing. There's a mysterious government lab, a monster and boys riding around town on bikes.

If you're hearing echoes of E.T., The Goonies or any number of beloved 1980s classics, that's not a coincidence. Matt and Ross Duffer, the show's twin brother creators, tell NPR's Ari Shapiro that when they pitched Stranger Things, they didn't use a storyboard or a written synopsis; instead, they assembled a trailer made of snippets from '80s films.

Interview Highlights

On the trailer they made to pitch the show

Enlarge this image toggle caption Curtis Brown/Netflix Curtis Brown/Netflix

Matt Duffer: I think it was around 30 different movies — a lot of them were from the '80s, but not entirely from the '80s — movies that we cut together to kind of tell the story of the show. But it was cool because we had a lot of shots from E.T., but we scored it with, like, John Carpenter synth music. So I think it helped us figure out what the show was going to feel like, and I think it helped Netflix, you know, and other companies and producers understand what we wanted to do with the show.

Ross Duffer: To us, actually, this stuff — it didn't feel like this hodgepodge. It all felt like a whole when we all put it together and we put the music over it. And I think the reason is that the Stephen King stuff, the John Carpenter stuff, the Spielberg stuff is all just about these small towns and these very ordinary people. And so when we actually put it together and the music gave it this sort of slightly edgier tone than, you know, than the John Williams music, it sort of tied all these ideas together. And ... that was a relief to us because we realized that this thing might work.

On recreating 1983 for the camera

Listen to an extended interview with the creators of 'Stranger Things' Listen · 13:17 13:17

Ross: We were just trying to find people that wanted to achieve the same feeling that we did. And the minute that [production designer] Chris Trujillo, you know, his look book for us ... the reason we loved what he sent is that to us there felt something very real and very tangible about the worlds that he wanted to create. ... It's less about, you know, Cabbage Patch Kids and more about the wood paneled walls. ... So that's that stuff that instantly brings me back. Or even the little thing like the rainbow blinds in Mike's room, just something very simple like that that when I see [it] that I instantly feel like I'm sort of transported back in time.

On casting Winona Ryder in the role of Joyce Byers, the mother of the boy who disappears in the show's first episode

Matt: Our casting director, Carmen Cuba, it was her very first idea for any role in the show. I just remember getting an email: ""Hey, what about Winona Ryder?"" And so we were excited about it because you're looking for someone who you miss. And Winona is someone who we really missed. I mean, she hasn't been around that much for the past 10 years, but then she would pop up in things, and then you remember how much you miss her. And we figured that if we missed her this much, I bet a lot of other people miss her. You know, and then we sent her the script and amazingly she responded to it. It clicked really, really quickly with her. And, now, we cast her when we had just one script written, so at the time actually the Joyce character was a little different. I mean she was sort of this cursing, smoking, tough Long Island mom. So when we cast Winona, we did alter the character a little bit and I think Joyce became a lot more interesting because Winona has a very, you know, sort of specific energy about her.

On when they first realized the show had struck a chord with audiences

Matt: The first thing that really messed me up was Stephen King tweeted about it. And then I was like, ""What?"" No one else had tweeted really at that point and he obviously is one of our idols and was such a big inspiration for us and an influence on the show. That sort of messed me up. You just don't think about it reaching those people. So there was that and then it was the day after the show premiered and just going onto Twitter ... and yeah it was insane.

Ross: I mean, even starting Friday morning, you know, because the thing is released at midnight, so many people had already finished and were tweeting all these great things about it. It's interesting how it sort of snowballs and it keeps growing and growing.

And the way Netflix works, which is interesting, is that they don't need to do a ton of marketing up front. They don't need to create a lot of awareness until it's on the show, because when someone sees an advertisement for Stranger Things they want them to be able to go in the service and watch it. There's no benefit to them to have a big opening weekend. That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter when people watch it as long as they watch it and enjoy it. So it was interesting to see that it would just, through word of mouth, it just started to grow more and more and more. And so even on twitter what starts as a, you know, a few tweets turns into more and more and more and it just kept growing. And then you start seeing all this fan art, amazing fan art, and that's when we started realizing that ... this was becoming something.

On why they think people love Barb so much, even though she only has about 25 lines in the show

Ross: For us it's easy to relate to her because high school was terrible for us and I know it was for a lot of people. You either love it or hate it, and we hated it. And so I think there's a lot of people that feel like they were on the outside looking in, like Barb. All I know is it was very easy for us to write the Barb character and I think that, you know, Shannon Purser — who had never acted before — just did such a brilliant job realizing her. And, again, without very many lines — 25 lines. And I think everyone feels like either they knew this girl or they were this girl.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Curtis Baker/Netflix Curtis Baker/Netflix

Matt: I think the other reason people really connect to her is because ... I just think no one casts anyone like her. And that was something important to us and important to [casting director Carmen Cuba] was that we're casting kids and teens who feel very real. ... She looks like someone you might really go to school with. ...

Ross: Our teens have like acne. ... I'm glad we didn't, you know, cover it up.

Matt: Then there's been a push to like, ""Oh, let's clean them up. Let's have them go to a dermatologist."" It's like, no! Because the kids in [Stranger Things], they can't afford to go see a dermatologist on a weekly basis. ...

Ross: Nowadays you can digitally fix all those flaws. But to me it's important to try to keep that and make it feel as real as possible.

Matt: And I think that's helped the show.

On how much of the show is a reflection of their own childhoods

Ross: We weren't playing much Dungeons and Dragons, we were mostly playing Magic the Gathering, but very similar. And we would go out in the woods and you felt like you were on these adventures. So that was all very much we're just ripping from our childhood there. ...

Matt: We grew up in Durham, N.C., ... and we actually are shooting in Atlanta, Ga., so it looks very much like North Carolina, very much like the neighborhood we grew up in. We weren't monster hunting, but we were mostly going off and making movies with, you know, a very small group of nerdy friends. Not a lot of people wanted to be making movies with us.

On Millie Bobby Brown's performance as Eleven

... you know, Millie, it's almost freaky how good she is.

Ross: The thing about Millie and what makes her so incredible is most child actors, even the good ones – even, we're talking, like top 1 percent or top 0.5 percent, like the best of the best — what they're still not great at is listening. Because that's a very difficult thing, to stay engaged in a scene when it's not your line, because a lot of child actors are just waiting for the next line. And obviously that does not work with Eleven because this is a girl ... who doesn't have, she has no lines, and so all of it has to come off of reaction. So to find someone that is able to convey that sense of character and really to be talking without talking, that's a hard enough thing for an adult actor to do, a trained adult actor. But for someone who's, you know, 11 years old is just — you know, Millie, it's almost freaky how good she is. ...

I remember when Shawn Levy was directing his mind was blown because she went up to him and was like, ""Can I do another take?"" No other kids are doing that. And then you're like, ""OK, but the last two were great."" And she's like, ""No, let me do one more."" ... And then she does one more and she just takes it to another level. And that's something that, yes, I might expect from David Harbour, who's been acting his whole life, or Winona Ryder, but for that to come from this 11-year-old girl is truly incredible.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Netflix Courtesy of Netflix

Matt: Well, I mean, it's funny because with the adult actors you're basically hiring these people, they're better at what they do than you are. So you put a lot of trust into them. You know, for someone like David, who's as experienced as he is, we're relying on him a lot because you're shooting a lot. So you go up to him and you ask him what he wants to do. He's got ideas, you know, his instinct is just absolutely incredible, so you're relying on him a lot, you're putting a lot of trust in him to make really interesting creative decisions. And then what was interesting was by the end of the shoot, without me even realizing, I was treating Millie the same way. This is an 11-year-old girl, I'm going up to her and going, ""How do you feel? What do you want to be doing?"" Like, I was treating her like she was a 41-year-old Shakespearean actor.

Ross: And also because she's very — which is something else that most child actors don't have — she's very aware of the camera. So someone like Winona or David, they know how to play to the camera. They know when it's in close-up, they know when it's not. But most child actors, they're doing the same thing take after take after take. They're not adjusting their performance to lens or they're not adjusting it to camera position. But Millie absolutely is able to do that, which is another reason why she's so incredible and I think why she's able to communicate so much without saying very much.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Curtis Baker/Netflix Curtis Baker/Netflix

Matt: But at the same time she's a little girl, too, you forget. You know, like the kiss with Finn [Wolfhard], who plays Mike, you know, there was a two-month buildup to that about how disgusting it's going to be, about how horrible and why did you write this in? So yeah, she's still 11.

Ross: Or one day she showed up on set and she [was] just covered head to toe in glitter. And she's like, ""I don't know where this glitter came from."" And it's like I'm not having this problem with any of my adult actors. David Harbour is not coming in covered in glitter.

Matt: That was a 45 minute delay.

Ross: I don't know if you've tried to get glitter off someone but it's very difficult. So yeah, we fell behind.

On the Department of Energy's reaction to being cast as a villain in the show

Matt: I love that the Department of Energy issued a public statement that they're not evil. That's my favorite thing.

Ross: Out of thousands of scientists, none of them are evil.

Matt: I bet there's one evil one.

Ross: Someone in there is evil. Of a thousand people, someone's not a good guy. ...

Matt: I love how they pretend [in the statement] like they know how an interdimensional monster works. Like, I love that they're claiming that it couldn't be affecting the electricity in our world. That it wouldn't be messing with the electromagnetic field. Like, what do they know? How do they know that? That's interesting."

There was perhaps no movie more buzzed-about coming out of the Sundance Film Festival in January than Nate Parker's directorial debut, The Birth of A Nation, a retelling of Nat Turner's 19th century rebellion of enslaved people in Virginia.

By the time the festival was over, Nation had netted an unheard-of $17.5 million distribution deal from Fox Searchlight Pictures. It was considered a frontrunner for a raft of major awards, and Parker, who had carved out a solid if largely below-the-radar career as an actor, seemed poised to become a filmmaker of serious consequence — one of a handful of black directors able to claim as much.

YouTube

But as the summer wore on, and as Parker's stature grew, more people began paying attention to his past. During his days as a college wrestler at Penn State, Parker and his friend, Jean Celestin — who shares a writing credit on Nation — were each charged with raping a fellow student.

The Atlantic's Gillian White sketches out the broad, unsettling details of the case:

Court records show that in 1999, Parker and Celestin were accused of having sex with the woman while she was intoxicated and unconscious, and then harassing and intimidating her after she reported them to the college. ...Although Parker was cleared of assault in a court of law, the case endured after 2001, when he was acquitted and Celestin was found guilty of sexual assault; and after 2005, when Celestin won his appeal because the victim couldn't bring herself to testify again. It endured through 2012, when—as both the public and Parker found out this week—the woman killed herself, and it endures now because of Parker and Celestin's movie being widely heralded as a groundbreaking work of historical and racial significance.

Parker initially addressed the fresh attention to the rape trial this summer with language that was seen by many as tone-deaf and self-centered. ""Seventeen years ago, I experienced a very painful moment in my life,"" he told Variety. ""It resulted in it being litigated. I was cleared of it. That's that.""

Those comments came in for more criticism after the brother of the victim told Variety in August that his sister committed suicide in 2012.

Parker attempted to respond again with more empathy for the victim, but the controversy changed the tenor of the conversation around Nation, a film whose performance and reception Parker had been eager to render in stark, moral terms. ""If this film wins awards, but people see the film and behaviors don't change, than we have lost,"" he told an audience earlier this summer. ""This must not be a film that comes and goes.""

As many have pointed out, the fact of Parker's acquittal doesn't necessarily absolve him the way he and his supporters might like, especially at a time when black folks in particular are fighting to draw attention to serious flaws in the criminal justice system. Parker's film also includes a graphic gang rape scene, further complicating age-old questions about the ethics of consuming art when the artist is accused of terrible things.

On this week's episode of the Code Switch podcast, Karen Grigsby Bates sits down with Michael Arceneaux of Complex, Goldie Taylor of the Daily Beast, and The Atlantic's Gillian White to dig into some questions that often haunt controversial cultural object.

Is it possible to untether art from the person who created it? What obligations, if any, do filmgoers have to the people who may have been harmed by a filmmaker? And what ramifications might withholding support for Nation have for other black filmmakers struggling to find financing?

You can check out their discussion on NPR's podcast directory, and on iTunes and other places podcasts are found."

In the blink of a few thousand likes and shares, Texas teacher Brandy Young's homework policy gained the viral notoriety normally reserved for tip-shaming.

Earlier this month, Young informed parents of her Godley Elementary second-graders of her policy for the year: no homework.

""After much research this summer, I am trying something new,"" read a note. ""I ask that you spend your evenings doing things that are proven to correlate with student success. Eat dinner as a family, read together, play outside, and get your children to bed early.""

A parent of one of her students posted the note to Facebook with the comment: ""Brooke is loving her new teacher already!""

Novelty aside, Young's note echoes recent decisions by schools on their homework policies.

In Maryland, Baltimore County schools removed homework and conduct from its criteria for overall grades.

""Homework assignments provide students with an additional opportunity to practice, deepen their understanding, and/or increase progress toward meeting standards and expectations. ... [T]he results from homework should be used to provide feedback, and the scores should be entered as a nongraded assignment ..."" reads a report published by the school district.

And Homedale Elementary in southwest Idaho went a step further, instituting a schoolwide ban, reports KTVB.

""When the kids go home I want them to play, and create and use their imaginations and spend time with family,"" said Principal Terri Vasquez to the station.

Parents at the school expressed relief at the policy, KTVB goes on to report, with one parent telling the station her oldest son had up to an hour of homework every night while in first grade.

""We're in tons of extracurricular activities so it was a constant locking of horns as soon as he got home: 'Hurry up, do your homework, eat your dinner, you know?' "" said Tarah Uranga.

National Education Association standards suggest limiting the after-class workload to 10-20 minutes a night for first-graders, and adding 10 minutes for each grade after that. As NPR's Cory Turner reported last year, those standards are mostly adhered to:

""The best answer comes from something called the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. In 2012, students in three different age groups — 9, 13 and 17 — were asked, 'How much time did you spend on homework yesterday?' The vast majority of 9-year-olds (79 percent) and 13-year-olds (65 percent) and still a majority of 17-year-olds (53 percent) all reported doing an hour or less of homework the day before. ""Another study from the National Center for Education Statistics found that high school students who reported doing homework outside of school did, on average, about seven hours a week. ... ""In that 2012 NAEP survey, 13 percent of 17-year-olds reported doing more than two hours of homework the previous night. That's not a lot of students, but they're clearly doing a lot of work.""

Cory adds: ""The fact is, some students do have a ton of homework. In high school we see a kind of student divergence — between those who choose or find themselves tracked into less-rigorous coursework and those who enroll in honors classes or multiple Advanced Placement courses."""

The Ubiquitous EpiPen

EpiPens are in your friend's purse and your kid's backpack. The school nurse has a few, as does Grandma.

The medicine inside — epinephrine — has been around forever, and the handy gadget that injects it into your leg is not particularly new either.

So members of Congress, responding to their angry constituents, want to know why the price of the EpiPen, which can reverse a life-threatening allergic reaction, has risen about fivefold in the past decade.

The wholesale price of a single pen was about $47 in 2007, and it rose to $284 this summer, according to Richard Evans, a health care analyst at SSR. But consumers can no longer buy a single pen, so the retail price to fill a prescription today at Walgreens is about $633, according to GoodRX.

It's the latest in a string of controversies over rising drug prices that have caught the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. At least three senators have called for investigations into the price of the EpiPen, and Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have sent letters to Mylan, the drug's manufacturer, demanding an explanation for the increase.

Blumenthal went a step further. ""I demand that Mylan take immediate action to lower the price of EpiPens for all Americans that rely on this product for their health and safety,"" he wrote in a letter to the company.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Mylan has violated antitrust laws in its marketing of the EpiPen.

And Hillary Clinton weighed in, calling the price increases ""outrageous.""

""It's wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them,"" the Democratic presidential nominee said in a statement on her Facebook page.

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an email, ""We have reached out to every member of Congress who has sent us a letter, and we look forward to meeting with them and responding to their questions as soon as possible.""

She did not immediately comment on Clinton's statement.

The EpiPen is a long, plastic tube that automatically injects a dose of epinephrine — or adrenaline — into a person's thigh to stop an allergic reaction. It's easy to use and portable.

Mylan bought rights to the EpiPen in 2008 and launched an aggressive marketing and awareness campaign. That effort has made the so-called auto-injector a must-have for anyone with an allergy — perhaps to bee stings or tree nuts — that may trigger anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction in which the airwaves swell and close.

According to an account by Bloomberg Businessweek, the company considered selling off rights to the drug, which is an old product, but instead launched a campaign to boost sales. Revenue rose from $200 million to more than $1 billion a year.

The company itself touts its campaign ""for increased anaphylaxis awareness"" as what has helped drive prescriptions and sales of the device.

""Ensuring access to epinephrine — the only first-line treatment for anaphylaxis — is a core part of our mission,"" Mylan said in a press release this week.

And certainly people with life-threatening allergies are better off with easy access to the drug.

But Mylan is better off too.

That's because each EpiPen prescription creates a win-win sales cycle for Mylan.

An EpiPen prescription actually includes two injectors. The FDA in 2010 recommended that patients have access to two, in case the first doesn't work, and Mylan complied by taking its single EpiPens off the market and offering them in two-packs.

But often one prescription is not enough. People want the pens at home, in their offices or schools, perhaps in the car. So they might buy three or more two-pen packs. Schools and businesses also often keep them on hand in case a student or customer has an unexpected reaction.

That's a lot of EpiPens.

Plus, epinephrine has a short shelf life, so people have to replace their EpiPens each year, even if they've never used them.

That's how the drug has become a cash cow for Mylan, which last year moved its headquarters from the U.S. to the Netherlands.

But consumers are fed up. Almost 90,000 people signed a petition to Congress asking for an investigation. About 40,000 of those signatures came in on Wednesday.

Mylan says it is working to keep the medication cheap for consumers, by offering $100 coupons to offset high insurance copayments. In a statement released Monday, the company said about 80 percent of patients with insurance get the EpiPen free.

The statement didn't mention the retail price or the price increases at all. Instead, the company focused on insurance policies with high deductibles that shift costs to patients.

""We encourage all patients and families to thoroughly review and understand their healthcare insurance coverage,"" the statement said.

EpiPen's name recognition means doctors who want to prescribe adrenaline to an allergy-prone patient usually just turn to it. There is no specific EpiPen generic, so pharmacists can't substitute a cheaper alternative.

But that alternative does exist. Another auto-injector known as Adrenaclick is available in generic form at Wal-Mart for $141, according to GoodRX.

It's unclear how far the threats of a congressional investigation into the EpiPen will go.

But the prospect does present one awkward situation. The CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. In the time that the price of the EpiPen has been skyrocketing, so has Bresch's compensation. Last year, she earned about $18.2 million, according to the New York Times. That's up from about $2.5 million in 2007.

In earlier investigations into drug prices, the chiefs of many companies have been grilled and lectured harshly by lawmakers. It's unclear whether the angry senators will be as inclined to be as aggressive with the daughter of one of their colleagues."

Canada's national police force says it is allowing women in its ranks to wear the hijab.

A spokesman confirmed Wednesday that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, known as the Mounties, recently approved the headscarf for its Muslim officers.

""This is intended to better reflect the diversity in our communities and encourage more Muslim women to consider the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as a career option,"" Scott Bardsley, spokesman for Canada's public safety minister, told the Canada-based Global News.

Bardsley said other police forces in Canada have made similar religious accommodations, as have countries such as the U.S., U.K., Sweden and Norway.

Here's more from Global News:

""Three types of hijabs were tested last month before one was approved, according to an internal memo between Goodale and RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, obtained by Montreal's La Presse. The memo also said the hijab could be removed quickly if needed, and did not pose a risk to officers.""

The Mounties, easily recognized by their scarlet jackets and wide-brim hats, trace their history — and uniform — to the late 1800s, when recruits formed the North-West Mounted Police and headed west to stop an illegal American whiskey trade.

Women were allowed to join as uniformed members in 1974. And an RCMP assessment of gender in 2012 found that women represented 20 percent of the force's 19,258 regular members.

LePresse reports that the RCMP has received some 30 requests for cultural or religious accommodations over the past two years — mostly from male officers wanting to grow beards.

The hijab is not the first religious or cultural garment approved for RCMP officers. In 1990, Global News writes, ""the RCMP made the controversial decision to allow Sikh officers to wear turbans as part of their uniforms.""

In the U.S., the Defense Department relaxed rules to allow case-by-case religious exceptions for military dress in 2014, as The Two-Way reported at the time."

A magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck central Italy early Wednesday morning. It set off tremors in Rome nearly 100 miles away. David Greene talks to Nicole Winfield, an AP correspondent in Rome.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

The sun rose in central Italy this morning to reveal piles of rubble in small mountain villages. A 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit at about 3:30 a.m. local time. At least 37 people are reported killed, and an untold number are said to be still missing. We reached one eyewitness shortly after the quake. Andrew Willmot (ph) was at his vacation home about 30 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake.

ANDREW WILLMOT: We were woken at 3:30 in the morning. It took about a second to figure out what was happening. And the first floor was being tossed to one side by a displacement of about three or four inches. It brought the contents of shelves onto the floor. Glasses was smashed. The ceiling partially came down.

GREENE: And to talk more about this, let's bring in Nicole Winfield of the Associated Press. She's on the line from the AP's bureau in Rome. Nicole, good morning.

NICOLE WINFIELD: Good morning.

GREENE: So where exactly was the epicenter of this earthquake? Kind of give us the geography here if you can.

WINFIELD: The epicenter is around Norcia and Accumoli, which are about 150 kilometers northeast of Rome. It was felt, though, in the capital and as far east as the Adriatic.

GREENE: So you felt it in Rome this morning?

WINFIELD: Yes, it woke me up. We felt the room swaying. It was very slow and gentle, but we knew immediately that it was - that it was a quake. We felt them before, and it was long and very obvious.

GREENE: And what reports of damage and deaths and injuries are you getting at this point?

WINFIELD: Well, the Civil Protection Agency has, as you've said, confirmed 37 dead as a preliminary toll. The reports of damage there are enormous. You see images of entire towns that have just been completely razed. These are old towns where the buildings are old, and they're just crumbled under - under the shock of this quake. There's no estimate yet financially, but there are three towns that are known to be quite hard-hit, and rescue crews are still trying to get through to people who are believed to be trapped under the debris.

GREENE: You say rescue crews trying to get there. I mean, these are - these are pretty small, isolated places in the mountains of the central part of the country. Have they been known to be vulnerable to earthquakes? Were people ready for something like this to happen?

WINFIELD: This is a very seismic area. These are the Apennine Mountains, and they get - they get hit by quakes. We had a big one in 2009, and no one was expecting it.

GREENE: OK, we'll be following this story throughout the day. Again, a 6.2-magnitude earthquake hit in central Italy. Nicole Winfield on the line with us from the Associated Press in Rome. Thanks very much.

WINFIELD: Thank you.

YouTube

Computers have already beaten us at chess, Jeopardy and Go, the ancient board game from Asia. And now, in the raging war with machines, human beings have lost yet another battle — over typing.

Turns out voice recognition software has improved to the point where it is significantly faster and more accurate at producing text on a mobile device than we are at typing on its keyboard. That's according to a new study by Stanford University, the University of Washington and Baidu, the Chinese Internet giant. The study ran tests in English and Mandarin Chinese.

Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng says this should not feel like defeat. ""Humanity was never designed to communicate by using our fingers to poke at a tiny little keyboard on a mobile phone. Speech has always been a much more natural way for humans to communicate with each other,"" he says.

Researchers set up a competition, pitting a Baidu program called Deep Speech 2 against 32 humans, ages 19 to 32. The humans took turns saying and then typing short phrases into an iPhone — like ""buckle up for safety"" and ""wear a crown with many jewels"" and ""this person is a disaster."" They found the voice recognition software was three times faster.

Stanford computer scientist James Landay did not expect that. ""The surprise for me was that it was that much better: three times faster! You would think everyone would be flocking to use it if they knew how much better it actually was.""

Voice recognition still gets a bad rap. That could be because of how people use it. Apple's Siri, the beloved and befuddled personal assistant, has a hard time answering basic questions.

The Stanford University-University of Washington-Baidu team didn't test query skills. They zoomed in on voice recognition software's ability to type the spoken words. In English, they found the software's error rate was 20.4 percent lower than humans typing on a keyboard; and in Mandarin Chinese, it was 63.4 percent lower.

Landay hopes these findings encourage people to revisit the idea of talking to their phone.

""People probably play with Siri and find oh, it didn't give them the right answer. So they don't think to use speech as a way to do their text messaging or their email or what not,"" he says. ""Using speech for those things is now working really well.""

Back in the 1990s, researchers found voice recognition tools were far less accurate than keyboard typing. Slang and ambient noise in a room tripped up the software.

In the last few years, that's changed for a few reasons: Just like smartphone cameras with more megapixels can see us better, the built-in microphones can hear us better. Supercomputers are churning through data more effectively in a process called ""deep learning.""

And there's more training data to vacuum in and learn from. For example, Ng says, Baidu has five years' worth of audio — unique recordings of people speaking that can play nonstop from now until 2021.

Last year, 65 percent of smartphone owners in the U.S. used voice assistants, according to the 2016 Internet Trends Report, a popular annual overview by tech investor Mary Meeker.

Many tech companies are betting that now is the inflection point and are hiring experts in the field of ""natural language processing."" Google and Amazon are inviting developers to work on voice-driven products.

It's easy to see how talking at your device would be far better than typing, say when you're driving.

Baidu's Ng imagines another scenario. He does not have children yet. But, he says, he looks forward to the day when his future grandchild comes home and asks, ""Is it really true that when you were young, if you came home and you said something to your microwave oven — did it really just sit there and ignore you? That's just so rude of the microwave.""

His co-author Landay reins him back and notes there are many moments — in a meeting, in bed with your partner sleeping — when typing still makes more sense than talking to one's devices."

Enlarge this image toggle caption DigitalGlobe/Getty Images DigitalGlobe/Getty Images

Australia has a controversial policy of intercepting refugees and migrants at sea and sending them to detention centers, paid for by Australia, in remote island nations. One of those centers is on Nauru, a tiny speck in the Pacific Ocean with just 10,000 citizens.

The refugees and migrants come from many troubled countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, and some of them, including children, have complained of abuse at the Australian camp on Nauru.

Australia's immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has played down these allegations, claiming most are about small issues, and reiterating that the asylum seekers will not be allowed to come to Australia. He argues that such a move would give ""smugglers a green light.""

Nauru The tiny island nation is just eight square miles and has just 10,000 citizens.

But Viktoria Vibhakar, a former aid worker for Save The Children Australia, says abuse is a serious problem at the detention camp and has been largely ignored. She was hired to work in Nauru in 2013, and spent a year coming and going to the island.

""One of the first things I got, which was the most striking, was a deed of confidentiality, which was a couple pages and it basically said, you cannot say anything about what goes on in this facility and if you do, you are liable for two years in jail for each disclosure.""

Vibhakar spoke by Skype with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep.

""In the beginning we'd go out to the detention facility, which is basically a place of barren rock, phosphate rock, with jagged pinnacles with little natural vegetation and very bright light because the glare of the sun is incredibly oppressive,"" she said. ""The asylum seekers were housed in vinyl tents, and we would go and meet with them and ask them how they were doing, and Steve, as time went on I felt like my job was just convincing people to stay alive.""

What was the first case that came to your attention that made you think something is seriously wrong here?

""Three days into my first rotation on Nauru there was an adolescent boy who had been sexually assaulted. The child was living in fear of this sexual assault being repeated not just to him but to his mother who was living without a partner in the detention facility.""

Who was the alleged abuser, according to the victims?

""So it was an employee who was a cleaner. And he actually admitted to the sexual assault, and while the security guards were making note of the sexual assault and taking the boy's report, the person who sexually assaulted the young boy continued to mock him. And see there was a complete lack of privacy in this detention facility, so here is a boy having to report a sexual assault and he is doing it in the open air, in front of guards, while the abuser is standing there mocking him. And see what was really amazing to me is here was a Save the Children manager there and she told me at the time that this person was going to be moved to a different detention facility within Nauru but that he wasn't going to be fired. And she said this just as a matter of, this was just normal, you have to accept it, this is just the way it is.""

[Vibhakar went on to say the employee was eventually fired.]

What were you supposed to do when you were told of abuse?

""We were supposed to fill out an incident report immediately, but see, there was no child protection agency in Nauru so there was no statutory protection function. And the biggest issue about children and their safety was that we were never allowed to remove them from harm. So the Australian government never gave Save the Children the authority to remove children if they felt that they were unsafe. Reporting abuse is not adequate if the child is still subjected to further abuse. But this was the case in Nauru.""

Did anyone have the authority to remove a child from harm?

""Only the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of the government Australia and they refused.""

Did they have people there?

""Yes, they did but they interacted almost very rarely with asylum seekers and they refused to remove children.""

What did you do when it became apparent, in your view, that there was widespread abuse and that nobody was doing anything about it?

""So there was an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into children and immigration detention which is the human rights government agency in Australia. They had called this inquiry and after reviewing the information that my organization had provided voluntarily to this inquiry, I found that it lacked very important details, namely they failed to disclose the physical and sexual assault of children and the lack of safety of children.""

So Save the Children Australia was questioned by this inquiry and didn't pass on information so far as you could tell, that you knew?

""Yes. That's correct.""

So what did you do?

""I chose to make a report, an anonymous report to the [Australian] Human Rights Commission detailing the abuse and systemic violations of human right to children and families on Nauru and I attached several thousand pages of documentation as well and I sent it to the commission.""

How physically did you send those several thousand documents?

""I did it by mail ... I wore a baseball cap and wore sunglasses and went to a post office farther from my house and paid cash because I was so scared of the Australian government.""

So did you have a moment as that package went through the slot, well, that's two years in jail?

""I had many of those moments. Because it's, each disclosure is two years in jail so I had many, many of those scary moments and, of course, I was eventually referred to the Australian federal police with nine other of my colleagues.""

Her documents are among many that have now been leaked about the abuse of refugees on the island of Nauru. As it happened, the Australian police never came for Vibhakar. But she did lose her job with Save the Children. That organization said Australia only let it serve the refugees, if it kept its work confidential. What, if anything, has changed for the better?

""Well I have to be honest, in Nauru, it's only gotten worse. Their mental health has deteriorated and hopelessness and the despair has increased. The this is undisputed by the Australian government. They know that this is causing harm."""

Gunmen attacked the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul on Wednesday evening, as students and staff hunkered down in place or fled for their lives, witnesses say.

Hospital officials say at least one student was killed and at least 14 injured, as Jennifer Glasse, reporting from Kabul, tells our Newscast unit.

""Right now there are dozens of Afghan police, security forces, special forces. They've surrounded the campus,"" Glasse says. Here's more:

""The explosion went off at about 7 o'clock here and a number of attackers got into the campus of the American University, where students were in the middle of evening classes. So dozens if not hundreds of students are inside the university and a number of the buildings there. We've heard some gunfire — it's been fairly quiet but a few sporadic bursts of gunfire and shots.""

Afghan security forces have been combing the university grounds in search of the perpetrators and any students still hiding, Glasse reports.

The president of the university, Mark English, had told The Associated Press that a militant attack was underway. He said they ""are trying to assess the situation.""

It's still unclear exactly how many attackers participated and whether they belong to a specific militant group. As Glasse reports, police say at least three gunmen were involved.

Student Freshta Ibrahimi tells NPR that she was eating dinner with friends on campus when explosions and gunfire rang out. They started running toward the emergency door to try to get to the street.

""When we were running ... we were hearing the fire of guns again and everybody was shouting 'Let's run, run! They're in the campus and they're firing!' "" Ibrahimi says. ""I myself started crying when I heard the gunfire and how it was close to me."" She says she eventually made it out to safety. After her group ran to a main street away from the campus, ""I couldn't stand on my feet and I couldn't breathe,"" she said.

Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Massoud Hossaini tweeted that he was stuck on campus and heard gunshots and explosions, noting ""this maybe my last tweets.""

But he escaped. He spoke with the AP about the harrowing experience, saying he was in a classroom with 15 students when he heard an explosion:

"" 'I went to the window to see what was going on, and I saw a person in normal clothes outside. He shot at me and shattered the glass,' Hossaini said, adding that he fell on the glass and cut his hands. ""The students then barricaded themselves into the classroom, pushing chairs and desks against the door, and staying on the floor.

Hossaini and about nine students managed to escape from the campus through a northern emergency gate. "" 'As we were running I saw someone lying on the ground face down, they looked like they had been shot in the back,' he said.""

The attack comes just a few weeks after two foreign professors were kidnapped at gunpoint near the school. They have not been located.

In 2014, two employees of the American University of Afghanistan were killed in an attack on a Kabul restaurant. The deaths shook a school that had been largely insulated from violence.

""From behind its fortified walls, the university has operated relatively unscathed since it opened in 2006,"" NPR's Jacki Lyden noted at the time. ""It's benefited from a huge infusion of cash from the United States, which sees the campus as an incubator of talent and entrepreneurship.""

This is a developing story. Some things that get reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops."

The Bombay to Barcelona Library Cafe sits on one side of a noisy street in a lower-middle-class neighborhood of Mumbai, India, not far from the city's swanky new international airport.

Wedged in a block with a clinic and a hardware store, this modest-sized cafe has only four tables. There's an open kitchen with bar stools at the counter and a small library at the back, with books donated by patrons. The walls are orange, and some repurposed aluminum kettle lamps and tea glass lamp shades give the room a warm and earthy tone. Outside, there's a little patio with a couple of benches, and a bright green awning that stands out against the gloomy gray of the concrete structures around it.

This ordinary-looking cafe is on an extraordinary mission — to be inclusive. In a country where cafes are used exclusively by the growing middle class, this cafe has opened its doors to people from all walks of life — from cab and rickshaw drivers and street kids to the average office worker. Anyone who can't afford a $2 cup of coffee, often the cheapest item in an average Indian cafe, can find something tasty and affordable here.

A cup of tea on the patio costs only 10 rupees (15 U.S. cents), the same as at any roadside tea stall. The rest of the menu is limited but wholesome: sandwiches, quiche, tortillas, tapas. There is also dessert, bonbons and coffees.

The cafe is a labor of love for proprietor Amin Sheikh, who spent his early childhood on the streets of Mumbai, where food was key to survival but hard to come by. The cafe's servers are also former street children.

The son of a domestic worker, Sheikh was 5 years old when he ran away from home and his job at a tea shop. For three years, he scavenged for scraps in garbage bins and begged for food or money in trains and stations. He eventually found his way to an orphanage called Snehasadan, where meals were regular but basic, and the best dessert was ""whatever candy cost the least"" in stores outside, he recalls.

Today, Sheikh is also a book author and a successful tour operator, but success didn't come easily. He dropped out after seventh grade and learned to drive, eventually finding employment as the chauffeur and Man Friday of a well-to-do man.

""When I was a driver, I never had money to have a coffee at one of the [Indian] cafes,"" he says. ""In that much money, I could get a full chicken meal and a tea. I don't understand why a cup of coffee is that expensive — has it got gold in it? Has it come from the moon? Everyone deserves to go somewhere nice.""

In 2002, he bought his own car and started giving guided tours of the city. The next year, he had the opportunity to visit clients and friends in Spain and saw a different world. ""In Spain, I saw everyone has the same coffee at the same coffee shop and it costs them all the same,"" he says. ""With one euro, a shoeshine boy or a manager can have the very best coffee. Nobody told me you cannot sit here, go somewhere else."" It was a revelation.

Because Indian society is much more stratified and class-conscious. ""If I had gone to a coffee shop, this is how high society would think: 'What is this bloody driver doing here?'"" says Sheikh. ""But this bloody driver is also human.""

He decided to create a place for drivers like him and other ordinary people. ""Why not a basic place for basic people? Without spelling it out, you can give someone dignity without preaching about it."" And he realized he could close the loop by employing kids from his orphanage.

For seven years, Sheikh put aside money, even writing and publishing an autobiography in 2012. Twelve thousand copies and eight language editions later he says, ""Whatever money I made from selling my book at churches, traffic signals, talks has gone into this café.""

Affordability and dignity aren't Sheikh's only goals. Quality is high on his agenda, too.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Bombay to Barcelona Library Cafe Courtesy of Bombay to Barcelona Library Cafe

""I could use crap ingredients, I could parcel out diabetes and heart disease without a problem, but I want quality,"" Sheikh says. ""I want the ingredients to be nutritious.""

So instead of cutting corners and using the cheap, local hydrogenated baking chocolate, he's using Belgian chocolate from Europe. But he's working on sourcing other organic ingredients, including milk, locally.

And while he's at it, why not introduce his customers to some foreign foods, too? ""In Spain, everyone knows some Indian food,"" he says. ""Everybody knows chicken tikka, so why shouldn't kids here know tortillas and Spanish cookies?""

The cafe's cookies are divine — crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The recipe comes from Figueres, a small town in Catalonia, just outside Barcelona, Spain. A couple — Carlos and Maria Antonia Pereze, who run a restaurant — had read his book and they were moved by his story. When they contacted Sheikh and learned that he was ready to start his dream cafe, they took three weeks off to come help him start up.

The night I visited the cafe was the Perezes' last in town. Carlos was pulling a batch of cookies from the oven while overseeing the making of more batter. Maria Antonia was going over checklists at a table. Later that evening, after their last guests had finished their cake and left, the staff and volunteers gathered together. Over the four-way multi-lingual conversation — English, Catalan, Hindi (India's national language) and Marathi (Mumbai's local language) — there were last-minute instructions, reminders and hugs. The couple's affection for the cafe staff shone through.

Anil Kurup, the cafe's baker, is an alum of Snehasadan, the same orphanage that Sheikh grew up in. Trained in the bakery section of a big hotel chain on Sheikh's urging a few years ago, Kurup has now added tortillas and cookies to his repertoire under the Perezes' tutelage. ""When I was growing up, I never dreamed that I'd get to eat any of this, let alone make it,"" he says.

Business at the cafe is still picking up, but Sheikh is OK with that. He tells his staff that all good things take time.

""See, I don't want to be a business,"" Sheikh says. ""I want to get people to be human beings.""

Amir, 12, and his cousin Mehran, 11, live in the neighborhood and are on their fourth visit in three days. They sit on a bench on the patio, enjoying their Spanish hot chocolate, smacking their lips between sips.

""I like the experience,"" says Mehran. ""And the hot chocolate, the cookies, the books."" His cousin Amir is excited because ""Uncle (Sheikh) told us there will be comics and kids' books, too.""

The boys are delighted that there's a nice place they can afford. Their monthly allowance is about $11 each, but with a cup of hot chocolate priced at 60 cents, they can enjoy some of the treats here. They tell me they've peeped into fancy coffee shops before, but this is the first one they've been to. That access, and the contented smiles on their faces, is just what Sheikh is aiming for."

A strong quake struck central Italy Wednesday morning. Renee Montagne talks to Emma Tucker, deputy editor of The Times of London, who's in the quake zone. She was vacationing at the time of the quake.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

As we've been reporting, Italy is reeling from a 6.2 magnitude earthquake. It struck before dawn this morning local time. At least 38 people are reported killed. More are still missing.

The most devastated towns are in central Italy, about an hour's drive from Rome. One mayor told the Associated Press that his town, Amatrice, is half-gone and that people are still under the rubble.

We managed to reach Emma Tucker, the deputy editor of The Times of London, who's been staying in a vacation home about 50 miles from the earthquake's epicenter. She spoke to us via Skype.

Welcome to the program.

EMMA TUCKER: Hi.

MONTAGNE: Where are you now? Where are we speaking to you?

TUCKER: Well, I'm actually - we're in a farmhouse about 85 kilometers from the center of the earthquake in an area called Le Marche. We're near a little village - a little Italian hilltop village called Penna San Giovanni.

And I'm on the top floor of the house we were staying in, where the damage was worse, where we had sort of seven teenagers sleeping last night, all of whom woke up with plaster crashing all over them when the first tremor struck.

MONTAGNE: Now, you must yourself have been sleeping when the earthquake hit.

TUCKER: We're staying with friends who own this house. And we were all fast asleep. It was the middle of the night, 3:30 a.m. And the earthquake woke us up with an absolute - you know, very intense - the house started to shake. It got more and more intense.

And more than anything - I mean, obviously, the shaking of the house was terrifying - but the thing that I keep remembering was this terrible noise, this awful - you know, I was trying to describe it. It sounded like a train was heading towards the house and was about to run over it - sort of thunderous, clanking noise.

And it lasted - I mean, it was only a short quake. I'm told this is short. It was 20 seconds. But they felt very, very long - those 20 seconds - long enough for me to leap out of the house out of my bed, call the teenagers from upstairs.

We had seven teenagers sleeping above us. And we all ran out into the garden. After that, we sat around, you know, talked stories and then decided, you know, rather foolishly, in retrospect, to go back to bed. No sooner had we sat down again than there was this really scary aftershock, which was almost as bad as the initial quake.

And because we now were awake and knew what was happening, it was actually more terrifying. And at that point, we just abandoned ship and left the house and sat in the garden until the sun came up, at which point we were able to see how much damage had been done to the house, which was pretty extensive.

MONTAGNE: But you haven't decided to get out of the area altogether? Or are you not able to get out of the area altogether?

TUCKER: I think we were unlucky. I think where we are, there is damage. But it's nothing like the damage you're probably seeing on the television in the area worst affected, Amatrice. I mean, our house is badly damaged. But the whole area is kind of OK. The roads are all right. So what - we're going to stay put for now and just sort of play it a bit by ear.

MONTAGNE: Do you have any sense of what the nearby houses look like or the closest village?

TUCKER: We've been up to the village. It doesn't look too bad. The local - the builder who came around said a lot of the houses have got damage like ours, cracks in the external walls. But the roads are fine.

The real problem isn't really where we are, although a lot of houses have been affected. It's over towards the center of Italy, where the epicenter was, where, you know, there are these terrible reports of, you know, several - you know, lot of - quite a few deaths and people buried under rubble near the epicenter.

I think it's pretty awful there. I think around here, it's just a lot of inconvenience, damage to houses and interrupted holidays.

MONTAGNE: What's being reported is that people in Rome, which is...

TUCKER: Which is much further away than where we are. And if they were feeling it there, we were feeling it here. I can't imagine what it was like where it really struck hard.

MONTAGNE: Well, thank you very much for joining us.

TUCKER: My pleasure.

MONTAGNE: Emma Tucker is a journalist speaking to us from Italy, struck this morning by a 6.2 magnitude earthquake. We'll be tracking that story throughout the morning.

Nestled among rolling hills and grazing cows, Elmore Mountain Bread in central Vermont is quintessentially pastoral. The setting is apropos, given the owners' recent decision to start grinding their own flour by stone — a veritable step back in time.

Blair Marvin, who co-owns the bakery and mill with her husband, Andrew Heyn, says the motivation to build the mill came from a fellow baker in North Carolina, who sent them a surprise shipment of his own freshly milled flour about four years ago. Typically, flour has an almost dusty odor, but this flour smelled earthy, Marvin recalls. ""We were like, 'whoa, whoa, whoa!'""

The couple had been thinking a lot about what they were putting into their bread. They'd recently had a baby — Phineas — whose foray into solids involved a diet heavy in baguettes. The flour they were using was organic but industrially produced. That shipment made them realize, says Marvin, ""that we could control every step of the process"" and create a loaf that tasted as good as the flour they were smelling.

In building their own mill, the couple joined a growing movement among bakers, chefs and pasta makers to go back to using grains pulverized the old-fashioned way. Wheat ground through a stone mill not only tastes better, argue these converts, it's also more nutritious than conventionally milled flours. What's more, small-scale millers tend to buy grains from farmers in the area, which supports the locavore movement.

""The milling revolution,"" Marvin says, ""is happening right now.""

The stone mill at Elmore Mountain Bread, which is housed in a garage just off the bakery, is as tall as the ceiling and contains a giant funnel. The grain, fed through this funnel, spills onto two 700-pound, circular granite stones, which grind anything atop it into flour.

Stone milling this way crushes and combines the wheatberry's exterior bran, starchy endosperm and oily germ — the grain's nutritional powerhouse — to create flour rich in fiber and omega 3s. But the presence of germ also means that the resulting flour will perish within weeks.

Humans have milled with stones for millennia. But in the late 1880s, roller mills began to replace that older technology. Those industrial mills contained enormous spinning cylinders that sheared away the bran and germ, leaving only the endosperm — aka white flour.

White roller-milled flour was nonperishable, easy to use, and meshed with consumers' growing preference for lily white, ""pure"" foods, says Stephen Jones, director of the Bread Lab at Washington State University. Roller milling gradually centralized and homogenized the flour production process.

It also promoted the growth of ever larger wheat farms, which wiped out the smaller guys. But those farmers are staging a slow comeback.

Jones has been working with hundreds of farmers from Alaska to southern California to breed and grow different varieties of wheat. ""You can't just use any wheat,"" Jones says. ""You have to find the right variety.""

When a variety succeeds, the wheat is brought into a lab, where professional bakers try working with the product. Some wheat varieties end up being good for pizza dough or tortillas, while others are better suited for bread, Jones says. Other strains never make it past the testing stage.

Back in Vermont, Marvin found a local farmer who was growing a variety of wheat known as Redeemer. She bought his entire harvest, or about 12 tons of grain, to get started.

But worried that their new approach would alienate loyal customers, Marvin and Heyn decided to attach their mill to a sifter that could extract bran. Bread milled this way still contains the nutrient-rich germ and a bit more bran than white flour, but retains a more familiar taste and texture.

But this approach is controversial in the grain world. ""Some of these millers are recreating white flour by a different name,"" argues Jones, who sees a return to whole grain bread and pasta as the logical end product of stone-ground milling.

Nutritionally speaking, breads made with whole wheat flour are undoubtedly healthier than those made with white flour. But things get muddy when comparing, say, a loaf made at Elmore Mountain Bread versus a whole wheat loaf made from roller-milled flour that you might buy at the supermarket.

That ""whole wheat"" label at the supermarket can be misleading, because roller-milled whole wheat flour is typically made by first separating the endosperm, bran, and germ and then adding them all back together. According to Food and Drug Administration guidelines, flour can be called ""whole grain"" if only 51 percent of all those components are added back in. By contrast, the sifted flour at Elmore contains more than half the bran and all the germ. It's not clear how much bran and germ commercial bread producers are adding back in (it could be 51 percent, 100 percent, or somewhere in between), but it could be less than those components in flour milled at Elmore.

Moreover, the roller mill's separation step destroys many of the vitamins in the wheat layers, which remain better protected in the stone milling process.

What's needed is a way to compare the nutritional composition of flours across the spectrum, says Josey Baker, owner of The Mill in San Francisco. ""I want nutritional analyses of bread made with white flour, with sifted flour, with whole grain flour, with fresh whole grain flour.""

No matter how a baker with a mill sources their wheatberries and makes flour, making bread remains the hardest step.

Baker says his early attempts at using freshly milled flour weren't very successful. ""We had customers say, 'What happened to your bread?' ""

That's because milling in-house means that a baker must decide everything from how finely to grind the flour to how much water to add for the right consistency. Recipes must be tweaked from season to season to accommodate for different varieties of wheat.

Through a lot of trial and error, Baker says he finally re-learned how to bake a loaf with great flavor and texture.

Ironically, Marvin says she only realized the new setup was working after receiving a call from a disgruntled customer, who claimed the Country French bread was ""too wheaty.""

That the customer was complaining about the bread's central ingredient, Marvin says, ""was a backhanded compliment."" Sure enough, the gentleman came around to his new, wheatier loaf and remains a loyal customer. Other customers followed suit.

So, too, did bakers, who regularly frequent little Elmore to check out the mill for themselves. And then there's Phineas, today a 5-year-old bread connoisseur who can distinguish among all those varieties of bread even if he's still partial to the baguette.

Marvin says the milling experiment gives her hope that kids will grow up knowing that bread can be wholesome and tasty, that it's more than ""something that can be squished into a tiny ball and sit on the counter for months."""

Tropical Storm Colin ripped across the Gulf of Mexico in June and hit the coast of southwest Florida with 60-mile-an-hour winds. Before it arrived, a team from the U.S. Geological Survey used a new computer model to predict how far inland the waves would invade. When the storm hit, the USGS sent Joe Long out to film it.

Long is an oceanographer with the USGS. His video shows waves rushing up the beach to the foot of a sand dune. ""So water levels are reaching that high,"" he says as we watch the video. ""They are eroding the face of that dune and creating this pretty steep face.""

Just beyond the dunes, you can see a multistory condominium. ""If that dune wasn't there,"" Long explains, ""that water would be going onto roadways or hitting the base of those buildings.""

When Long goes to the beach, he sees stuff the rest of us don't pay much attention to. He gets excited about ""dune toes"" (the base of a dune) and ""scarp formation"" (the creation of a steep dune face). He says he bores his kids at the beach.

But that attention to beach sculpting by ocean waves has helped him design a computer model that predicts something called ""wave run-up."" During storms, wind pushes a mass of water up toward a beach. That's called surge. But on top of that surge, wind creates waves that reach even higher — wave run-up.

Tropical Storm Colin hits Treasure Island, Fla., at Sunset Beach on June 6. The rising sea level and increased wave run-up created a steep beach scarp.

If they're big enough, these waves destroy the dune and wash huge amounts of sand close to shore — or they may carry the sand out to sea. ""The model we use is trying to predict the type of coastal change that we would see during a storm,"" Long explains.

The model is fairly new, but it predicted the level of wave run-up during Colin to within about a foot. It also nailed the amount of erosion the dunes would suffer.

One reason the geological survey has spent years perfecting this model is that the ocean is moving in on us. A warming planet is causing sea levels to rise. ""More storms could impact these protective dunes because sea levels are higher,"" he says.

Our coastlines are increasingly threatened.

And the survey is trying to predict how and where. Florida is near the top of the list. At the survey's offices in St. Petersburg, I walk downstairs to a dimly lit basement lab to visit marine biologist Ilsa Kuffner. She's a coral reef expert.

Shelves are packed with chunks of coral Kuffner has collected. Her job is to find out what happens to waves before they get to the beaches. ""The main thrust of our project,"" she says, ""is looking at reefs being barriers that are protecting coastlines.""

Reefs slow down incoming swells and waves. The problem is that warmer ocean temperatures are killing a lot of coral, so coral beds shrink down, away from the sea surface. In effect, the water depth increases. ""So there's less drag,"" Kuffner says. ""More wave energy can propagate over the reef, so they're not performing as well as breakwaters.""

Then, when waves do reach the shore, their effects depend on a lot of things — how steep the beach is, for example, or how high the dunes are. The west coast of Florida, it turns out, isn't very sturdy. ""The Gulf is in a really bad state,"" says Hilary Stockdon, a USGS oceanographer and one of the designers of the model. She says beaches and dunes along the Gulf of Mexico are flat and low, and even a small hurricane would do a lot of damage.

""A direct landfall of a Category 1 [hurricane] almost anywhere in the Gulf of Mexico will cause significant coastal erosion,"" Stockdon says. That threatens wetlands and barrier islands, as well as roads and buildings.

The team's computer models factor in predictions about the rise in sea level and show lots of places along the East and the Gulf coasts that are increasingly threatened.

""Water is just going to start reaching places that it hasn't reached before,"" Stockdon says, ""and if they don't consider this wave run-up, they're going to miss this important part.""

""They"" are weather forecasters and emergency response teams from Maine to Mississippi. Stockdon says some are already using the model to prepare.

That makes Nathaniel Plant happy. Plant is the top USGS oceanographer on this project, and he says the goal is to help people prepare — to know where it's going to flood, and also where the waves can't be stopped.

""As a nation, we actually have to decide,"" Plant says: ""What areas are we going to invest in to protect? What areas are we going to let go on their own?""

In some places, he says, the waves are going to win.

Science reporters at NPR are exploring all sorts of waves this summer. Stay tuned for more more of our favorites."

Los Angeles musician Gabriel Reyes-Whittaker had a problem: A few years ago, he was asked to tackle the weighty subject of Latin American modernism in sound. His response was to invent a new persona, and to restrict himself to a spare and specific set of tools. Under the new name Frankie Reyes, he set off to record a dozen instrumental versions of Spanish-language ballads and waltzes from the 1930s through the '60s, using only a vintage analog synthesizer.

The resulting album, Boleros Valses y Mas, is a novelty record in the best sense of the term: making something new and unusual by mining older songs and technologies. If you're familiar with the original songs, you'll notice that Reyes isn't doing anything dramatic with his arrangements. The Oberheim synthesizer isn't even that old — it hit the market in the late '70s. But in using it to remake these standards from generations earlier, Reyes disrupts our sense of where, and especially when, these songs first came out.

YouTube

One of my favorite things about Boleros Valses y Mas is how every listen inspires new metaphors to try to describe it. So far, I've come up with: ""It's from an old Puerto Rican sci-fi movie soundtrack,"" or, ""It's what you'd hear during a graveyard carousel ride,"" or, ""It's what a band might play if your quinceañera happened to fall on the Day of the Dead."" And though those all work to a degree, the magic and mystery of Frankie Reyes's sound always feels just outside the realm of description, but well within that of imagination."

In the blink of a few thousand likes and shares, Texas teacher Brandy Young's homework policy gained the viral notoriety normally reserved for tip-shaming.

Earlier this month, Young informed parents of her Godley Elementary second-graders of her policy for the year: no homework.

""After much research this summer, I am trying something new,"" read a note. ""I ask that you spend your evenings doing things that are proven to correlate with student success. Eat dinner as a family, read together, play outside, and get your children to bed early.""

A parent of one of her students posted the note to Facebook with the comment: ""Brooke is loving her new teacher already!""

Novelty aside, Young's note echoes recent decisions by schools on their homework policies.

In Maryland, Baltimore County schools removed homework and conduct from its criteria for overall grades.

""Homework assignments provide students with an additional opportunity to practice, deepen their understanding, and/or increase progress toward meeting standards and expectations. ... [T]he results from homework should be used to provide feedback, and the scores should be entered as a nongraded assignment ..."" reads a report published by the school district.

And Homedale Elementary in southwest Idaho went a step further, instituting a schoolwide ban, reports KTVB.

""When the kids go home I want them to play, and create and use their imaginations and spend time with family,"" said Principal Terri Vasquez to the station.

Parents at the school expressed relief at the policy, KTVB goes on to report, with one parent telling the station her oldest son had up to an hour of homework every night while in first grade.

""We're in tons of extracurricular activities so it was a constant locking of horns as soon as he got home: 'Hurry up, do your homework, eat your dinner, you know?' "" said Tarah Uranga.

National Education Association standards suggest limiting the after-class workload to 10-20 minutes a night for first-graders, and adding 10 minutes for each grade after that. As NPR's Cory Turner reported last year, those standards are mostly adhered to:

""The best answer comes from something called the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. In 2012, students in three different age groups — 9, 13 and 17 — were asked, 'How much time did you spend on homework yesterday?' The vast majority of 9-year-olds (79 percent) and 13-year-olds (65 percent) and still a majority of 17-year-olds (53 percent) all reported doing an hour or less of homework the day before. ""Another study from the National Center for Education Statistics found that high school students who reported doing homework outside of school did, on average, about seven hours a week. ... ""In that 2012 NAEP survey, 13 percent of 17-year-olds reported doing more than two hours of homework the previous night. That's not a lot of students, but they're clearly doing a lot of work.""

Cory adds: ""The fact is, some students do have a ton of homework. In high school we see a kind of student divergence — between those who choose or find themselves tracked into less-rigorous coursework and those who enroll in honors classes or multiple Advanced Placement courses."""

For such a commonplace bodily function, the sneeze has messed with our minds (and noses) for centuries. It will kill us, it won't kill us. We'll have bad luck, we'll have good luck. Watch out for Satan, he's wily and knows how to get into your nasal membranes. Did you have too much to eat? Are you sad? Do you have a weak heart?

Technically, sneezing is a reflex to the usual irritants such as germs, dust or pollen. But it turns out your nose can get ruffled by some of the strangest things. One false move may trigger an epic sneezing fit, and the 1969 978-day record is ripe for the taking.

Let's look deeper into your nose and all of its mysteries, shall we?

Sneezing is bad for the soul.

In 1515, Leonardo da Vinci dissected a human brain in an effort to find the soul. Though his soulsearching came up empty, this did not stop people from believing that the soul lives inside the head – a concept widely held during that time. When someone sneezed, the soul was believed to have been thrown from the body, thereby leaving it open for invasion by evil spirits.

Sneezing is good for the soul.

The good news is that once invaded, the body would try to quickly force the spirit out; this is best accomplished, of course, by sneezing. No matter which way the spirits are moving, however, sneezes were thought to be a gateway to the supernatural.

If you say ""God Bless You,"" God might spare you. Or not.

The origin of this custom is varied, but one of the more prevalent theories is that during the 6th-century plague, which originated via disease-carrying mice in Egypt, Pope Gregory I urged divine intercession to help ward off illness. Because sneezing was one of the first signs of the deadly plague, he commanded people to say ""God Bless You"" after a sneeze. Even so, by the time the plague had run its course, it had killed half the population of Europe. Pope Gregory may have benefited from a backup plan.

Your heart stops or skips a beat when you sneeze.

It doesn't. However, the increase in pressure in the chest during the sneeze reduces blood flow into the heart from the veins, says Dr. Nancy Sweitzer, chief of cardiology at the University of Arizona's Sarver Heart Center. That leads to a weaker, less forceful beat, which can cause the sensation of a skipped beat.

""The heartbeat is determined by the electrical system of the heart, which is typically on autopilot and just keeps going,"" Sweitzer says. ""The electrical activity of the heart is constant through a sneeze, but the mechanical 'pumping' may be reduced in force, particularly during a forceful sneeze.""

The sneeze: once again proving that feelings are not facts.

Tweezing your eyebrows can make you sneeze.

Weird, but true. Those darn nasal nerves are so capricious. Even something as simple as plucking your eyebrows can irritate the nerve endings in your face, which in turn makes them fire a signal to hassle the nasal nerve. And when you irritate your nasal nerve, it irritates you right back – by making you sneeze.

""The eyebrows and the nose are both innervated by the same branch of the trigeminal nerve, which can be stimulated by tweezing the eyebrows,"" says Dr. Apple Bodemer, an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Wisconsin. ""The neuronal excitation from plucking can travel to the nose — resulting in a sneeze.""

But take heart! You can enlist your eyebrows to fight back. ""Putting pressure on the eyebrow while plucking can short circuit the response and block the sneeze,"" says Bodemer.

Sneezing always comes in threes.

First of all, if you sneeze three times it does not mean that someone is gossiping about you or that you're going to win the lottery. Save that stuff for the playground. Most people sneeze more than once because their first sneeze just didn't pack the punch needed to rid their nasal passages of all irritants. Whether that's three times or 10 times all depends on the power of your nose. The person in the next cubicle who sneezes 15 times in a row has truly wimpy sneezes. Sneezing once is something to brag about, maybe even put on your resume.

Bright light can make you sneeze.

This true phenomenon is called the photic sneeze reflex, and it affects up to 35 percent of the population. This sneeze tends to happen when suddenly moving from dim light to bright light, such as emerging from a movie theater or driving out of a tunnel. The photic sneeze reflex is thought to be genetic, but scientists are still puzzling over this one.

Satiation Brings On Snatiation (What?)

If you were born into a line of snatiators, then your genetically cursed family will have trouble talking over a big meal. That's because they'll be too busy sneezing as a result of their full stomachs. Scientists still don't fully understand the connection, but the neurons activated during digestion are perilously close to the sneezing neurons, and, well, you can glitch. Depending on who comes to Thanksgiving dinner, this can be a good or bad thing.

A study on snatiation found that the sneezing has no relation to what you're eating, and it occurs only when you are so full you can't possibly take another bite. Use this knowledge wisely.

Sneezing is ""catching,"" like a yawn.

It is true that emotions can affect your nasal membranes. Fear makes them shrink (which can make you sneeze), and sadness makes them swell (which can also make you sneeze.) Though there is conflicting evidence, yawning has been linked to empathy, and one study showed that psychopaths — people who lack empathy — may even be immune to contagious yawning.

If sneezing fits are like yawning fits, does that mean that if we are tuned into others' emotions, we might sneeze out of sympathy? Though hard evidence is murky, there is some reason to believe that both yawning and sneezing fits may be powered by the mind, and some sneezing fits have been successfully treated through psychotherapy.

The definitive answer is ""maybe."""

In France, a number of mayors in beach towns have banned the body and head-covering bathing suit worn by Muslim women known as the burkini. Muslims call it Islamophobia.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

Tensions between religious Muslims and secular France are playing out on the country's beaches this summer. Mayors of several beach towns have banned the burkini. That's a body-and-head-covering bathing suit worn by some Muslim women. They say - the mayors - that it's a sign of extremism. Enforcement has varied from beach to beach, though, as NPR's Eleanor Beardsley discovered on a trip to Normandy.

ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: The Normandy beach town of Deauville, known for horse racing and luxury hotels, is embroiled in a debate over the burkini this year. And everyone seems to have an opinion, whether they've seen one or not.

JOSE DAIREAUX: Yes, the bikini is fantastic.

BEARDSLEY: No, not the bikini, the burkini.

DAIREAUX: Ah, burkini (laughter). I don't know what is it, a burkini. I've never seen one. Do you have a picture of that?

BEARDSLEY: That 79 year old Jose Daireaux. When I finally do show him a picture of a burkini on my smartphone, he says it's absolutely wrong to allow that on the beach. He calls it an extension of the face-covering burqa and says France has to crack down on extremism. Philippe Guerin has been standing in the surf, talking to Daireaux. The middle school teacher completely disagrees.

PHILIPPE GUERIN: (Through interpreter) This is all links to the recent attacks and an Islamophobia that is rising in this country. People are confusing religion with terrorism. The racists are exploiting these attacks to try to make Muslims look like a terrorist threat.

UNIDENTIFIED AUCTIONEER: (Speaking French).

BEARDSLEY: Deauville Mayor Philippe Augier is attending the town's prestigious racehorse auction. So far, he says, he has no intention of banning the burkini. Augier says some mayors were pushed to because of tension in their communities. He mentions a beach brawl in Corsica, when some men took pictures of burkini-clad women.

PHILIPPE AUGIER: (Through interpreter) I don't have that problem. At the Deauville beach, everyone is there - Muslims and Jews and Christians - and it's a wonderful melting pot.

BEARDSLEY: Deauville is only a two-hour drive from Paris. And on this hot August afternoon, the beach is indeed a melting pot. This group of older Jewish sunbathers has been coming to Deauville for 35 years. They're angry about what they call an invasion of veiled women and burkinis. They don't want to give their names because of recent attacks on Jews by self-professed Islamist radicals.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking French).

BEARDSLEY: ""When you come to a country like France, you integrate,"" says this woman. ""That means you go swimming in a bathing suit, not a wetsuit."" This group says France has Judeo-Christian roots, not Islamic ones. And they say the country is being overrun by Muslims. Not far away, a group of young Muslims is playing volleyball. One of the women wearing a robe and veil is Wieem Zimzimi. She says the burkini is a wonderful liberation that allows some Muslim women to swim without heavy, wet robes. But this year, she feels uncomfortable wearing her burkini.

WIEEM ZIMZIMI: (Through interpreter) They're linking us to these terrorists, and we have nothing to do with their barbaric acts. We saw a group of nuns in their habits on the beach, and no one said a thing.

BEARDSLEY: Zimzimi says she and her friends are practicing Muslims and good French citizens. And she says they adhere completely to French values. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Deauville, France.

A fisherman in the Philippines might have discovered the largest natural pearl ever found — and then kept it hidden under his bed for 10 years.

The pearl's existence was revealed by Aileen Cynthia Maggay-Amurao, a tourism officer in Puerto Princesa, on the island of Palawan.

She says the fisherman is one of her relatives and that he discovered it in a giant clam and kept it as a good-luck charm.

When he was moving out of his home, he decided to give the pearl to Maggay-Amurao for safekeeping instead of transporting it with him — ""since it's quite heavy,"" she told The Guardian.

In fact, the pearl weighs in at 34 kilograms, Maggay-Amurao says — or approximately 75 pounds.

It's more than 2 feet long and 1 foot wide, CNN reports.

That would make it far and away the largest natural pearl ever found in a giant clam. The current world record is held by another pearl found off the coast of Palawan — ""The Pearl of Allah"" or ""Pearl of Lao Tzu,"" which was discovered in the '30s and cost a diver's life to retrieve.

That pearl, which the Guardian says was valued at $93 million in 2003, weighs 14 pounds — a fraction of the size of the newly revealed pearl.

The 75-pound pearl is now on display in the city hall of Puerto Princesa; the local government has dubbed it the ""Pearl of Puerto.""

Maggay-Amurao, who says she persuaded her relative to display the pearl instead of hiding it, has called for gemologists to visit Puerto Princesa to examine the pearl for authenticity and an estimate of its value.

A spokesman for the Puerto Princesa government says the fisherman who found the pearl hasn't signed it over to the city, Agence France-Presse reports. ""It remains his property,"" the spokesman says, confirming that the man could be in for an extraordinary windfall.

For the record, a 75-pound pearl would be 170,000 carats."

Behold the Dreamers by Imbolo Mbue Hardcover, 382 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?

In 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. It took just hours for the catastrophic effects of the company's failure to become apparent to ordinary people all across the world, even ones who had never before heard terms like ""subprime mortgage"" and ""collateralized debt obligation.""

Jende Jonga and his wife, Neni, two of the main characters in Imbolo Mbue's excellent debut novel, Behold the Dreamers, are among those people. Her book isn't the first work of fiction to grapple with the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, but it's surely one of the best.

Jende and Neni have recently immigrated to America from the city of Limbe in Cameroon, hoping to build a better life for their young son, Liomi, a sweet and sensitive six-year-old who idolizes his father.

They're barely able to make ends meet. Neni works as a home health aide while attending college — she dreams of one day enrolling in pharmacy school — while Jende drives a cab. Their luck changes suddenly, though, when Jende finds work as a personal chauffeur for a Lehman Brothers executive named Clark Edwards and his family. The hours are long, but the salary is a massive improvement over his previous job.

Clark grows to trust Jende, and Neni eventually takes a temporary job cleaning and cooking at the Edwards' second home. It doesn't take long before Jende and Neni both learn that the Edwards' marriage isn't as perfect as it might seem. This becomes painfully apparent after Lehman Brothers declares bankruptcy just weeks before what would become a historic presidential election.

'Behold the Dreamers' isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse.

Meanwhile, Jende is forced to confront problems of his own. While his wife is in America on a student visa, he's in the country waiting for his asylum application to be approved. But he's not really facing persecution in his home country, and he's hoping the smooth-talking immigration lawyer he's hired can persuade a judge otherwise.

He can't bear the thought of returning to Cameroon. When he talks about America, it's with rapturous joy, and an unflinching belief in the promise of his adopted country. ""America has something for everyone, sir,"" he enthuses to Clark. ""Look at Obama, sir. Who is his mother? Who is his father? They are not big people in the government. ... The man is a black man with no father or mother, trying to be president over a country!""

Those who lived through the turbulent final years of the George W. Bush administration remember that it brought out the worst in a lot of people — not just in the bankers and politicians who let the crisis occur in the first place, but in ordinary citizens brought to the edge by the threat of financial ruin.

Mbue realizes this, and she does not pull punches. Behold the Dreamers is, at times, hard to read — not because of her writing, which is excellent, but because the characters keep getting hit, over and over again, by horrible circumstances beyond their control. Jende is reminded that ""bad news has a way of slithering into good days and making a mockery of complacent joys;"" Neni feels ""crushed"" by her own feelings of helplessness, ""the fact that she had traveled to America only to be reminded of how powerless she was, how unfair life could be.""

Behold the Dreamers isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse. In one scene, Clark's wife commiserates with a wealthy friend about the crisis. Her friend's priorities are almost comically misplaced: ""But it's scary how bad this could get,"" she says, ""When people start talking about flying coach and selling vacation homes ...""

That's not to say Mbue doesn't lack compassion for her characters — while some are oblivious, they have real problems of their own, and she's never cruel or condescending. Mbue's heart is with the Jonga family, torn between their love for — and disappointment with — America. But it's also with the Edwards family, unable to cope with the thought that their days of privilege might soon be coming to an end.

Behold the Dreamers is a remarkable debut. Mbue is a wonderful writer with an uncanny ear for dialogue — there are no false notes here, no narrative shortcuts, and certainly no manufactured happy endings. It's a novel that depicts a country both blessed and doomed, on top of the world, but always at risk of losing its balance. It is, in other words, quintessentially American."

Updated at 7:10 p.m. ET

Like a lot of people's grandmothers, Flonzie Brown-Wright keeps a candy jar in the living room of her single-story home, which is also adorned with potted plants and family photos.

For Brown-Wright, 74, this jar is a reminder of the absurd questions — questions with no real answers — that she and other African-Americans had to answer before registering to vote in Mississippi in the 1960s.

""'How many jelly beans in a pound of candy? ... 'How many feathers are on a chicken?' And I got a bar of soap somewhere – but anyway, how many bubbles in a bar of soap?'"" she recalled.

Brown-Wright says you could pass or fail those tests on the whim of an election commissioner. She failed the first time, but eventually became election commissioner herself in nearby Madison County, Miss. — a groundbreaking achievement for a black woman in the Deep South in the late 1960s.

Now Brown-Wright is not pleased with the current political climate she says Donald Trump is fostering — and she's not alone. Trump has been promising to help bring jobs and security to black neighborhoods. But his poll numbers with African-Americans are in the low single digits, and many say his message is insulting.

Brown-Wright now gives workshops on voting rights at local colleges, where she takes her jelly bean jar and soap bar.""I try and make it real for people so people understand clearly that this is not something that we're just making up. That was on the test,"" she said.

""It's been in my lifetime that I could not register and vote freely. So when I contrast the then and the now, in many respects, this is not what we really fought for — in terms of the animus, in terms of the hate-filled slogans and rallies and all of that,"" she says.

Brown-Wright says the Republican nominee is painting African-American communities with a broad brush, and insulting black voters with his rhetoric, which she calls ""a joke.""

Lowering her voice to mimic Trump, she says, ""'Uh, your schools are no good!' Is that a way to get a vote? 'You have no jobs!' It's just so condescending.""

Brown-Wright says despite Trump's claim that he's reaching out to African American voters – and his visit this week to Jackson, a majority-black city – his message does not seem ""genuine.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR

A much younger generation of black activists in Jackson seem to feel the same about the Republican nominee the question he posted to African Americans recently: ""What do you have to lose?""

""We have a lot to lose,"" Avery Brown, a Jackson State University senior, said with a nervous laugh. ""I mean, I guess there's this notion that we're already so far on the bottom that we can't go any further down?""

Brown is an intern working on a voter registration drive at the Mississippi NAACP office in Jackson. She hopes to attend law school after graduation. Brown says at this point, given Trump's past statements about other minority groups like Latinos and Muslims, there's nothing Trump could say to win her vote.

""And for him to say that he just wants to make black communities better, but while at the same time putting us down, it doesn't add up. You can't make someone better while telling them that they aren't worth anything, or they don't have anything to lose,"" she said.

For their part, the Trump campaign offered a response from their director of African-American outreach, Omarosa Manigault. ""The Democrats continue to take the African-American community for granted. It is disconcerting that they would rather pander than formulate substantive policy plans that would actually improve conditions as opposed to continue down the current path of the last eight years,"" Manigault said in a statement.

The campaign also provided a response from African-American pastor Mark Burns, who campaigns frequently with Trump. In a statement, Burns said, ""Mr. Trump's critics are just that, critical. African-Americans aren't stupid, we are worse off than where we were eight years ago. We are, as a people, tired of being used by the Democratic Party. Black Lives don't matter to Hillary Clinton, Black Voting Power Matters to Hillary Clinton.""

At the NAACP office in Jackson on Wednesday morning, several pastors and local leaders held a press conference to denounce Trump ahead of his campaign rally. President Derrick Johnson and others accused Trump of spreading intolerance, and being slow to disavow white supremacist support.

Johnson pointed to the state's history of racial segregation and violence, saying that Trump ""clings to the hateful and intolerant rhetoric of this country's shameful history – a history that we know all too well.""

On the other side of the city, Percy Glasper works in the kitchen at Fred's Soul Food restaurant.

Glasper, who is African-American, says he's not offended by Trump. He thinks Trump is just making outlandish statements to drum up media attention.

""It only makes his ratings go up. When you're in front of the camera, you do anything to get your shine on,"" Glasper says.

Glasper is 40, and a father of four who says he doubts he will vote in November.

""I voted for Obama in the last election and me personally, I didn't see no result. I voted for Bush ... I still didn't see no result,"" he says. ""So I gotta get it myself, you know what I'm saying?""

Glasper says he just wants to make enough money to get out of Mississippi, take his kids on trips, and see the world — or at least, Seattle or St. Louis. He added that he doesn't think there's much any president will do to improve his life."

Los Angeles musician Gabriel Reyes-Whittaker had a problem: A few years ago, he was asked to tackle the weighty subject of Latin American modernism in sound. His response was to invent a new persona, and to restrict himself to a spare and specific set of tools. Under the new name Frankie Reyes, he set off to record a dozen instrumental versions of Spanish-language ballads and waltzes from the 1930s through the '60s, using only a vintage analog synthesizer.

The resulting album, Boleros Valses y Mas, is a novelty record in the best sense of the term: making something new and unusual by mining older songs and technologies. If you're familiar with the original songs, you'll notice that Reyes isn't doing anything dramatic with his arrangements. The Oberheim synthesizer isn't even that old — it hit the market in the late '70s. But in using it to remake these standards from generations earlier, Reyes disrupts our sense of where, and especially when, these songs first came out.

YouTube

One of my favorite things about Boleros Valses y Mas is how every listen inspires new metaphors to try to describe it. So far, I've come up with: ""It's from an old Puerto Rican sci-fi movie soundtrack,"" or, ""It's what you'd hear during a graveyard carousel ride,"" or, ""It's what a band might play if your quinceañera happened to fall on the Day of the Dead."" And though those all work to a degree, the magic and mystery of Frankie Reyes's sound always feels just outside the realm of description, but well within that of imagination."

The NBA has officially moved the 2017 NBA All-Star game to New Orleans because of the controversy surrounding North Carolina's transgender bathroom law. For historical reasons, the change is fitting.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

The NBA recently announced that it's 2017 All-Star game will be played in New Orleans, La. The game was originally supposed to take place in Charlotte, N.C., but it was moved after the state passed a bill limiting anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people. That got commentator Kevin Blackistone thinking about New Orleans' own history of civil rights in sports.

KEVIN BLACKISTONE, BYLINE: The National Basketball Association did not point to the coincidence in its announcement last Friday that it was rewarding New Orleans with its 2017 All-Star game - a game originally intended for Charlotte, N.C., next February. But the coincidence is rich - as rich as a 70 to 100 million dollars the four-day event is estimated to drop upon the cities in which it lands.

The reason the NBA extricated its All-Star event from Charlotte was because of North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill. The U.S. Department of Justice deemed it a probable violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because the bill limits anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people by, among other things, forcing them to use the bathroom of their birth sex. But half a century ago - 1965 to be exact - it was New Orleans that suddenly lost a professional sports all-star game because of its lack of tolerance and fair treatment of all.

Middle-1960s New Orleans was a typical Jim Crow Southern city. The main drag, Canal Street, was lined with stores and eateries in which black people couldn't get service. Even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed, black residents of New Orleans suffered those slights, as did black visitors, like 21 football players chosen to play there January 16, 1965, in the American Football League All-Star game. The Buffalo Bills' all-star rookie defensive back, Butch Byrd, recalled how, upon arriving at New Orleans' airport, he couldn't get a cab to his downtown hotel.

Other black players couldn't enjoy a night on the town because restaurants and clubs refused to admit them. And passersby splattered them with racial epithets. The black players called for a meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel, where half the all-stars stayed. They decided not to play. We were led to believe that we could relax and enjoy ourselves in New Orleans just like other citizens, Bills' all-star end Ernie Warlick told the team's website several years ago.

The AFL didn't have to decide what to do. The black players' white teammates made the decision for the league. If the game were to go on despite the absence of the black players, I would not play, San Diego all-star tackle Ron Mix nix told the Pro Football Hall of Fame recently. It was important for at least one white player to join them, to say we're with you. Mix discovered he was not alone.

On Monday, January 11, 1965, AFL commissioner Joe Foss made an unprecedented announcement - the nationally televised game was being moved due to a protest over discrimination. The record books says the Western conference eventually won that game at a high school stadium in Houston, but the real winner that year was the collective power of athletes to force righteous change.

Jende and Neni have recently immigrated to America from the city of Limbe in Cameroon, hoping to build a better life for their young son, Liomi, a sweet and sensitive six-year-old who idolizes his father.

They're barely able to make ends meet. Neni works as a home health aide while attending college — she dreams of one day enrolling in pharmacy school — while Jende drives a cab. Their luck changes suddenly, though, when Jende finds work as a personal chauffeur for a Lehman Brothers executive named Clark Edwards and his family. The hours are long, but the salary is a massive improvement over his previous job.

Clark grows to trust Jende, and Neni eventually takes a temporary job cleaning and cooking at the Edwards' second home. It doesn't take long before Jende and Neni both learn that the Edwards' marriage isn't as perfect as it might seem. This becomes painfully apparent after Lehman Brothers declares bankruptcy just weeks before what would become a historic presidential election.

'Behold the Dreamers' isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse.

Meanwhile, Jende is forced to confront problems of his own. While his wife is in America on a student visa, he's in the country waiting for his asylum application to be approved. But he's not really facing persecution in his home country, and he's hoping the smooth-talking immigration lawyer he's hired can persuade a judge otherwise.

He can't bear the thought of returning to Cameroon. When he talks about America, it's with rapturous joy, and an unflinching belief in the promise of his adopted country. ""America has something for everyone, sir,"" he enthuses to Clark. ""Look at Obama, sir. Who is his mother? Who is his father? They are not big people in the government. ... The man is a black man with no father or mother, trying to be president over a country!""

Those who lived through the turbulent final years of the George W. Bush administration remember that it brought out the worst in a lot of people — not just in the bankers and politicians who let the crisis occur in the first place, but in ordinary citizens brought to the edge by the threat of financial ruin.

Mbue realizes this, and she does not pull punches. Behold the Dreamers is, at times, hard to read — not because of her writing, which is excellent, but because the characters keep getting hit, over and over again, by horrible circumstances beyond their control. Jende is reminded that ""bad news has a way of slithering into good days and making a mockery of complacent joys;"" Neni feels ""crushed"" by her own feelings of helplessness, ""the fact that she had traveled to America only to be reminded of how powerless she was, how unfair life could be.""

Behold the Dreamers isn't a satire, but it's frequently caustic, and Mbue can be unsparing in her depiction of the elite who didn't see their very existence threatened by the financial collapse. In one scene, Clark's wife commiserates with a wealthy friend about the crisis. Her friend's priorities are almost comically misplaced: ""But it's scary how bad this could get,"" she says, ""When people start talking about flying coach and selling vacation homes ...""

That's not to say Mbue doesn't lack compassion for her characters — while some are oblivious, they have real problems of their own, and she's never cruel or condescending. Mbue's heart is with the Jonga family, torn between their love for — and disappointment with — America. But it's also with the Edwards family, unable to cope with the thought that their days of privilege might soon be coming to an end.

Behold the Dreamers is a remarkable debut. Mbue is a wonderful writer with an uncanny ear for dialogue — there are no false notes here, no narrative shortcuts, and certainly no manufactured happy endings. It's a novel that depicts a country both blessed and doomed, on top of the world, but always at risk of losing its balance. It is, in other words, quintessentially American."

A potentially habitable planet about the size of Earth is orbiting the star that is nearest our solar system, according to scientists who describe the find Wednesday in the journal Nature.

The newly discovered planet orbits Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf star that's just 4.25 light-years from Earth — about 25 trillion miles away. The star is too faint to be seen with the naked eye and is close to a much brighter and more famous pair of stars called Alpha Centauri A and B.

Researchers detected the planet by observing how its star wobbled as the planet traveled around it. All that's known about the planet is that it's a bit more massive than Earth and circles its star once every 11 days. Because the star is so dim, temperatures on the planet would be mild enough that any water — if it's there — would be liquid.

""We're talking about a planet that has very similar properties to Earth,"" says Guillem Anglada-Escude of Queen Mary University of London, who led the research team of more than 30 scientists around the world. They have called their campaign to discover this planet Pale Red Dot, after astronomer Carl Sagan's observation that, from other solar systems, Earth would look like a pale blue dot.

Despite some similarities to Earth, if you could stand on this other world, it would still look plenty alien. That's because it is likely that only one side of it ever faces its star.

Looking up from the planet's surface, the star would seem stationary in the sky, says Anglada-Escude, and is so orange that if the planet had an atmosphere like ours, the heavens would perpetually have the color of ""a late autumn sunset.""

Scientists have discovered thousands of planets orbiting distant stars, including a bunch that might be potentially habitable. The proximity of this new planet means scientists will have an easier time doing follow-up studies to learn more about it and even obtain images.

""I'm pretty sure that in the next 10 years, we will know if it has an atmosphere and probably if it has oxygen,"" says Anglada-Escude, who adds that we could even see hints of any life that might be there. He thinks the news that our closest stellar neighbor is orbited by a world that has a shot at possibly supporting life is sure to spur interest in an interstellar mission to pay it a visit.

""It's tantalizing,"" he says. ""Now that we know the planet is there, we can be more creative. We can think about solutions — maybe to send interstellar probes or to design specific spacecraft to look for this planet and only this planet.""

Ofer Cohen of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not part of the research team, says he finds the evidence of the planet's existence convincing. But as to whether it is potentially habitable, ""it's all down to how we define habitability,"" Cohen says.

While the temperatures at the surface might allow for liquid water, he says, ""in reality, nature is much more complicated."" His studies suggest that planets orbiting this type of star need to have a strong magnetic field to protect the atmosphere from being destroyed by the stellar wind.

Edward Guinan, an astronomer at Villanova University, says when he first learned of this new planet a couple of months ago, he seriously doubted that it would have any chance of being habitable. That's because being close to a star means that a planet's atmosphere and any water could get blown away, as the planet is exposed to the stellar wind, flares, X-rays and ultraviolet radiation.

""I was dubious that it could work out to be habitable. My first impression is that it wouldn't be,"" Guinan says. ""And the surprise was, this planet has a chance to have a habitable climate.""

He and a group of colleagues analyzed the possibilities and concluded that there are plausible scenarios that would have left this planet capable of supporting life. So if he were betting, he'd now say there was about a 25 percent chance that it could be a habitable world.

""To have the nearest star with a possibly habitable Earth-sized planet is terrific,"" Guinan says. ""It's wonderful. I'm just really excited.""

And while 4.25 light-years might seem like an impossibly vast distance, that's practically next door in the eyes of astronomers who are used to thinking on a cosmic scale.

""You can get to a tenth of the speed of light with present technology,"" Guinan notes, pointing out that a trip to this planet would take less than half a century.

""And that's not bad,"" he says. ""That's feasible."""

Updated at 7:10 p.m. ET

Like a lot of people's grandmothers, Flonzie Brown-Wright keeps a candy jar in the living room of her single-story home, which is also adorned with potted plants and family photos.

For Brown-Wright, 74, this jar is a reminder of the absurd questions — questions with no real answers — that she and other African-Americans had to answer before registering to vote in Mississippi in the 1960s.

""'How many jelly beans in a pound of candy? ... 'How many feathers are on a chicken?' And I got a bar of soap somewhere – but anyway, how many bubbles in a bar of soap?'"" she recalled.

Brown-Wright says you could pass or fail those tests on the whim of an election commissioner. She failed the first time, but eventually became election commissioner herself in nearby Madison County, Miss. — a groundbreaking achievement for a black woman in the Deep South in the late 1960s.

Now Brown-Wright is not pleased with the current political climate she says Donald Trump is fostering — and she's not alone. Trump has been promising to help bring jobs and security to black neighborhoods. But his poll numbers with African-Americans are in the low single digits, and many say his message is insulting.

Brown-Wright now gives workshops on voting rights at local colleges, where she takes her jelly bean jar and soap bar.""I try and make it real for people so people understand clearly that this is not something that we're just making up. That was on the test,"" she said.

""It's been in my lifetime that I could not register and vote freely. So when I contrast the then and the now, in many respects, this is not what we really fought for — in terms of the animus, in terms of the hate-filled slogans and rallies and all of that,"" she says.

Brown-Wright says the Republican nominee is painting African-American communities with a broad brush, and insulting black voters with his rhetoric, which she calls ""a joke.""

Lowering her voice to mimic Trump, she says, ""'Uh, your schools are no good!' Is that a way to get a vote? 'You have no jobs!' It's just so condescending.""

Brown-Wright says despite Trump's claim that he's reaching out to African American voters – and his visit this week to Jackson, a majority-black city – his message does not seem ""genuine.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sarah McCammon/NPR Sarah McCammon/NPR

A much younger generation of black activists in Jackson seem to feel the same about the Republican nominee the question he posted to African Americans recently: ""What do you have to lose?""

""We have a lot to lose,"" Avery Brown, a Jackson State University senior, said with a nervous laugh. ""I mean, I guess there's this notion that we're already so far on the bottom that we can't go any further down?""

Brown is an intern working on a voter registration drive at the Mississippi NAACP office in Jackson. She hopes to attend law school after graduation. Brown says at this point, given Trump's past statements about other minority groups like Latinos and Muslims, there's nothing Trump could say to win her vote.

""And for him to say that he just wants to make black communities better, but while at the same time putting us down, it doesn't add up. You can't make someone better while telling them that they aren't worth anything, or they don't have anything to lose,"" she said.

For their part, the Trump campaign offered a response from their director of African-American outreach, Omarosa Manigault. ""The Democrats continue to take the African-American community for granted. It is disconcerting that they would rather pander than formulate substantive policy plans that would actually improve conditions as opposed to continue down the current path of the last eight years,"" Manigault said in a statement.

The campaign also provided a response from African-American pastor Mark Burns, who campaigns frequently with Trump. In a statement, Burns said, ""Mr. Trump's critics are just that, critical. African-Americans aren't stupid, we are worse off than where we were eight years ago. We are, as a people, tired of being used by the Democratic Party. Black Lives don't matter to Hillary Clinton, Black Voting Power Matters to Hillary Clinton.""

At the NAACP office in Jackson on Wednesday morning, several pastors and local leaders held a press conference to denounce Trump ahead of his campaign rally. President Derrick Johnson and others accused Trump of spreading intolerance, and being slow to disavow white supremacist support.

Johnson pointed to the state's history of racial segregation and violence, saying that Trump ""clings to the hateful and intolerant rhetoric of this country's shameful history – a history that we know all too well.""

On the other side of the city, Percy Glasper works in the kitchen at Fred's Soul Food restaurant.

Glasper, who is African-American, says he's not offended by Trump. He thinks Trump is just making outlandish statements to drum up media attention.

""It only makes his ratings go up. When you're in front of the camera, you do anything to get your shine on,"" Glasper says.

Glasper is 40, and a father of four who says he doubts he will vote in November.

""I voted for Obama in the last election and me personally, I didn't see no result. I voted for Bush ... I still didn't see no result,"" he says. ""So I gotta get it myself, you know what I'm saying?""

Glasper says he just wants to make enough money to get out of Mississippi, take his kids on trips, and see the world — or at least, Seattle or St. Louis. He added that he doesn't think there's much any president will do to improve his life."

Bernie Sanders is launching a new political organization. It's called Our Revolution. It aims to support candidates and, according to its website, ""advance the progressive agenda that we believe in.""

But the revolution is getting off to a rocky start.

Eight key staffers abruptly resigned over the weekend in a dispute over the group's leadership and legal structure.

Sanders himself is set to address followers on Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET for the launch of the group. You can watch that here:

YouTube

Among the departures was the group's organizing director, Claire Sandberg, who also worked on the Sanders presidential campaign. Sandberg is critical of Our Revolution's director, former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver, for structuring the group as a 501(c)(4) (the section of the IRS code for a ""social welfare"" organization).

Sandberg charges that Weaver did that so ""he could take big checks from billionaires.""

But the 501(c)(4) status also means the group can't contribute directly to candidates many Sanders backers support, such as Tim Canova, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary against former Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The incumbent has been a target of Sanders supporters, who charge she improperly backed Hillary Clinton for the nomination.

Allowing unlimited contributions from anonymous groups is also the polar opposite of the presidential campaign, in which Sanders rarely failed to point out his average contribution was $27.

But Weaver says there is a difference between a presidential campaign and a group like Our Revolution. In a presidential race, he said, ""You don't want somebody elected, who is beholden to wealthy individuals or interests.""

But in the case of a nonprofit like Our Revolution, Weaver added, ""I have nothing to offer people in return for their support"" other than pushing forward the progressive goals and agenda that those who supported Sanders share.

There is another reason for the walkout at Our Revolution: Weaver himself.

Sanders supporters like Sandberg blame Weaver for Sanders' coming up short in his quest for the nomination. She said bluntly that those who worked on the campaign ""saw that his failed leadership is what cost Bernie the nomination.""

Weaver shrugs off the criticism, saying he, too, was disappointed by the outcome, and that ""if it's cathartic for people to sort of make me the lightning rod for their upset about not having won, I'm certainly willing to play that role for them.""

What's unclear is what role the Vermont senator will have in Our Revolution. As a federal officeholder, Sanders faces limits on the kind of fundraising he can do for other candidates.

Weaver said Our Revolution aims to tap into the enthusiasm that led to Sanders' winning 23 primaries and caucuses, by supporting candidates for down-ballot races and working to train future candidates to create, as he put it, ""a progressive bench."""

Vice President Joe Biden is on a fence-mending mission, meeting with Turkey's president and other officials during a two-day visit. A failed coup attempt in July has strained Turkey-U.S. relations.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Turkey today on what's being seen as a fence-mending mission. Ties have been strained between the two countries since an attempted coup last month. Some Turks believe the United States knew about the plot in advance or even supported it. After meeting Turkey's prime minister, Vice President Biden was emphatic in his denial.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VICE PRES JOE BIDEN: The people of the United States of America abhor what happened and under no circumstances would support anything remotely approaching the cowardly act of the treasonous members of your military.

GREENE: Now, let's remember, Turkey is an important ally for the United States. It's a NATO member and central in the fight against ISIS, working closely with the U.S. military. Biden reminded Turks that this is a relationship that benefits both sides.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BIDEN: The people of Turkey have no greater friend - if you'll excuse me for being so self-serving - have no greater friend than the United States of America.

GREENE: OK, let's talk about this with our correspondent who's based in Istanbul. NPR's Peter Kenyon is on the line. Peter, good morning.

PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, David.

GREENE: So are they patching things up?

KENYON: Well, yes and no. The tone of the meeting between Biden and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was very friendly and respectful as best we can tell from the news conference they did afterwards. But it was also clear that some of what happened in the meeting was an airing of views, not necessarily a meeting of minds.

GREENE: (Laughter) Good way to put it.

KENYON: Biden even joked - yeah, well, Biden was moved to joke towards the end about having had a frank and candid exchange of views, which, as you know, is standard diplomatic speak for not getting along.

GREENE: Yeah, when you hear frank and candid you wonder how angry things got if they got angry.

KENYON: Yeah, a good question. But a big part of Biden's visit beyond that is to clear the air about some of the suspicions, the claims that have been circulating - you've already mentioned some of them - starting in the pro-government media, but even extending to some members of the government, about whether America really supports Turkey's elected government. And Biden was all in on that. He denied it all. And he, you know, saluted the Turkish people. But there are still some differences of opinion remaining, and they're not going to disappear immediately.

GREENE: And one of those differences involves this Islamic cleric, who is based in Pennsylvania right now, who the Turks really blame for masterminding the coup. I mean, is this something that we believe came up in these meetings?

KENYON: Oh, it did. It's the really big issue for Turkey. There's no chance it wasn't going to come up on their side. Fethullah Gulen - he's lived in Pennsylvania for years - denies any involvement in the coup attempt. But most Turks, many Turks at least, are convinced he was behind it. The government has warrants out for his arrest, demanding his return. Biden was quite sympathetic - he spoke directly to this - about the anger felt on the streets of Turkey. But he didn't budge on the need to satisfy due process in the legal world. Here's what he said.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BIDEN: We have no, no, no, no interest whatsoever in protecting anyone who has done harm to an ally. None. But we need to meet the legal standard requirement under our law.

KENYON: Now, the prime minister on the Turkish side was pretty appreciative of some of what's happened - the U.S. expert delegation that just spent two days here going over the evidentiary issues and other technical things. But he did repeat that Turkey's wish is that all this legal procedure could just happen instantly, as he put it, and result - let's get to the end game and get Fethullah Gulen back here to face charges. So clearly that's still a difference.

GREENE: OK. So Biden's saying this is something that would have to work through the legal process. You know, Peter, interesting timing here because this meeting is taking place at a moment when the Turkish military has just moved into Syria going after ISIS. I mean, the U.S. and Turkey have been working hand in hand in that fight. What is the latest there?

KENYON: Well, it's a big deal for the Turkish military, you know, which as we know is still recovering from this failed coup attempt. Turkish tanks, special forces entered Syria in an unusual show of military force on the ground. This is largely a Turkish effort. There is some U.S. air surveillance support. There's ground troops from the Free Syrian Army and other Western-backed rebel groups but an unusually strong role for Turkey this time. And President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says, last weekend's bombing in Gaziantep - 54 dead at a wedding - that was the last straw. And the big goal is to clear ISIS out of the border area, but it also has another effect. It makes sure that Syrian Kurdish forces do not take this border town of Jarablus. And that's something Turkey is eager to prevent.

GREENE: And just remind us there about the Kurds, Peter, because some disagreement - I mean, Turkey has always considered Kurdish militias as terrorist groups coming after Turkey within its borders. But the United States has been working with Kurds in the fight against ISIS, right?

KENYON: Well, that's exactly right. And it's a red line for the Turks - the Euphrates River in Syria. And the Kurdish fighters crossed that river when they took the city of Manbij from ISIS. Turkey wants them back across to the west side of the river. And today, Vice President Biden was explicit, saying we have told the Kurds that they better get back across the river or they're going to lose American support.

GREENE: OK, lots to talk about as Vice President Joe Biden visits Turkey today. We've been speaking with NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Peter, thanks a lot.

KENYON: Thanks, David.

In Maine's North Woods, forests and rivers that used to feed paper mills will now be permanently protected as a national monument — thanks to a donation by the co-founder of Burt's Bees.

President Obama announced the creation of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument on Wednesday, just one day before the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service.

The designation of the woods as protected territory has been in the works for years — and has been controversial among locals, who worried about federal oversight of lands that used to be central to the regional economy.

Pros And Cons Of Proposed Maine Woods National Park Listen · 3:50 3:50

The new monument encompasses some 87,500 acres of ""awe-inspiring mountains, forests and waters,"" as the White House puts it. The land ""is rich in biodiversity and known for its outstanding opportunities to hike, canoe, hunt, fish, snowmobile, snowshoe and cross-country ski,"" the administration notes.

Susan Sharon of Maine Public Radio put it a little more poetically earlier this year:

""The heart of the North Woods, about 3.5 million acres, remains the largest undeveloped territory east of the Rockies. This is the same continuousness of forest that captivated naturalist Henry David Thoreau 150 years ago. Still mostly uninhabited, it's a place that crawled with rugged lumberjacks armed with heavy axes, where logs by the millions were floated downriver to mill towns that sprung up out of the woods themselves.""

The monument, which will be managed by the National Park Service, will allow those recreational activities while also protecting natural resources.

It was established with a donation of land and tens of millions of dollars, all from Roxanne Quimby.

Along with Burt Shavitz, she founded a company widely known for its lip balms and other personal care products, as we reported last year:

""Burt's Bees began in 1984 when Shavitz met an artist named Roxanne Quimby. According to the company's website, Quimby 'was thumbing a ride home (back when you could still do that sort of thing). Eventually a bright yellow Datsun pickup truck pulled over, and Roxanne instantly recognized Burt Shavitz, a local fella whose beard was almost as well-known as his roadside honey stand. Burt and Roxanne hit it off, and before long, Roxanne was making candles with unused wax from Burt's beehives. They made $200 at their first craft fair; within a year, they'd make $20,000.' ""The company grew and moved its headquarters to Durham, N.C., in 1993. But Shavitz's partnership with Quimby unraveled in the late '90s. The Daily Beast, citing Shavitz and a documentary titled Burt's Buzz, says the two reached a settlement after Quimby found out Burt had an affair with a college-age girl who worked at one of the Burt's Bees stores. ""Quimby eventually bought out Shavitz. Burt's Bees is now owned by the Clorox Co.""

Burt's Bees made Quimby wealthy, and she used her fortune to buy large quantities of former timber land in northern Maine.

But her plans to protect the landscape weren't welcomed by all local residents, as Susan Sharon reported for NPR in 2011:

""For generations, Maine's North Woods have provided pulp for the state's paper mills and created plenty of good jobs in an area with little other economic activity. But now the paper industry is struggling and a mill job is no longer a guarantee. ... ""Quimby used her newfound fortune to buy up land in Maine's North Woods from downsizing paper companies. Some local residents see her as a villain for closing off her land to hunting and snowmobiling — activities the paper companies have long allowed — and for taking it out of timber production.""

There were fierce debates over the merits of giving the land to the National Park Service — some saw it as a source of tourist income for the region, others as federal oversight.

Opposition continued up until the declaration of the monument on Wednesday.

""Some locals, including Maine's timber industry, and the Sportsman's Alliance object to federal control of the land, and Maine's congressional delegation refused to back legislation to make the area a national park,"" NPR's Scott Horsley reports.

""President Obama instead used his executive authority to create the monument,"" Scott says. ""The White House notes that Maine's popular Acadia National Park was created in a similar fashion, a century ago."""

With a stark color palette out of the film Beyond The Black Rainbow, Scott Cudmore directs this unsettling, note-perfect video for ""Needs."" Androids are controlled, objectified and used for what can only be assumed are unsavory ends, but the androids retaliate. Cudmore says he wanted to show the system's failure, though he leaves its actual dismantling to our imagination.

Old, entitled white men. This is a video about them and the system of oppression and exploitation that they've created to serve their... well, needs, which are usually money and power. I'm looking at this through the lens of science fiction, but I wanted to depict that power structure breaking down finally. Breaking down internally. There's no linear narrative, and you are free to think of that aspect in any way, but each image is a depiction of this breakdown, as well as of repression, exploitation and desperation.

To a mathematician, it's a violent explosion that shoots out missiles of hot, wet air, slamming a turbulent cloud of moisture into anybody or anything that crosses its path.

To the rest of us, it's a sneeze.

And Lydia Bourouiba has made a career out of studying it. Bourouiba, a mathematical physicist, leads a research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that studies fluid dynamics. On Wednesday, her team published a slow-motion video of a sneeze in the New England Journal of Medicine.

It's mesmerizing. It's also important.

""Respiratory infectious diseases still remain the leading infectious diseases in the world,"" Bourouiba explains. Many of them hop from person to person in coughs and sneezes, or ""violent emissions,"" as she calls them. If she can understand how a sneeze moves, she says, she can better understand how to prevent microbes from moving from a sick person or contaminated surface to somebody else.

Debunking Sneeze Myths Did you know that sneezing itself can be contagious? And why do people say ""God bless you"" after somebody spews infectious particles? Shots investigates some of the myths and truths behind this commonplace bodily function in a special bonus story here. Enlarge this image toggle caption Library of Congress Library of Congress

But as the researchers watched videos of these mini-explosions, they quickly realized that a sneeze involves complicated physics.

""There's a whole range of droplet sizes in this cloud, and the cloud is made of hot and moist air,"" says Bourouiba. ""And it's turbulent, so that means that it has swirls and eddies, and it's moving very fast."" The conditions in the surrounding room — like airflow, moisture and temperature — can change how all those swirls and zigzags move, she says.

A lot of the sanitation measures we're all told to take to stay out of the way of someone else's sneeze are educated guesses at best, says Bourouiba. For example, people have assumed that standing a few feet away from a sick person would be enough to stay out of firing range. But Bourouiba and her colleagues found that the tiny droplets in a sneeze can, under certain conditions, travel across a room in just a few seconds. They can also hover in the air for many minutes.

""It's actually quite amazing that we can produce such a high-speed flow that contains all these ranges of sizes of droplets,"" Bourouiba says.

A sneeze is ""quite a fantastic tool for clearance,"" she adds, ""but also a fantastic tool to sustain the overall colonization of other bodies and other people with viruses and pathogens.""

To map the path of a sneeze — and of any infectious particles it might contain — Bourouiba had to become an expert in high-speed photography. So far, her subjects have been healthy sneezers. But now, Bourouiba and her colleagues have started enlisting the help of volunteers who have symptoms of a cold or flu, inviting these sick folks to sneeze in a special room that has controlled moisture, airflow and temperature, as well as camera equipment.

The ultimate goal of this study, she says, is to understand in detail how sneezes travel in different conditions.

""So, for example, in a typical hospital room, with a given ambient temperature and moisture and a given airflow, what is the ultimate distribution of the position of these droplets and the pathogens they contain?"" says Bourouiba. ""And if we change the room and ventilation and different environmental conditions, how does that change?""

Armed with that information, the researchers hope to make risk maps for which parts of a room are likely to get contaminated by a sick person, or figure out how far away a visitor needs to stand from a patient to stay out of the line of fire. The information might also improve the design of ventilation systems to help prevent infected droplets from dispersing through a building.

As for Bourouiba's own technique for squelching the spread of a cold, she recommends sneezing into your elbow. What's the physics there? The elbow reduces the cloud's momentum, she says, limiting how far those virus-filled droplets will travel."

A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook central Myanmar around 5 p.m. local time on Wednesday, damaging buildings and sending people running into the streets across the region.

At least three people are said to have been killed: a 22-year-old man who the BBC says died when a building collapsed in the town of Pakokku, about 20 miles from the quake's epicenter; and two young girls who Reuters reports were killed when a riverbank collapsed in Yenanchaung township.

NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports:

""The quake was centered about 15 miles west of Chauk, a port town on the Irrawaddy River. It's not far from the ancient city and tourist mecca of Bagan, where pictures suggest that centuries-old pagodas suffered some damage. ... Buildings shook in Myanmar's two largest cities, Yangon and Mandalay. ""The quake also sent office workers running from their buildings in Bangkok, Thailand and Kolkata, India, and some public transportation in those cities was delayed or suspended.""

A fire department official in the regional capital Magwe told Reuters: ""So far as we heard from our local staff, a three-story building collapsed in Chauk and a pagoda was badly damaged in a town called Yenanchaung,""

A resident of Yenanchaung township, about 40 miles from the epicenter, told the wire service the damaged pagoda had already been cracked before the earthquake.

Posts on social media appeared to show damage to centuries-old pagodas in the popular tourist destination of Bagan, about 10 miles northeast of the earthquake epicenter.

The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake's epicenter at some 50 miles below the surface of the earth — a relatively deep location that might have helped mitigate damage."

وتعد بريطانيا أول دولة تحقق زيادة في عدد الميداليات في خمس دورات أولمبية متتالية، إضافة إلى أنها الدولة الوحيدة التي حصلت على ميداليات أكثر من تلك التي حصدتها بالدورة التي استضافتها.

ولكن كم أنفقت بريطانيا في السنوات الأربع التي سبقت أولمبياد ريو؟

تكشف صحيفة الإندبندنت البريطانية أن بريطانيا أنفقت 363 مليون دولار على الرياضات التي شاركت في الأولمبياد، لتحقق 67 ميدالية وبعملية حسابية تكون كلفة الميدالية الواحدة 5.5 ملايين دولار.

وتدافع المسؤولة عن الرياضة البريطانية ليز نيكول عن استراتيجية الإنفاق المثيرة للجدل بالقول إن هذه الأموال تنفق على رياضيين يجلبون الميداليات ويسعدون الشعب البريطاني ويشعرونه بالفخر.

وأنفقت بريطانيا نحو 21 مليون دولار على منتخب الهوكي للنساء ليحصل على الذهبية، بينما أنفقت نحو ثلاثة ملايين دولار على منتخب الرماية للحصول على برونزتين. وعن هذا تقول المسؤولة الرياضية إنه ""لو لم تفز البعثة بهذا العدد من الميداليات كنا تعرضنا لهجوم وسائل الإعلام، وهذا ما حصل في اليومين الأولين من الأولمبياد، لأننا لم نحرز أي ميدالية"" وتشير استطلاعات الرأي -حسب نيكول- أن الشعب البريطاني كان خلف البعثة وكان داعمها الأول لتحقيق نتائج طيبة وأفضل من أولمبياد لندن2012، وهذا ما حصل.

في السياق قال رئيس اللجنة الأولمبية البريطانية إن بعثة ريو كانت مستاءة من عدم مشاركة الاتحاد الإنجليزي لكرة القدم بمنتخبي رجال ونساء في مسابقة الكرة، وأضاف أنه تتم مخاطبة الاتحاد لتحضير منتخبين منذ اليوم للمشاركة في أولمبياد طوكيو 2020."

Popularni sarajevski imam, hafiz Sulejman Bugari je donio odluku da napusti Bosnu i Hercegovinu i svoj angažman nastavi u okviru Islamske zajednice u Crnoj Gori.

S obzirom da je ovih dana u široj javnosti postavljano mnogo puta pitanje koji je razlog odlaska, hafiz Bugari na to pitanje za Preporod dao je sljedeći odgovor: „Razlog moga prelaska u Podgoricu niti je moja želja niti želja institucije u kojoj radim niti sam ikada razmišljao o tome da idem sa ovih prostora. Ni sada ne idem, samo mijenjam lokaciju tijelom, ali dušom sam tu gdje jesam. A i tijelom ću, po pozivu mojih institucija i drugih, s ljubavlju ovdje dolaziti. Međutim uvijek Božija volja treba biti preča od naših želja, prohtjeva i komfora. Niko me nije primorao, niti me je tražio, a što je od Njega to se mora i to s 'pjesmom' prihvatiti. Dakako, insan može i da odbije, jer ima slobodnu volju“.

Iz kancelarije glavnog imama Medžlisa islamske zajednice Sarajevo, poručuju da nikada nije bilo konflikta sa hafizom Bugarijem, ni u prenesenom smislu, te izražavaju dozu žaljenja zbog njegovog odlaska iz Bosne i Hercegovine.

Iznenađeni odlaskom

„Hafiz Sulejman Bugari je kod nas radio 17 godina, od 1999. godine, svojevoljno odlazi nakon tako dugog perioda. Nama je žao što odlazi, njegova misija je bila izuzetno plemenita i u svrsi imama i svrsi osobe koja oko sebe okuplja omladinu na ideji propagiranja dobra. Njegova savjetodavna djelatnost je sačuvala mnoštvo brakova i mnogima je pomogla da se pronađu u životu“, poručuje se iz kancelarije glavnog imama u Sarajevu.

Uprkos velikom doprinosu i pozitivnom imidžu u Islamskoj zajednici BiH nisu mogli uticati na Bugarijevu odluku, uz objašnjenje da je to njegovo pravo.

„Na kraju krajeva to je njegov izbor, mi ne možemo na to uticati, jer svako u našoj zajednici može ići za boljim i poslovnim i životnim prilikama. Uvaženi hafiz Sulejman Bugari je imao potpunu komociju i fleksibilnost na svom radnom mjestu imama, imao je mogućnost da putuje i drži predavanja pored obnašanja osnovne funkcije u svojoj džamiji. Odluka o odlasku nas je ipak iznenadila“, navodi se.

Sulejman Bugari je uvijek dobrodošao da se vrati u Islamsku zajednicu BiH i Sarajevo koje ga smatra i više od svog građanina.

„Mi ističemo, ukoliko Bugari odluči nekim slučajem da se vrati u Bosnu i Hercegovinu, on je uvijek dobrodošao u Sarajevo, uvijek se može vratiti na svoj stari posao, njemu su vrata širom otvorena“, poručeno je iz kancelarije glavnog imama Medžlisa islamske zajednice Sarajevo.



Džamija u kojoj je dugo godina služio Bugari [Al Jazeera]

U dvorištu džamije gdje je Sulejman Bugari služio u funkciji imama okupljaju se ljudi koji se žele pozdraviti sa hafizom prije nego što napusti Sarajevo. Neposredno pred podnevnu molitvu ispred džamije se našao i Selver Fatić iz Hadžića kod Sarajeva.

„Da budem iskren, nisam lično blizak sa hafizom Sulejmanom Bugarijem, vidio sam ga uživo svega nekoliko puta, ali njegova riječ i djela su mi bliži nego mnogi ljudi koje poznajem. Jednostavno, želio sam ukoliko je moguće da ga poselamim i zahvalim na inspiraciji i dobroti koju propagira. Ja sam krenuo da ga vidim, a ako ne bude bio tu, halal mu bilo“, kazao je Fatić.

Crnogorska euforija

Sa druge strane, u Crnoj Gori, muslimani su sa oduševljenjem dočekali vijest o dolasku uvaženog hafiza na te prostore.

„Islamska zajednica u Crnoj Gori je počašćena njegovim dolaskom, on je sam po sebi jedno veliko ime, i Islamskoj zajednici u Crnoj Gori je upravo nedostajao jedan da'ija (misionar) poput njega. Osim toga, na terenu, džematlije su još u nevjerici da dolazi hafiz Bugari jer su svjesni o kakvom čovjeku je riječ“, kazao je Fuad Čekić, sekretar islamske zajednice u Crnoj Gori.

O dolasku Sulejmana Bugarija na prostor Crne Gore ranije nije bilo govora, uposlenici Islamske zajednice su prilično iznenađeni.

„Nisam upoznat da li je ranije bilo riječi o inicijativi i najavI da će Bugari doći u Crnu Goru, i sama činjenica da se sprema da dođe, stvarno je iznenadila sve članove Islamske zajednice u Crnoj Gori. Inicijativa da pređe u Islamsku zajednicu Crne Gore je objeručke prihvaćena, svi članovi naše zajednice su se obradovali i pozdravili tu odluku, te svi očekuju dobru saradnju sa uvaženim hafizom“, navodi Čekić.

„Prije otprilike godinu dana, Islamska zajednica u Crnoj Gori je promijenila svoj ustav, čime je predviđeno formiranje novih radnih jedinica u okviru čega je definisan angažman osobe na polju misionarstva - da've. Tu poziciju će sada, uz funkciju savjetnika reisa Islamske zajednice u Crnoj Gori pokrivati Sulejman Bugari“, navodi se.

Potpuna fleksibilnost

Sulejman Bugari za sada neće imati angažmana u svojstvu imama u džamiji, njegova primarna radna funkcija će biti na mjestu savjetnika reisa Rifata Fejzića, a navodi se da je osnovni preduslov njegovog angažmana bio puna fleksibilnost i mogućnost da samoinicijativno djeluje.

„Nije predviđeno da hafiz Bugari obavlja funkciju imama, njegov angažman će biti baziran na polju savjetnika reisa, na poslovima da've, a pretpostavljamo da će imati nekog angažmana u našoj medresi. Kao savjetniku reisa, naša Islamska zajednica će uvaženom hafizu pružiti maksimalnu podršku i osigurati fleksibilnost da on sam kreira svoje aktivnosti. Mislimo da je njegovo iskustvo za nas dragocjeno i nema nikakve potrebe da neko mimo njega koordiniše rad na polju misionarske djelatnosti“, rekao je Fuad Čekić, sekretar Islamske zajednice u Crnoj Gori.

Dolazak Bugarija je osjetan među muslimanima u svim dijelovima Crne Gore, glavni imam u Baru Muidin Milaimi, sa velikom euforijom očekuje dolazak novog kolege i bliskog prijatelja.

„Vijest o odlasku Sulejmana Bugarija iz Sarajeva je i za nas imame u Crnoj Gori žalosna, a istovremeno se osjećamo privilegovano što će neko tako velik doći na naše prostore. Naši džemati se raduju njegovom dolasku prije svega, zbog njegove harizme i jedinstvenog pristupa ljudima. Očekujemo da će sa svoje nove radne pozicije savjetnika reisa, u Crnoj Gori doprinijeti afirmaciji islama na našim prostorima“, kazao je Muidin Milaimi.

Odluka o selidbi Bugarija u Podgoricu je argumentovana potrebom tamošnje Islamske zajednice za uticajnim kadrom, a sa druge strane, iz Bosne i Hercegovine se procjenjuje da je odluka bazirana na boljoj poslovnoj prilici, oni koji poznaju uvaženog hafiza kažu, većem dobru.

Plus, we take a look at Globo, Brazil's media giant.

On The Listening Post this week: Why is Facebook on warring terms with ad blockers? And how will this evolving relationship manifest for the user? Plus, an inside look at Brazil's media giant Globo.

Facebook vs ad blockers: It's all about the money

Facebook has declared war against ad blockers and says protecting revenues for media outlets was a key motivating factor. We take a look at what the Facebook vs ad blocker battle means for users, publishers and for Facebook's own business model.

Talking us through the story are: Ben Williams, PR manager, Adblock Plus; Justin Schlosberg, lecturer in journalism and media at Birkbeck University; Lara O'Reilly, senior editor at Business Insider; Raghav Bahl, founder of Quintillion Media.

On our radar:

The media story in Turkey just keeps getting bigger. This past week, another newspaper was shut down, one of the country's best-known editors resigned and numerous Twitter accounts have been blocked.

Journalists in India, who recently published an expose on a political group with close ties to the country's ruling party, have found themselves exposed and are now under investigation.

Gawker, the New York-based news site known for its click-bait journalism and its scandal sheet style, is being shut down by its new owner.

Globo: Brazil's media behemoth

Rede Globo isn't just dominant in Brazil, it's Latin America's biggest media network. We profile the media giant's history, politics and power to influence the national agenda. The Listening Post's Paolo Ganino reports.

Talking us through the story are: Paulo Henrique Amorim, journalist (formerly Globo); David Miranda, The Intercept; Silvio Caccia Bava, editor-in-chief, Le Monde Diplomatique Brasil; Gregorio Duvivier, actor and writer.
